<SPEECH PAGE="5187" SPEAKER="Mr SPEAKER" NAMEID="10000" ELECTORATE="PO" PARTY="N/A" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="10000">Mr SPEAKER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the 97th Inter-Parliamentary Union Conference held in Seoul and the subsequent bilateral visit to Japan from 10 to 21 April 1997. The 97th Inter-Parliamentary Union Conference debated and discussed a range of topics, including regional security and peace, sustainable development, the status of the Holy City of Jerusalem and the emergency situations in Albania and Zaire. All members of the delegation played an active role throughout the entire conference, participating in all facets of the conference agenda. I would like to take the opportunity to thank all members of the delegation for their companionship and assistance throughout the conference and the bilateral visit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has become apparent over the last few years that the IPU must review its practices, in order to remain the pre-eminent international forum for parliamentary democracy. Many reforms are under way, and other reforms are on the agenda. As part of this reform agenda, the Australian delegation felt it necessary to make a number of recommendations and conclusions which, it believes, will assist in making the IPU a more focused and effective international forum. I will leave it up to my colleagues to discuss some of these proposals. However, having taken a leading role in the reform process, I believe it is vitally important that the Australian delegation sends a very strong and experienced contingent to the Cairo conference, so as to ensure that a number of very important matters left unresolved at the Seoul conference are dealt with adequately and effectively.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While in South Korea, members of the delegation took the opportunity to visit the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> demilitarised zone. Visitors can be sidetracked by the propaganda that is evident through the construction of rival buildings in the zone, the erection of bigger flagpoles, the parading and positioning of soldiers and the strict adherence to a set of protocols, but it does not take long for visitors to be reminded of the very serious side of the DMZ.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the situation between the north and the south remains tense, there is a glimmer of hope in the President Clinton initiative to establish four-party peace talks involving both the north and south, as well as China and the United States. The delegation wholeheartedly supports this initiative, in the hopes that there will be a breakthrough in the negotiations and that a path towards normalisation of relations can be achieved. Tragically, the famine in the north has compounded the conflict, to the extent that the North Koreans are unwilling to allow aid to flow freely into the country, which would help relieve some of the misery and starvation faced by many millions of its people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Turning now to the bilateral visit to Japan, I would like to make a few brief comments. Our relationship is not simply one centred on trade. As former Prime Minister Nakasone told the delegation, Australia and Japan form the pivotal north-south axis in the all important Asia-Pacific region. It is, therefore, in both our interests to consolidate existing ties and forge new agreements so that we can maintain a very prominent alliance in what is the fastest growing region in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of our bilateral relationship, Australia is now seen as a natural partner to Japan in the region, in which we share a range of very similar interests. Defence links have entered a new phase, with a number of discussions taking place in recent times, and this has added a further dimension to the relationship whereby each country has come to rely on the other's support in both regional and international forums in recent years. We appreciate that support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the low economic growth experienced by Japan over recent years and its mounting public debt, all other economic indicators&mdash;such as low unemployment, low inflation, healthy current account surplus and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5188"> strong investments&mdash;would be the envy of any other developed economy. While other countries would be more than satisfied with these fundamentals, Japan knows that it must push on with its program of reform if it is to retain its pre-eminent position in the Asia-Pacific region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the trade front, there are emerging signs of great potential in many areas, particularly in the light of the reforms currently under way in Japan and the freeing up of many of the overregulated and highly protected markets. However, to be successful in these markets, an entirely different marketing strategy must be undertaken. Australian firms need to be in touch with end users and respond to their specific needs and tastes rather than simply develop a product and try to sell it into the Japanese market. Quality, not volume, will win the day, particularly if the product meets the very high health and safety standards demanded by the Japanese consumer. Australia has a strong comparative advantage in agricultural production, underpinned by a clean, natural resource base. Australia must continue to promote its position as a leading supplier of safe, high quality fresh and processed foods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before leaving Tokyo for visits to Kyoto and Osaka, the delegation made a very moving and emotional visit to the Yokohama British Commonwealth War Cemetery, to lay a wreath and pay its respects to the Australian service personnel who lost their lives in World War II. This is the only Commonwealth cemetery in Japan, and provides a focal point for visitors to reflect on the ultimate sacrifice made by fellow countrymen and to contemplate the prospects of lasting peace and prosperity for people from both sides of the conflict.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe the visit provided the delegation with a very good opportunity to explore many aspects of the relationship. While many other new relationships are being forged in the Asia-Pacific region by both Japan and Australia, none of them will diminish&mdash;in any way, shape or form&mdash;the very strong and broad based relationship that has been built upon by our two countries over the last 25 years. On the contrary, I believe this relation 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ship will continue to grow and be a major catalyst in the forging of other strong and lasting ties in the region. The delegation looks forward to further visits between both countries, so as to strengthen the very close relationship and continue to pursue matters of mutual interest.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the report to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At a time when visits by parliamentarians overseas are under scrutiny&mdash;and I have been involved in a number as minister as well as parliamentarian&mdash;I think it is quite critical that the public at large know it is essential, if Australia is going to play a role, that we do not stay in isolation in the South Pacific. Certainly, from the perspective of members of this parliament, this IPU delegation report reflects contributions in two areas of great importance to this nation. The first is in the Inter&hyphen;Parliamentary Union, and the second is in the bilateral visit to Japan. The report identifies the contents of our journey, the people we met, the discussions we held and the conclusions we reached.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of the Inter&hyphen;Parliamentary Union, I know that it is hard measuring the benefit of international fora. The United Nations is regarded by many as being at the apex of these with its agencies and with the general plenary session, which occurs each year and to which foreign ministers around the world express their views. I feel in a way there should be a relationship between the IPU and the United Nations, and I think it is a pity that there is not a formal submission to the United Nations&mdash;presumably in plenary session although perhaps in Security Council&mdash;of those recommendations that emerge from each Inter&hyphen;Parliamentary Union Conference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our delegation at the IPU meeting in Seoul looked specifically at ways in which we could make the IPU more effective and, hopefully, more productive. To that there were a number of recommendations. The first being that we feel that in budget form we need to identify the ways in which the funds spent are, in fact, returning benefits to the members' countries. One of those recommendations we have made on page 21 of this report suggests that the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5189"> IPU executive should report back to the next IPU council meeting&mdash;which is to be held in Cairo in September this year&mdash;on the cost benefits of maintaining a New York office, which is about to be opened, expressly to try to improve the contact with the United Nations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second recommendation is in the budget generally. Senator John Watson, who was one of the members of the delegation, made a number of specific recommendations regarding recommendations of its auditors and introducing program budgeting as part of the IPU's financial accounting system. Again, those matters were referred to in this report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously one of the difficulties with the IPU is that it is a very disparate group. With respect to the degree to which we as parliamentarians attend, there is only on rare occasions a continuity sufficient to allow our full participation in the committees of the IPU&mdash;although both the former Speaker, the present member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay) and the member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) have been continuing members of two important committees: one on Cyprus and the other on human rights. I think the role they played is worth while. The other area to which the report refers is the role of women in the group. I think it is essential that Australia always has a woman in its delegation, as the role of women parliamentarians is increasingly being examined by the IPU.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the few minutes left to me, the other point that I wanted to comment on was the bilateral visit to Japan at a time when everybody is concerned about our relations with China. There are too few who really recognise the role of Japan to Australia, and I commend our recommendations in that respect.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, I present the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> committee's report on the inquiry into the conduct of the 1996 federal election and the matters related thereto, incorporating dissenting reports, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The 1996 federal election</EMPHASIS> , together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ordered that the report be printed.</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OK6">Mr NAIRN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The committee received 135 submissions and conducted seven public hearings as well as extensive consultation with the Australian Electoral Commission. First of all, I want to thank all members of the committee for their valuable input and for the often stimulating debate generated. In particular, I want to recognise the work of the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb), who was the chairman of this committee up til April. He steered the committee through all hearings and through the preparation of the bulk of the report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report is in three parts: the majority report and two minority reports&mdash;one by the Australian Labor Party members of the committee and one by the Australian Democrat member. Very few members of the House will find that particularly surprising, given the subject matter of the inquiry. However, I must say that, although there are two minority reports, the greater part of the report is supported by all members of the committee. For example, the Australian Labor Party members' minority report addresses only 14 of the total of 73 recommendations. Senator Murray, on behalf of the Australian Democrats, addresses 10 of the recommendations&mdash;four being in common with the ALP&mdash;and also makes some additional recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the short time that I have here today to speak on the report, I would like to highlight some of the conclusions and recommendations of the committee. It can be quite successfully argued that we have a very good electoral system and the fact that, on 2 March 1996, 11,294,302 people cast their vote at 7,865 polling places in a totally peaceful manner is a living example of its success. However, it is the parliament's responsibility to ensure that we maintain the best possible system, and that can be done through regular review of elections and the Commonwealth Electoral Act. The integrity of the electoral roll is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5190"> fundamental to the maintenance of the community's confidence in elections.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently, the process that enables individuals to enrol is subject to a far lower level of security than such lesser transactions as opening a bank account, applying for a passport, registering for social security benefits and, indeed, obtaining membership at your local video store. Virtually everyone eligible for enrolment undertakes one or more of these transactions. The majority of the committee, therefore, recommends a similar system apply when enrolling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our two recommendations with respect to this are, firstly, that the enrolment form be witnessed by a person who is on the electoral roll rather than merely eligible to be enrolled and that that person be someone who fits the prescribed class of persons to be nominated by the AEC and, secondly, that at least one original item of documentary proof of identity be provided when enrolling. This could be such things as a photographic drivers licence, a birth certificate, social security papers such as a notice or an advice of a pension, a passport, a Medicare card, et cetera or a written reference for a limited range of people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Everyone will recall the Albert Langer saga at the time of the 1996 election. All members of the committee wanted to ensure that such a situation did not occur again. Therefore, we have recommended the repealing of those provisions of the act that led to Mr Langer's imprisonment. We have also recommended that, at an appropriate federal election, a referendum be held to amend section 44 of the constitution whereby the office of profit disqualification apply from the start of a member of parliament's term rather than from the time of nomination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also we have recommended that the reference to foreign allegiance be deleted and the constitution amended to make Australian citizenship a necessary qualification for the membership of the parliament. These amendments will overcome the various court challenges that occurred not only after last year's election but also previous ones. Other recommendations include the repeal of compulsory voting, a ban on misleading statements in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> election advertising, subdivisional voting, and improvements to election funding and financial disclosure laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In closing, I thank Bill Gray, the Electoral Commissioner, and his staff for the many submissions and excellent cooperation his organisation gave to the committee. I also thank Chris Paterson, Russell Chafer and the staff of the committee secretariat for their assistance in producing this report.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As one of the chairmen for most of the hearings of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters and for the meetings that went into this report into the 1996 federal election, it is a report that I highly recommend and am immensely proud of. I would particularly like to thank the committee secretary, Chris Paterson, and the inquiry secretary, Russel Chafer, for the great support they extended to me throughout the inquiry. I would also like to thank the other staff; the present chairman, the member for Eden&hyphen;Monaro (Mr Nairn); the Australian Electoral Commission; and all other committee members who worked very cooperatively and harmoniously throughout the hearings&mdash;and that includes all parties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe this is the most far&hyphen;reaching report on reform to our electoral system that has ever been presented to parliament. At the last election we had over 11&half; million people on the rolls, of which 96 per cent cast a vote at a cost of just under $5 a vote. We have a very good&mdash;if not the best&mdash;system in the world, but it could be even better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Central to this report is upgrading the integrity of the electoral roll. We put high emphasis on this. As the member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Nairn) said, it is unacceptable that the most fundamental transaction between the citizen and the government&mdash;namely, the act of choosing the government at a democratic election&mdash;is subject to a far lower level of security than such lesser transactions as opening a bank account, getting your name down at a video shop, applying for a passport, applying for a drivers licence or registering for social security benefits. It is ridiculous to say that we cannot do this with our electoral system because it will hurt the poor and the illiterate, when they readily handle these 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5191"> systems in the other areas that I have just mentioned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have recommended that we upgrade the witnessing requirement on the enrolment form and that electors be asked to produce at least one form of identity when enrolling, such as a birth certificate, a drivers licence or social security registration papers. We have recommended that the government be allowed to crosscheck election data with other government departments and authorities, such as the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Social Security, the Australian Taxation Office, local government, post offices, Telstra, et cetera. There are very few transgressions that we know of with people voting, but if we can upgrade this area it will take away a lot of the criticism, warranted or otherwise, that does exist and put a lot more confidence into our election system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Compulsory voting has been with us in this country since 1922. We have made a recommendation that we move towards a voluntary voting system. Even if that lies on the table and is not taken up, I believe it is worth while having it there because it will stimulate debate. There are only about six small countries in the world that have compulsory voting such as Cyprus and Nauru. The great democracies of the world&mdash;the United States, Britain, Germany, France and even our near neighbour New Zealand&mdash;all get along very well on voluntary voting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe it is wrong that people who have a conscientious objection to compulsory voting and who refuse to pay their fine for not doing so are ultimately put in gaol. After the 1993 election, 43 people went to gaol. After all, in this country we do not actually have strictly compulsory voting, we have only compulsory attendance. You can be dishonest by turning up, having your name ticked off and then throwing your voting papers away. But if you are honest about it and do not turn up, you are fined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am delighted to see truth in advertising is among the recommendations in this report. I was actually the first person to introduce a private member's motion in this chamber calling for this after the 1993 election. It is based on the South Australian legislation, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> which bans inaccurate statements of fact. In the time it has been working in South Australia, it seems to work very well indeed. I accept that in some cases it could be difficult to police and may need adjustment at a later stage, but the mere fact that we will now have it on the books in this country, I think will severely curtail the blatant lying and misrepresentation that has gone on in some instances in the past during election campaigns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am conscious of the time that is allotted to this debate. I know that others want to speak, so I will finalise my statements at this point. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The majority report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters is certainly a landmark document. It shows clearly and unambiguously the intention of factions within the coalition to turn our current electoral system on its head. It shows their commitment to undermining a system that has served this nation well for many years and it shows their willingness to pursue an ideological agenda with little or no basis in fact. As to their likely success in this endeavour, we will have to await the response of the government to this report to determine whether their agenda is embraced by their party leadership.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The time available to me today allows me to address only some of the issues contained within the report and then only in a cursory fashion. However, if the government accepts the extreme recommendations contained in the report, I can assure those opposite that any such legislation will be debated long and hard both here and in the other chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government claimed it would govern for all of us, but this report is designed to alter our electoral system in a way that will result in only some of us being able to participate. For example, the various recommendations regarding changes to enrolment procedures will make it harder for people to be validly enrolled to vote. The coalition committee members want to cut back the time allowed for people to get on the electoral roll or to alter their enrolment details to take into account changes of address after an election 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5192"> is called. This will clearly disenfranchise large numbers of Australians. They also seek to make it more difficult to enrol by creating additional obstacles through the requirement of documentary proof of identity and by requiring that only certain prescribed classes of persons will be allowed to witness enrolment forms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These recommendations are based on the premise that significant fraud currently occurs&mdash;that large numbers of people are currently enrolled illegally. This is clearly not the case. The committee was not presented with any substantive material indicating the existence of such fraud. In fact, nothing other than some anecdotal and hearsay comments were received. None of these claims is substantiated, and in many cases they were discredited in evidence received by the committee. To quote from the minority report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AEC has effectively countered the statistical, legal and practical bases of these assertions. Even the Majority Report has detailed that, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">"the Inquiry did not reveal improper enrolment or voting sufficient to affect any result at the election." </EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Despite the lack of evidence provided, the coalition committee members seem determined to pursue their agenda. The result, if implemented, will be to complicate and discourage enrolment for many ordinary Australians&mdash;ordinary Australians that this government proudly claims are Howard's battlers. Apparently they are not confident these battlers will remain with them in the years to come.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Subdivision voting, which is also proposed to be implemented, again will seriously inconvenience many voters while exercising their democratic rights. The situation is that something like 35 per cent of voters will tend to vote outside the booths directly in the area in which they live. The circumstance under subdivisional voting is that they will be seriously inconvenienced in terms of exercising their vote.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other issues in this report which are of significance, and which earlier speakers have commented on, particularly concern the question of voluntary voting. With voluntary voting, we have something which is of particular significance and at the very basis of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> our electoral system. The fact is there is no strong support in the community for voluntary voting. Opinion polls do not show this support. Polls of members of this parliament and of candidates at the last election show there is not that strong support. The committee itself took virtually no evidence and had minimal discussion on the issue of voluntary voting and yet a major component of this report is about voluntary voting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As was mentioned earlier by the member for Parkes (Mr Cobb), we do not have compulsory voting as such. We have, in effect, a requirement to compulsorily attend a booth and have one's name crossed off. Even now, some people who do not wish to exercise their vote will have their name crossed off and can vote informally or can destroy their papers. That does happen&mdash;we have all seen that. But the requirement to vote is really a requirement to attend, so those who argue that people are forced to vote are incorrect. Those who argue that voluntary voting is the way forward for this country are also quite wrong in the circumstances. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will take a few moments to make some comments in relation to this report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. It was certainly pleasing to be a member of the committee that conducted this inquiry. I certainly believe it to be a very important inquiry in that it reviewed the election of 1996 and the Electoral Act, and I believe that the recommendations put forward in this report actually highlight the changing nature of our democracy. One of the most important things that we must do when carrying out any inquiry like this is to address our democracy as it evolves and therefore, at the same time, address that through recommendations to the government to change the act so that it may address those important changes that the people in the community do see.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that some members on the other side of the House find some of the recom 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5193"> mendations a little bit hard to adopt because of their ideological beliefs or their beliefs in what they see as taking place, but I would just like to quickly address three recommendations. Firstly, I support very strongly the proof of identity. The chairman of the committee has already made some comments in this area, but to me the most important thing is that, if you are going to be on the electoral roll of Australia, you have to prove who you are to be on that roll. If it is important to have the proof that is needed, as mentioned before, to have a bank account, to be able to get a passport and to be able to travel from this country and to be able to come back into this country, I believe it is as important to have that identification to be on the electoral roll itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I certainly support the recommendation of non&hyphen;compulsory  voting. I support it on very simple terms and that is: it is your right in a democracy to vote and therefore it is your right not to vote, and to have non&hyphen;compulsory voting, I believe, is an important recommendation and I certainly urge the government to support that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do acknowledge that the other member would like to make a few more comments and I will leave my comments at that point.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;In the short time left, I will make a couple of very brief points around the issues I was going on with before.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that the voluntary voting issue has been a debate within the coalition over some time with particular members, including Senator Minchin, who is a member of the committee, quite strongly of the view that this is an issue that the coalition should pursue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite clear that, although I think some members of the committee are doing this on altruistic and decent motives from their own point of view, the fact is that there is seen to be a political advantage through this process. There is an amount of evidence in the minority report from the ALP which details some of these issues, and the fact is that there is clearly a view amongst the coalition, or amongst elements of the coalition, that they do not think that lower socio&hyphen;economic groups, and particularly Labor voters, will 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> actually vote in a non&hyphen;compulsory system and therefore they will have an advantage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to make a couple of brief comments on the question of donations. There is a recommendation in this report which will allow an increase from $1,500 to $10,000 in donations to registered political parties from individuals before a return must be furnished. This clearly is designed to assist the big end of town around the question of donations to political parties and is something which will advantage the Liberal Party and is clearly being pushed on partisan political grounds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to join with others and thank the committee secretariat for the work they have done in preparing this document. I would concur with the chair of the committee that there are certainly aspects of this report and quite significant components of it that are in fact not bad news for the system. I would like to congratulate the former chair of the committee also for the work that he did. But I would say that the genesis of the main meat in this report is bad for the Australian electoral system.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I present the committee's report on the visit of the Defence Subcommit 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5194"> tee to Exercise Tandem Thrust 1997 on 12 to 14 March 1997, together with the minutes of proceedings, and move that the report be printed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ordered that the report be printed.</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5E4">Mr SINCLAIR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exercise Tandem Thrust was conducted in March this year. It was a combined field training exercise off the Queensland coast and in the Shoalwater Bay training area, near Rockhampton. Unlike many previous major defence exercises hosted by the ADF which involved many nations, Exercise Tandem Thrust involved only the Australian and United States forces.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was direct participation by over 21,000 US personnel, almost 6,000 members of the Australian Defence Force, 43 naval vessels and over 200 aircraft. The exercise was the first truly combined, all&hyphen;environment, strategic level activity conducted between the forces of the two nations since World War II. That is, it provided the opportunity for senior Australian defence staff to participate in strategic planning on an equal basis, rather than taking a role subordinate to a United States command structure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The exercise itself was an important outcome of the AUSMIN talks held in July last year with the Joint Security Declaration, also known as the Sydney Statement, setting down Tandem Thrust as a major step towards ADF/US Pacific command vision for future combined operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee was pleased to meet members of the Defence Force and have an opportunity to visit the exercise. One of the key outcomes was to test our military interoperability with the United States. In doing so, one of the significant concerns identified was that the ADF currently lags the US military in the fields of communication and information systems. The subcommittee was shown a number of innovative software applications and communications systems used in the field by the ADF. Of themselves, these were encouraging and some particularly so. However, as the US military aggressively develops its capabilities, we certainly need to be aware that as we fall behind, our ability to maintain contact within elements of the Australian Defence Force is more limited than 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> it should be. I commend close attention to this field, as I believe that this area should be afforded priority in ADF force development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The subcommittee also observed other aspects of the exercise which were a source of some concern. Prime amongst these was the degree to which, in the presence of Cyclone Justin, it was not possible to proceed with the amphibious landing. The marines, on the other hand, were able to proceed with their landing because they had a helicopter capability which ensured that, although the seas were such and the weather was such, they were able to proceed on a basis which allowed them to bring their men ashore and to proceed with the amphibious part of the landing. In that respect, I am concerned about the intention of the navy to acquire the Kaman Seasprite. It seems to me we would have been far better to have proceeded with more Seahawks, even though they might have been fewer in number, to maintain a similarity to that of the Black Hawk, and to ensure that we had a greater defence capability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Environmentally, a lot happened there and I would like to commend those who ensured that the exercise was conducted in a way that those who raised concerns before the exercise about the environmental consequences could feel quite satisfied that the environmental aspect was well and truly recognised by the commander of the exercise control group, Rear Admiral Kenneth Fisher of the United States Navy, and all participants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The subcommittee's visit did provide an excellent opportunity for us to see the ADF operating in the field and to meet with individual personnel. My only regret was that so few members of the committee were able to participate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to pay particular credit to Wing Commander Paul Hyslop, who is the Defence attache attached to the Defence Subcommittee, for the work he has done in preparing this report and, of course, also to Jane Vincent, the secretary to the committee and to Eleanor Hull, who was on the subcommittee staff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report is a vehicle by which, hopefully, we might be able better to identify the relationship between the parliament and the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5195"> Defence Force on future occasions and I certainly commend the concept of Tandem Thrust for future consideration, although I would hope that in the future Australia might take a more leading role in setting the course of the exercise, rather than have Australia virtually subordinate to the US Marines, as seemed to be the case in many instances on this occasion.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OJ4">Mr TAYLOR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you very much. I would like to add a few comments to what the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) indicated. I was part of the subcommittee visiting this exercise, and I would like to reinforce one or two points. Firstly, this is a very significant issue which I am sure will be addressed in the defence reform program which is under way at the direction of the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan)&mdash;a point which was included in the report&mdash;relating to interoperability and as a result, command control, computer operations and intelligence, which are so important in the future structure and operational viability of the Australian Defence Force. As the right honourable member has indicated and as is indicated in the report, when you look at what the ADF does in these areas in the field, as we saw in Tandem Thrust, it does look&mdash;I am reluctant to use the term second rate&mdash;somewhat mediocre when compared with high tech defence forces like those of the United States. We saw that with the Marine Corps, as was indicated, in the field. I think we need to do something about that. I am aware that things are happening in that area; nevertheless, it is an aspect of Australian Defence Force operations which needs some impetus. One would hope that, as a result of the reform program under way, that will be addressed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, and again this is a point which relates to another element of the Defence Force which is being restructured at the moment, there is the restructuring of the army. The army, one might say, has become 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the poor cousin of the three services. There was a major review into the army into the next century, and there is a trial under way to correct the situation over time. We saw one reflection of that in the report; it talked about the forward support battalion concept. I have to say that, from our observation, it did not quite know what it had to do. That, of course, is one element of addressing the problem for the army in the future. We have had briefings since, and perhaps our impressions are not altogether accurate. Nevertheless, I think something has to be done, particularly for the army to become a more mobile and a more effective service within the Australian Defence Force environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I enjoyed the visit. I suppose my big disappointment&mdash;putting on my old naval cap&mdash;was when we went out to the carrier group in the carrier on board delivery aircraft and, after three attempts, we did not take the wire because of the weather. That was disappointing for me and I am sure it was disappointing for my colleagues. Nevertheless, we saw total operational cooperation between our defence forces; they can only go from strength to strength. I endorse everything that is reflected in the report. Once again, I hope that the defence reform program over the next year or so repeats the benefits that are indicated at the moment.</PARA></SPEECH>

It specifically targets ships registered in Panama&mdash;a flag state which has a long&hyphen;established record of poor or non&hyphen;compliance with the provisions of the international maritime safety conventions to which it is party. Panama, which is referred to in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of Shame</EMPHASIS> , is one of the world's flags of shame.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Time does not permit me to detail the events associated with the MV <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hunter</EMPHASIS> from the time of its arrival off Port Newcastle on 12 January 1997 until its departure with a cargo of coal for Chile on 28 January 1997. Some of the details are set out in my speeches in the grievance and adjournment debates of 24 and 25 March 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In those speeches, I called on the Australian Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) to, firstly, look at all the circumstances of this event and bear in mind that, in this case, the issue should be taken up in the strongest possible terms with the Panamanian government with a view to ensuring that ships wearing the Panamanian flag adhere to the international obligations 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> they have under international maritime conventions, and with a view to ensuring that the Panamanian government itself carries out its obligations by ensuring that ships registered under its flag meet the requirements and the obligations it is required to ensure they meet and, secondly, to give a commitment not to allow Australian law to be used by foreign shipping corporations to evade the international maritime obligations for safety at sea and treatment of crew.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I called on our government to raise in the strongest terms with the Panamanian government the failure of ships registered in Panama to comply with international maritime regulations and Panama's failure to carry out its flag state obligations. To date, I have no indication from the minister that the government has taken action as I requested. I repeat those calls to the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia has established a good reputation for maritime safety in the world. Australia's domestic law must not become a tool to be used by substandard foreign shipowners and operators to seek to get around their obligations for safe ship operation and proper crew treatment. That is what the owners of the MV <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hunter</EMPHASIS> are attempting to do by their action in the Federal Court of Australia, No. NG41 of 1997. That action is between the Associated Euro&hyphen;Atlantic Shipping Corporation as the applicant, and the Maritime Union of Australia as first respondent. Trevor Charles of the International Transport Federation is the second respondent, Laurie Steen of the Maritime Union of Australia is the third respondent, and Port Waratah Coal Services is the fourth respondent. That action is due for directions on 14 July 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By suing these parties the owners and managers of the ship are trying to prevent persons and organisations in Australia assisting crew members of the MV <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hunter</EMPHASIS> receive their proper entitlements and the safe operation of the ship. The owners of MV <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hunter</EMPHASIS>, the Associated Euro&hyphen;Atlantic Shipping Corporation of London and Polembros Maritime Co. Ltd of Piraeus, the ship manager but also the beneficial owner of the ship, are rogue operators. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5197">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another ship with a similar problem, another ship of shame, is MV <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Glory Cape</EMPHASIS>. Its Indonesian radio operator, Budi Santosi, after being beaten with iron bars by the ship's officers, in the company of five other Indonesian crew members went over the side of the ship in the early hours of 1 November 1995 off Port Hedland, constituting an infamous episode in shipping history in Australia. Santosi died in the water before help came but he had radioed for help before going over the side. Police have not investigated Santosi's death. The Western Australian coroner's office is considering an inquest, but today those responsible for his murder have got off scot-free.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In answer to a question on notice I addressed to the minister, I have been told that the Maritime Safety Authority has not advised Panama of Santosi's death. Responsibility for the action rests with the Panamanian government. All parties are relying on a grey area of jurisdiction. We cannot address the government of Panama in this country because there is no Panamanian ambassador in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this motion I am asking the House to join me in calling on the government of Panama to have the ship's officers charged and the ship's managers disciplined. We call on the government of Panama to ensure that ships registered in Panama meet the international maritime safety conventions to which that nation is a party. We call on the Australian government to act on behalf of all concerned. I propose to provide the International Maritime Organisation based in London with advice of this infamous episode in shipping activities in Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A number of very unfortunate circumstances have arisen in the shipping area and the member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) has addressed a couple of those in his short remarks today. It is certainly something that all Australians 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> should be concerned about and should not condone. On 21 January 1997, Mr Rommel Salvadore Escalante, a Honduran crew member of the MV <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hunter</EMPHASIS> , jumped overboard while the vessel was at anchor off the port of Newcastle.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Escalante made allegations regarding conditions and treatment of crew, including that wages had not been paid. Under international conventions, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority can inspect ships at Australian ports to ensure compliance with international safety standards and that no threat is posed to life, property or the marine environment. Commonwealth law allows AMSA to take measures necessary to rectify physical living conditions on board where these are clearly hazardous to the safety or health of the crew. These include accommodation standards and cleanliness, the provision of food and water and safe working conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other crew complaints concerning wages or social conditions which are not hazardous to the health and safety of the crew do not fall within AMSA's responsibility under its port state control powers, but AMSA can refer crew complaints to appropriate authorities or organisations. AMSA conducted a port state control inspection of the MV <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hunter</EMPHASIS> which included an inspection of health and safety standards. Crew conditions were found to be acceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That port state control inspection of the vessel encompassed health and safety standards based on article 4 of ILO 147. Although Australia is not yet a signatory to ILO 147, it has implemented the control provisions by defining a substandard ship as one where conditions on board are clearly hazardous to health and safety. ILO 147 enables a country that receives a complaint or obtains evidence that a ship does not conform with the standards of the convention to prepare a report to the vessel's flag state and the ILO. In addition, the country may take the necessary measures to rectify conditions on board that are hazardous to safety or health. ILO 147 does not deal with rates of pay on merchant ships. Crew are able to take action through the courts to recover unpaid wages.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5198">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although AMSA did not find the crew conditions to be substandard it did detain the vessel for being unseaworthy for deficiencies in life saving, fire fighting and load line matters. After the safety deficiencies were corrected and a bond was lodged to cover the crewman's claims, the vessel sailed. There was concern regarding the length of time before port authorities and emergency services were notified by the master of the vessel of the missing crew member.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following representations by AMSA, the Panamanian authorities engaged a Sydney based representative to conduct the investigation. The report concluded that the master acted promptly on receiving knowledge of the crewman's disappearance. While the report was not as rigorous as would be expected from other more responsible flag states&mdash;and I share the concerns of the member for Shortland&mdash;subsequent discussions with the investigator established that the crewman was not required to work until about 8 a.m. the next morning. Whether or not that is a reasonable excuse they are the facts that have surfaced. The next morning action was then taken promptly to locate the crewman. The major success was to get the Panamanian authorities to undertake the investigation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is one of those areas where there is a great deal of concern. I know that there is ongoing debate, particularly in this place, with regard to the issue of cabotage and the working conditions of foreign flagged vessels operating within Australian waters. They actually undertake a smaller percentage of the freight task within Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was interesting that the member for Shortland noted some of the recommendations of the final report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS> of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure in the previous parliament. It is interesting to note that the current Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) was a member of that committee. I am sure that the recommendations and action that the member for Shortland has asked for will certainly be addressed by the minister. Fortunately in this case, the missing crewman did not suffer the same fate as the crewman off 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Western Australia. These conditions and the actions we can take are certainly things that we should all be concerned about. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the motion moved by the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris). No-one in this parliament has done more to make this parliament&mdash;indeed, the country&mdash;aware of unsafe shipping and the plight of crews, especially multi-racial Third World nationals on many ships, than has the honourable member for Shortland. When the 1992 report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS>  was brought down, it was hoped that action following this report would rid the Australian coastline of ships of shame. I believe that people are now more aware of the disgraceful condition of many ships that visit Australian ports and the threat they pose to our coastline. There are more detentions and there is more publicity. `Ships of shame' has become part of our vocabulary. Yet, as the article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Commercial News</EMPHASIS>  said recently:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is astonishing to see the same names appearing on the database month after month after month. Occasionally, it is the same ships. Sometimes it is the same owners or managers and most often it is the same charterers.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What people are not so aware of are the conditions that the crews have to work under on many of these ships. Many crews are still denied proper rates, medical care and even reimbursement of medical expenses incurred by crew members in relation to work related illnesses. Many of the crews are deliberately made multi-racial in an effort to enable the master or the officers to exercise better control over them. Too often there is inappropriate food served and at times no food at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of this ship, the MV <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hunter</EMPHASIS>, there was no fresh water. Fresh water had to be brought on board subsequent to the crew's complaints that there was no fresh water on this ship. Before the AMSA inspectors got there, fresh water was brought on to that ship. Had the AMSA inspectors not been coming, I am sure that that water would not have been brought on board. People have to understand that it is not too much of an exaggeration to say that on many of these ships we are seeing a form of labour not greatly different from 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5199"> slavery or at least bonded labour, where crews are malnourished and very badly treated indeed. Crew members who speak out or raise concerns too often disappear overboard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like the honourable member for Shortland, I have in the past highlighted the case of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Glory Cape</EMPHASIS>, where a crew member was murdered and others attacked and beaten with iron bars. In this case that we are now discussing, again crew members were mistreated and, indeed, not paid. Were it not for the officials and the work of the Maritime Union of Australia and also the International Transport Federation&mdash;and indeed the Missions to the Seamen&mdash;one wonders what the real plight of these people would be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Too often masters of vessels try to prevent the union from coming on board or making any form of contact with the crew. On many occasions, action has been taken against the MUA and the ITF aimed at preventing these unions from assisting foreign crews to collect their rightful wages and work under some sort of reasonable conditions&mdash;not something that they are not entitled to, just the wages that they had signed up for and the ordinary treatment that we would take for granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the honourable member for Shortland has outlined, it is disgraceful that some Australian lawyers are party to activities aimed at exploiting and abusing Third World seafarers. Some of these maritime lawyers are now on a retainer to watch any action by the MUA and the ITF to grab them under sections 45D and 45E. Trying to get around the laws of Australia in this way really is disgraceful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the motion says, we call on the government of Panama to ensure that ships registered under its flag comply with the provisions of the International Maritime Safety Conventions to which Panama has subscribed. It is unfortunate that we do not have an ambassador here; I am sure that if we did we would be making many trips, because Panama is one of those countries that keep coming up. We took seriously the condition of the ships; now it is time that we take seriously the condition of the crews, that we make sure that they work under conditions that are appropriate to Australia. At the moment too many of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> them are working under conditions and in circumstances that we in this country would not tolerate. They also should not have to tolerate such conditions and circumstances. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to participate in this debate and support the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) and the member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris). The motion before the House is a follow&hyphen;on from the very important report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS> , which has been alluded to by other speakers. I was privileged enough to participate in the second part of that report. As members of this House would know, the member for Shortland has almost made a life's work of following through on these particular issues. I support the motion before the parliament that the MV <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hunter</EMPHASIS>  did not comply with the provisions of the International Maritime Safety Conventions. That is really the basis of the motion before the parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should recall that here in Australia we have a chance to apply some of the things that we learnt from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS> inquiry. All Australians would be aware that we use bulk carriers to mover iron ore and other bulk commodities from the Australian shoreline to other destinations. It is often in those bulk carriers that the crews are not well catered for. The bulk carriers are often more than 17 years of age. It is interesting to note that they seem to suffer greater casualties and mishaps than ships of a younger age.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The classification or insurance societies of London and of Europe have a lot to answer for in terms of allowing those ships to travel the high seas and to have insurance premiums that are not prohibitive because of arrangements and understandings between underwriters, insurers and the shipowners. The people who suffer, as the member for Throsby quite rightly says, are those crew personnel who come from all nations, often speaking different languages, and it is very hard to police the arrangements under which they work. It would seem to me that Australia, under the leadership of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS> inquiry and the member for Shortland himself, has shown a lead around the world in developing atti 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5200"> tudes and in developing surveillance that hopefully will ensure that crewmen from Third World countries will not be exploited in the way in which they have been.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem of crews having sufficient training and certificates again was a matter that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS> report looked at in some depth, having arisen from the motion before the House that those crew members probably had no training. They were being exploited and obviously they tried to move away from those exploitative conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS> has managed to influence some of those other international maritime nations towards believing that conditions of seafaring personnel should be improved. Particularly in Australia, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority has been doing its best to ensure that some of these conditions are improved, investigated and evaluated against the sorts of standards that we would hope seafarers would enjoy here in Australia and enjoy in normal circumstances. As the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS> report alluded to, quite often the terms and conditions that seafarers worked under on some of the third class vessels were almost subhuman.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The motion before the House today is very important in that, yet again, the Australian parliament is bringing to the world's attention the fact that some people are being exploited&mdash;they will jump ship and swim ashore to avoid these terrible and horrific circumstances. Yet it is technically quite difficult to bring those ships who enjoy flags of convenience to account. This parliament, with the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS> report, is at the forefront in trying to develop better standards&mdash;better standards of ship construction, better standards of training for ship personnel, and better standards of surveillance to ensure that reasonable conditions are enjoyed by those many seafarers from all nations around the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here in Australia, against the odds, we have developed some attitudes in this very difficult underworld of seafaring, shipowners and flags of convenience. I commend the member for Shortland, who has spent the last five to 10 years investigating this particular area. I think he has had a major effect on the attitudes of the major seafaring nations around the world 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in bringing some of these matters to their attention and, what is more, bringing a positive result because eventually only good ships will sail the high seas. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;On 2 June I moved that the House appoint a select committee to inquire into the sinking of HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> , Australia's greatest naval tragedy, in November 1941. Subsequently in that debate the honourable members for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) and Moore (Mr Filing) spoke, and, the honourable member for Moore having formally seconded my motion, the matter was in the normal course of events and in the usual way adjourned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Subsequent to that I placed a notice of motion on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> to at some stage move that so much of standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent me from moving to establish that forthwith. That caused some concentration of minds and some benevolent discussions and I am pleased to advise the House, as I undertook to the Chief Government Whip, the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), today, that I will not be proposing any precipitous action.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I see the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor) nodding appreciatively. I take that action because I have had discussions with the Chief Government Whip and discussions with the office of the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan) and I am absolutely persuaded and of the view that the minister is looking at this matter in good faith, as are a number of his colleagues and a number of members on all sides of the chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I indicated when I spoke on 2 June that the Minister for Defence had indicated publicly that he was not proposing to place any obstacles in the way of an inquiry of this nature. As I understand the minister, he is currently contemplating whether a more appropriate venue for this particular matter might be the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, in particular the Defence Subcommittee of that joint standing committee. When one looks at the range of matters that have been dealt with by select committees of the parliament since its inception, I remain of the view that a more appropriate vehicle is a select committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I know a poke in the eye with a burnt stick when I see one. If the minister is of the view that a reference to the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, in particular the Defence Subcommittee of that, is in his eyes a more appropriate vehicle and if it is that which requires the minister and the government to allocate time to enable this to be effected then I will gladly and gratefully thank the minister and the Chief Government Whip, who has been facilitating these discussions in the usual way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been asked by a number of colleagues since 2 June why I think it is appropriate that we deal with this matter now. I think there are three essential reasons. Firstly, the turn of the century and the Sydney Olympics gives us a focus on Sydney which may never arise again. There will be a focus on the name and I therefore think there is a chance to focus on Australia's greatest naval tragedy and the chance of finding the site of that tragedy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, there has never been a proper national or international documentation or archival search. Records perish, as do mem 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5202"> ories, but it is clearly the case when you examine the public comments that have been made by the Australian Archives and when you look at materials produced by the Western Australian Maritime Museum that there are gaps in the present archival and documentary record. If these gaps can be filled by the trawling through of the system by a parliamentary committee then that may lead to the third point: these days modern scientific techniques enable, with the use of that information, a search area to be narrowed and with significant advance in scientific and technological search for vessels on the seabed these days there is, in my view, a real prospect that towards the end of this century we could actually effect a proper search for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> and hopefully secure the finding of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I would like to thank the Chief Government Whip for the way he has been handling my representations in this matter. I remain hopeful that the Minister for Defence will, in the course of the next few days, be able to give me some positive advice. I let the House know clearly that I will, before the end of this session, move my notice of motion, if that is what it takes. I am confident it will not come to that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take the opportunity first of all to congratulate both the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) and the member for Moore (Mr Filing), who are, thankfully, in the chamber, for their initiatives on this subject. I think all three of us spoke on this a couple of years ago, in June 1995, at which time it was my pleasure to support what they were about. I would also like to assure both the member for Perth and the HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS>  Foundation Trust that the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan) will do everything within his powers to facilitate the inquiry that you are indicating.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where there is some question&mdash;and the member for Perth alluded to this in his comments&mdash;as to whether it should go through a select committee or whether it should go through the existing machinery, what I can say to you is that hopefully in the next few days we will be in a position to give you something more substantive. It needs to be 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> discussed in a little more detail on this side of the House. But, in so doing, I can assure you that whether it be within, as you indicated, the Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Committee of Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade or somewhere else will be given a full and free debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I stand here today not only as the member for Groom but also as somebody who, as most would know, served for a long time in the navy. During that time, I served with both Pat and Rory Burnett, now retired from the navy, who are the sons of Captain Joe Burnett who was lost in that tragedy in November 1941. I stand here both as a member of parliament and as somebody steeped in the naval tradition who would be keen to see the issues that would undoubtedly be raised finally put to rest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my speech in June 1995, I quoted from a book by Dr Tom Frame. Tom Frame, as both honourable members would know, was a serving naval officer at the time. In his book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">HMAS Sydney: Loss and Controversy</EMPHASIS>, he said in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the historical interest prompted by speculation over the loss of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS>  in the last decade has been productive in some respects and unproductive in others. The positive outcomes are principally archival . . . and researchers have had to examine areas of Australian naval history that had not been touched before, such as signal intelligence, convoy routing and gunnery fire control. The drawback is the preponderance of research and writing into one isolated area of history.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He then went on to talk about George Herman Gill's official history of the Royal Australian Navy which he says was `naturally constrained by the inherent editorial limits', some of which have been removed since 1995. He also went on to refer specifically to a couple of books such as one by Michael Montgomery and another by Barbara Winter. Of course, he was somewhat critical of both of those books at that particular time. The point I want to make is that he went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not helpful for history to be researched, written and then presented in the midst of a controversy, particularly when the history has contemporary consequences. The existence of motives that transcend academic interests, such as determination to blame an individual, can make it very difficult for the historian to write an objective history. When the historian is subject to these influences, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5203"> the history is likely to be polemical or even propagandist. This danger is underrated by both amateur and professional historians.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">While some would like to revisit this issue, others would want to let the matter rest. However, I can assure both the member for Moore and the member for Perth that in the next few days the Minister for Defence, after consultation with my colleagues on this side of the House, will make some specific proposals which I have every confidence both of you will agree with strongly.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I would also like to commend this motion to the House. I would also like to thank the member for Groom (Mr Taylor) for his contribution. We have a wide range of support across the board in this House for setting up an inquiry, but whether it is through a select committee or whether it is within the Joint Standing Committee of Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade is obviously going to be a matter for some negotiation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, to use the words of a former Labor member, whatever it takes to get this going is absolutely important. The member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) has made what I think is a most telling comment&mdash;as we have the Sydney Olympics coming up and we are fast approaching the centenary of Federation, this is an opportunity given to us to finally look into the circumstances surrounding the sinking of the HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> in what is recognised as Australia's greatest naval tragedy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the member for Groom pointed out, a range of people around the country have an interest in getting to the full facts behind the engagement between the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kormoran</EMPHASIS> in 1941. As the member for Perth has acknowledged, and as I mentioned the last time I spoke on this matter, an extraordinary number of documents are available not only within the archives but elsewhere.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last week in the Corio electorate, I met with chicken growers who are concerned at the adverse impact the importation of cooked chicken meat might have on their industry. In the Geelong region, there are around 53 growers who depend on this industry for their livelihood, and a further 200 who derive direct employment from the operation of Steggles chickens in the company's breeder farms, hatcheries and in their value added processing operations in Geelong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Each of the growers has a significant financial investment in their chicken farming operations. They are deeply concerned that the importation of cooked chicken meat from countries that already have Newcastle disease might devastate their flocks and their industry. Such an outbreak has the potential to destroy consumer confidence in their product&mdash;a confidence which has seen the per capita consumption of cooked chicken meat rise significantly in recent years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On behalf of these growers and their families, I ask the minister not to expose this industry to unacceptable risks associated with the deadly avian Newcastle disease. Chicken farmers in the Geelong region are calling on  the federal government to reject cooked chicken meat imports and to protect their future and that of their industry from this potentially devastating disease.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to rebut a Labor myth in relation to workplace agreements. Before the last election&mdash;and there have been examples since&mdash;the Labor Party  and the unions ran a scare campaign in relation to workplace agreements. This scare campaign was on the basis that it was a `sign or resign' case for workers, particularly the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5205"> young, females and casual employees&mdash;and this probably has something to do with flagging union membership they are trying to hype up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently in my electorate of Swan, a former manager of an East Victoria Park Supa Valu Supermarket was fined $800 by the Industrial Magistrates Court on two changes of threatening and intimidating two young workers into signing unsatisfactory workplace agreements. At the time of this event, the young workers were aged 16 and 17. The supermarket manager, a Mr Gordon Thorpe, was exposed publicly by one of the employees for threatening workers that, if they did not sign an agreement accepting less than the award rate, they would get no further work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This conviction expels the Labor/union myth that employees are less protected in the work force, particularly as it relates to workplace agreements. This conviction should also ram home the message to the unscrupulous employers that all workers&mdash;in particular, casuals, young people and women&mdash;are protected by the law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind the House that employees can use workplace agreements to secure a better deal in the workplace. However, this agreement cannot offer less than the award safety net.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last Saturday my wife, Jan, and I had the pleasure of celebrating with the Filipino community of western Sydney the 99th anniversary of the independence of the Philippines. The Philippines, like Australia, is a multiracial nation, where the people come from diverse backgrounds such as other parts of Asia, Europe and America.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1521, a Spanish fleet led by the navigator Ferdinand Magellan arrived in Cebu, one of the southern islands. However, it was only in 1565 that a Spanish settlement was successfully organised. Even today the Spanish influence permeates the arts, religion, architecture, cooking and fashion of the nation. Spanish domination ended in 1898 with the Spanish&hyphen;American war and the ill-fated Filipino revolution in 1896. In the euphoria following one victorious skirmish, the Filipino general leading the uprising declared that day&mdash;12 June 1898&mdash;as independence day for the Philippines.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lyn Barlin was appointed Clerk of the House of Representatives on 25 March 1991, having commenced service with the Australian Public Service in 1949. He transferred to the Department of the House of Representatives from the Treasury in August 1954. He became Sarjeant&hyphen;at&hyphen;Arms in March 1969, he was promoted to Clerk Assistant in January 1977 and in September 1982 he was promoted to Deputy Clerk of the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">May I say to the Clerk, through you, Mr Speaker, that on all occasions in the time that I have been a member of parliament&mdash;and that is a little over 23 years&mdash;I have not encountered in the service of the House of Representatives anybody whose innate courtesy, innate politeness and natural commitment to the institution of parliament exceeded that of Lyn Barlin. He was in every way a faithful, honest and intelligent servant of the institution of parliament. He gave honest and objective advice to me as Opposition Leader and, prior to that, in the various positions I held both in government and in opposition, and the same has obtained since the change of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think you could meet anybody in this life who is as naturally courteous and decent in his dealings with parliamentarians and his fellow workers in this building.

With Australia currently losing 3,000 to 4,000 jobs a month, when we need almost 15,000 a month just to hold the unemployment rate steady, just how much patience are the jobless and those fearful of losing their jobs supposed to have?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I might remark at the outset that they were infinitely patient with you, because after 13 years you gave us an average unemployment rate of 8.7 per cent. Let me repeat again that for 13 years you had the stewardship of the affairs of this country, and you left the incoming government with an average unemployment rate of 8.7 per cent. Let that be said again: an average unemployment rate of 8.7 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only did unemployment average 8.7 per cent whilst you were in government, but I say to the Leader of the Opposition that while he, in particular, was the employment minister he took it to a post-Depression high of 11.2 per cent. In other words, the man who sits opposite me, the man who asks the question, `Mr 11.2 per cent unemployment' himself, the man who presided over the highest level of post-Depression unemployment that Australia has ever seen&mdash;the man who was continuously, without interruption, a senior minister in a government that produced an average unemployment rate of 8.7 per cent&mdash;bumptiously demands that this government achieve in 15 months what you conspicuously failed to do after 13 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You ask me to acknowledge certain things. I will acknowledge quite a number of things. I will acknowledge, for example, that you left us with a deficit of $10.5 billion. You left us with an Australian economy that was less competitive than it ought to have been. You left us with a fiscal disgrace&mdash;a $10.5 billion deficit. Because of that, the measures taken by the new government have necessarily been directed towards getting the fundamentals of the Australian economy right. I am very 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> proud to say that after only three years we will have turned that $10.5 billion Beazley deficit into a surplus of $1.6 billion. In three years we will have turned it around completely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know the Leader of the Opposition does not like to be reminded of this, nor does he like to be reminded of the fact that he ran around during the election campaign telling the Australian people that we were in healthy surplus. He was aided and abetted by the former Prime Minister Mr Keating. They both deliberately and dishonestly misrepresented to the Australian community the true fiscal position of the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that the fundamentals of the Australian economy have strengthened considerably over the last 15 months. We have not only tackled the fiscal position; we have seen a very significant reduction in interest rates. One can only speculate where business confidence might be if the former government had remained in office and had continued the slack fiscal policy that it followed. If you had continued to follow the same fiscal policy, then, in fact, business confidence would have been significantly lower, unemployment would have been higher, the job prospects into next year would have been less. When you add all of those things together, it does remain the case that the fundamentals of the Australian economy are strengthening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Economic growth, according to the OECD, is projected at 3.5 per cent in 1997-98. It is higher than projected for the G7 average and the total OECD region. I know the Leader of the Opposition does not like to be told this. All he wants to do is to talk Australia down. All the Leader of the Opposition wants to do is to pretend to the rest of the world that our growth is less than the OECD. We have the lowest mortgage interest rate since the 1970s. The differential with US rates has fallen by 150 basis points since the election. There is a marked pick up in housing investment. Business investment is forecast to rise by 16 per cent in real terms in 1996-97 and eight per cent in real terms in 1997-98. Access Economics estimates $92 billion of possible probable and committed investment project&mdash;$92 billion of committed projects&mdash;yet the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5210"> Leader of the Opposition, with his doomsday talk, would have us believe that the Australian economy is in a state of ruin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are ahead of us many significant job creating measures: the $1 billion Federation Fund, commencing in 1998; the $1.25 billion Natural Heritage Trust, which the Labor Party did all it could to destroy&mdash;a fund and an investment that will generate jobs in rural and regional Australia; a $250 million regional telecommunications fund; major changes to the Workplace Relations Act&mdash;all of which were opposed by the Australian Labor Party&mdash;taxation reductions from 1 July; the $1 billion family tax package brought in, on time, without deduction in full on 1 January; the tax incentives for health insurance; and the capital gains tax changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said last week, I believe the fundamentals have strengthened and, as the benefits of the reforms introduced by the government flow through to the Australian economy, there will be a stronger and a brighter job outlook. I say again on behalf of the government that a man who gave us 11.2 per cent unemployment&mdash;a post-Depression high&mdash;who was a senior member of a government that averaged unemployment after 13 years of 8.7 per cent, is the last person in Australia to have the credentials to lecture anybody about unemployment.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

The number of young people in apprenticeships and traineeships this year will be at least some 10,000 over and above those in apprenticeships and traineeships in the previous year. School based apprenticeships and traineeships and other school to work programs which are helping young people make contact with employers while they are at school will go right to the roots of the disadvantages that young people face in the labour market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's national plan for literacy will address the basic skills of young people who are otherwise at risk of being long-term unemployed. The national training system is being greatly simplified to make sure that businesses can get the training that they want to be competitive. Some $500 million of public funding for training will be up for competition from 1 January next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the most significant reforms that the government is introducing to help unemployed people get jobs is the $2 billion contracting out of the employment placement services of the CES, which will be taking place over the next few months.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, what is your response to today's Reuters poll of 30 top market economists which states that last Thursday's job figures, showing 40,000 jobs lost in one month&mdash;23,000 of which were full time&mdash;`shocked the economic forecasting community'? Prime Minister, given Australia is now losing 3,000 to 4,000 jobs every month and we have the lowest male participation rate on record, when will you take urgent and decisive steps to turn around the loss of jobs rather than hiding behind smokescreens and sitting on your hands whilst unemployment queues grow?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My initial response is to remind the honourable member for Batman of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5212"> his complicity in the 8.7 per cent average unemployment rate that the Australian community had inflicted upon it under 13 years of your government. The man who asked me this question had a seat at the cabinet table that gave us 11.2 per cent unemployment. The man who asked me this question had a seat at  the table of the cabinet members who gave us an average rate of 8.7 per cent unemployment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My second response to the question asked by the honourable member is to remind him, to remind the House and to remind all people who study these things of the very positive outlook that the Australian economy apparently demonstrated in the latest OECD report. I remind the Australian parliament that we now have a very low level of inflation, and remind the honourable member for Batman that, since we have been in government, there have been reductions in interest rates of two per cent and, if your fiscal policy had been followed, those reductions would have been probably no more than a half or one per cent at the most with consequent adverse impacts for small business and for employment prospects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fundamentals of the Australian economy are extremely sound and as the value of reforms implemented by this government&mdash;not only in the fiscal area but also the reforms outlined by my colleague and the reforms implemented by the Minister for Industrial Relations&mdash;flow through, the jobs outlook in Australia will strengthen and become brighter.

In 1997, private business investment growth was the highest in the OECD with the exception of Iceland and Mexico; and in both 1997 and 1998 Australia's inflation, as measured by the GDP deflator, was well below the OECD averages&mdash;ours was 1.8 and 2.2, while the OECD's was 3.7 and 3.4. So we have a strong international economic outlook with Australia's amongst the best performances in the developed world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At this time not only will we have, by Australian standards, historically low interest rates, with home mortgage rates the lowest they have been since the 1960s, but we will also be kicking the Australian budget back into balance. There will be few, if any, developed nations in the world that can match 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5213"> the turnaround which this government will accomplish in its first term of office to deliver a surplus. In relation to employment, the OECD also notes that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Canada and Australia have introduced significant reforms more recently, though the results in unemployment reductions are not yet apparent. The experience of other countries shows that broad&hyphen;based policy action can durably reduce structural unemployment though it takes time. Far&hyphen;reaching reforms put in place in the 1980s in the UK, Ireland, the Netherlands and New Zealand have yielded significant improvements in labour market performance in all these countries with employment rising, unemployment rates falling or both.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So where do we see the government going? It is going into a surplus; reducing interest rates; growth amongst the best of any of the OECD nations; the best business investment of the G7; and labour market reforms going into place to make structural improvements in relation to unemployment. Now, where was the Labor Party? The Labor Party was opposed to balancing the budget and in favour of high interest rates. The Labor Party was opposed to labour market reform and for higher unemployment. The Labor Party wanted to put up wages and put more people out of work. The Labor Party was in the Industrial Relations Commission arguing for a wage increase to put people out of work. Don't forget that point: Labor wanted to put people out of work. Labor did everything it could to make sure that we could not reduce interest rates in this country, and Labor did everything it could to try to stop this government changing industrial relations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No wonder the Labor Party is sitting there thinking to itself, `What if all these things come off and the benefits start flowing? What is going to happen then?' Here was the Labor Party running around before the election saying, `We can't balance the budget. Let's hope we never win the election.' And you had the Leader of the Opposition running around saying, `It's balanced&mdash;but let's hope we never win the election.' Now what they are saying is, `After the Howard government has taken the hard decisions, let us try and sneak our way around and hope we can get back into office and take the advantage of it.' I say this to you: `You tried to stop every improvement and you will not get the benefit of them.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Accordingly, compensation arrangements need to recommend that fact. The Defence Force Discipline Act sets up differences between civilians and the ADF by having both ordinary disciplinary action and criminal disciplinary action for members who breach that act, where there is no equivalent in the civilian population.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Basically, the compensation arrangements acknowledge those differences, and they will be as follows. A separate stand&hyphen;alone scheme, which will be separate from the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act which governs compensation for public servants, will be worked upon. That recommendation was in the report and has been accepted by cabinet. But, in the interim, under the new payment system $200,000 will be paid to persons who are severely injured. The definition is paraplegia, quadriplegia or like injury with at least 80 per cent disability. In addition to the $200,000, there will be a payment of $50,000 for each dependent child. Similarly, where there is a death the widow or dependent person entitled will receive $200,000, and again there will be a separate payment of $50,000 for each dependent child. In addition to that, a $1,000 payment will be made available for financial advice, because at such times there is great concern about how best to take the benefits which are available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These changes will be made pursuant to the Defence Act, not the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act, to mark that distinct difference. In addition, we will seek permission from the tribunal to award bereavement pay so that pay is not cut off at the date of

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BT4">Dr KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Mitchell for his question. The House would be aware that Australia's immunisation rate for children nought to six years old at 53 per cent is one of the lowest in the world. Children who are not immunised are not the only ones at risk. They put at risk the lives of other children. There have been some 42 preventable child deaths from whooping cough and measles in the past 10 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The federal government is determined to change this situation and has developed a comprehensive strategy to address Australia's poor immunisation performance. The minister for health has presented his seven&hyphen;point plan, immunise Australia, that includes incentives for parents, a bigger role for general practitioners and the setting of targets. Schools have a role to play in the implementation of this plan and indeed schools have a key role to play in lifting the level of immunisation of children already in school. Parents who send their children to school have to be confident that their children are not at risk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the meeting of the education ministers in Darwin last week I put before the ministers a comprehensive strategy relating to immunisation at the school level. On Thursday last week, all the states and territories agreed to a set of measures to protect children in schools. The states without mandatory certification have undertaken to support the introduction of public health legislation covering mandatory certification by state health authorities. The 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5218"> states and territories have all agreed that certification requirements will be enforced and brought to the attention of principals and staff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All states have agreed to support school level education campaigns and allow for the use of school facilities to support immunisation. All states have agreed to cooperate  with public health campaigns designed to improve the level of the immunisation of children. I know that that will be good news for the  minister for health because the Commonwealth is very keen to see schools participate in catch up programs such as the campaign to eliminate measles as applied in United Kingdom.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Students who do not provide a certificate of their immunisation status under these decisions will not be permitted to enrol in school. The consequence of this is that Queensland, Tasmania, Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory will be moving to introduce new entry requirements to schools. It has been clear up to now that even where there are entry requirements these have not been enforced within the states. In Victoria, for example, schools failed to obtain certificates for some 14 per cent of students. In New South Wales a study conducted in 1996 reported that in one health region four out of 10 principals were unaware of their obligations. These are important decisions which will ensure that all Australian school children gain the benefits of the government's plan to lift immunisation levels in this country to over 90 per cent.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the fact that the member for Calare has asked me a question about native title issues. I will endeavour to respond directly to the question that he has asked me. My belief and the belief of the government is that the Wik decision handed down by the High Court of Australia, a decision in relation to the interaction of pastoral leases and native title, was a decision that came as a great surprise not only to the pastoralists of Australia but also to many of the leaders of the Aboriginal community of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would remind the honourable member, as he would know, of the words of the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating, regarding the impact of the grant of a pastoral lease on native title. I would remind him of the preamble to the existing Native Title Act. I would remind him of some of the words uttered on this subject and some of the assurances given by Aboriginal leaders, such as Mr Noel Pearson, during the debates in 1993 and in the several years that followed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The truth is that the Wik decision pushed the pendulum a long way away from the centre. The debate essentially was about what measures were necessary in order to bring it back into equilibrium. My argument that the 10&hyphen;point plan brings it back to equilibrium is based upon a number of propositions. The first of those is that our approach to native title fully respects the principles of native title enunciated in the original Mabo decision. I think that, if the honourable member were fair to the debate and not selective in the comments that he has made in his question, the honourable member would have acknowledged that the foundation of native title in this country is to be found in the decision of the High Court of Australia in the Mabo case, not in the decision of the High Court in the Wik case. It is in fact the principles of Mabo that are fully respected in the 10&hyphen;point plan. The honourable member can shake his head&mdash;</PARA>

What we have not been willing to do is to allow the element of insecurity and uncertainty which obtained as a consequence of the decision in the Wik case. We have not been content to allow that to remain, and that is why we have made the changes that we have made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member makes some reference to the Sultan of Brunei. That is presumably a reference to this quite erroneous claim that is going around Australia and that  is deliberately propagated by some people who either ought to know better or who are in complete ignorance of the fact that, in some way, the 10&hyphen;point plan allows mass freeholding without any contribution from people who get the benefit of that freeholding. That is not the case; it has never been the case and it never will be the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two principal elements involved in the approach to compensation and in the approach to payment. The first of them is that the cost of compensation involved, if there is a compulsory acquisition of native title, will be borne by the governments of Australia in the ratio of 75 per cent borne by the Commonwealth and 25 per cent borne by the states. The second element is this: if there is any upgrading of title as a consequence of the compulsory acquisition&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If there is any upgrading of that title then there will be a betterment charge imposed upon the person who receives the benefit of the upgrade. To reinforce that situation, we have made it clear, and in recent days I have made it clear in writing to the premiers and chief ministers of Australia, that if there is any upgrading of title following a compulsory acquisition of native title then a condition of the payment of the Commonwealth's 75 per cent will be the imposition of a betterment charge on the person who receives the benefit of the upgrade. So any suggestion that your sultan of Brunei or indeed anybody else is going to be 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> an unremunerating recipient of mass upgrades of title is completely erroneous.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point that I would remind the honourable member of, and those others in the community who are peddling this nonsense about mass freeholding or mass upgrading without charge, and being at a cost to the Australian taxpayer and not with the imposition of a betterment charge on people who get the benefit of the upgrade, is that it has always been possible under the Native Title Act for compulsory acquisition of native title to occur. This proposition that in some way the compulsory acquisition provisions of the native title proposed by us to be inserted in the Native Title Act are new is wrong. There have always been compulsory acquisition provisions.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MH4">Mr JULL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true that the consultants KPMG under Ken Baxter have reviewed the administration of entitlements with particular emphasis on enhancing accountability processes. One of the gratifying things about Mr Baxter's report was his early reference that he had investigated the situation of our claims and the overwhelming majority of senators and members were honest in their dealings in terms of their travelling allowance and in many cases in fact under or claimed on what they were entitled to. But KPMG also recommended that new systems be provided to provide effective internal audits, in&hyphen;built checks and balances and continuing peer pressure to maximise full disclosure and the integrity of the system. I should say that there still will be a responsibility on senators and members to make sure that they are diligent in terms of what they put in for their particular claims.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was proposed in the report, and the government has agreed, that there should be a consolidation of the payment system. At the moment, as you know, Mr Speaker, there can be four points from which claims can be made. This will be consolidated into one area in the Department of Administrative Services. That will cover the payment of remuneration and allowances. It will also enable the cross&hyphen;check of entitlement uses under the new equipment and the new programs that will be introduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When an irregularity in the use of entitlements is found a senior officer of my department will consult with the senator or member concerned and if he or she cannot provide an 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> adequate explanation the matter will then be referred to me to deal with in the first instance or whether or not I decide to give it to the Attorney-General for possible police involvement. Your department, Mr Speaker, and my department are working closely to make sure that the service to senators and members is not going to be diminished in any way at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has reinforced these measures because in future we will table in the parliament on a six monthly basis the expenditure details for all senators and members, including ministers and opposition officeholders, on all air and car transport and related travelling allowances. They will be audited within the department. They will be checked and double checked. This will enable a full reconciliation of the use of these entitlements and they will be there for full public scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is also going to make a further submission to the Remuneration Tribunal to tighten current entitlements to travel by formalising the government's policy on frequent flier points, by formalising the convention relating to ministerial travel allowances during an election period, and requiring parliamentarians to provide a report of the findings of their overseas study tours within four weeks of their return to Australia and for those to be tabled in the appropriate House.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also thank the honourable member for the excellent day that I had in her electorate last week. One of the points that comes up in talking to small business people is that it is very important to have a very simple and user&hyphen;friendly Workplace Relations Act. The reason for these technical changes is that, as the act has been in operation for a number of months, there are a number of refinements that we ought to make simply to make it easier. These changes are technical in the sense that all they do is merely ensure that the intentions of the Workplace Relations Act, as it was passed last year, are effected in a sensible manner.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been some who have said that the legislation enhances the powers of the Office of the Employment Advocate. The fact of the matter is that that is essentially not right. If anybody looks at the details, yes, we are proposing to extend the filing period from 14 days to 21 days for AWAs because they are finding that quite a lot are just missing the cut&hyphen;off date of 14 days. We also want to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5223"> provide the OEA with the capacity, where there is no disadvantage to the parties, to overcome and waive technical defects in the lodgment of AWAs. That has been a practical problem with dealing with the operation of the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lastly, obviously it will be a few months before this legislation is through. We have taken one sensible suggestion from the ACTU on board. We have also taken one from ACCI. If they have any other propositions in the meantime, we would be interested to hear them. I thank the honourable member for her question in relation to the technical bill.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0J4">Mr RUDDOCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Boothby for his question. I can assure him that the government is intent on creating jobs and boosting small business, particularly focusing on the immigration program in the area of encouraging people to settle away from the major population centres of Sydney and Melbourne. This is an area into which I have put a good deal of attention. Notwithstanding our unemployment difficulties, in some parts of Australia there are specific skill shortages, and we are looking at ways and means of ensuring that the maintenance of viable businesses is not hampered by the absence of skills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have been particularly anxious to enhance those parts of the immigration program that are able to work positively in this direction. Last financial year, we were able to put in place some specific initiatives. The first of these was the special regional linked category of migration, which enables sponsorship of skilled folk to come to Australia where they have family already living in designated areas. We had the regional sponsored migration scheme, which enables employers in regional Australia to nominate overseas personnel for permanent entry where they have been unable to recruit people locally. We have also enabled operation of the system, which has operated previously, where people living in regional Australia are able to get additional points if they are sponsoring a relative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further to that, there are a number of new initiatives which I think might be of interest to the member. We will be commencing on 1 July a new visa category which involves re 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5224"> gional established business in Australia. It will allow permanent residence for people who are in Australia on a long stay temporary business visa and who have a successful record of ownership and management of a business outside of a metropolitan area to be able to remain in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The benefits of business migration are very substantial. It has brought considerable investment to Australia&mdash;we know that the average business migrant employs 4.5 people within two years of arrival&mdash;and it brings a range of business and entrepreneurial skills which will help grow Australia. We do have some other initiatives which we are looking at. One of them involves bonus points for students who  may have studied in a regional centre. We are also looking at territory sponsorship of independent applicants as a way of assisting in getting a better dispersal of the migration outcome.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Longman for his question, because I should inform the House that Defence officials have just completed a highly successful series of strategic talks in Beijing. During the Prime Minister's visit to China in March, Mr Howard and President Jiang Zemin agreed

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result, this conference took place last week, and it was the first formal dialogue at a high level between the two defence organisations. The Australian defence team was headed by the Vice Chief of the Defence Force, Vice Admiral Chris Barrie, and included Deputy Secretary, Strategy and Intelligence, Mr Hugh White.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were two outcomes which the House should understand. First, there was a detailed discussion of alliances. The Chinese delegation said that they fully understand and accept the nature of the Australia&hyphen;United States relationship. They also said that, while  our approaches were not identical, in no sense were they incompatible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, we agreed on a substantial increase in defence contact over the next year or so, including visits to China by the Secretary to the Department of Defence and Service Chiefs and a ship visit. The Chinese Chief of the Defence Force accepted an invitation to visit Australia, and we are looking at defence ministerial visits as soon as they are practicable, both ways.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As well as that, the deputy Chief of General Staff of the People's Liberation Army will come to Australia next year for return talks. Despite the very silly remarks made by the Leader of the Opposition that were reported in the press this morning, the tenor of his remarks is entirely wrong. His remarks were about our handling of the enhanced defence ties with the United States. This program with China is the most substantial level of defence contact with Beijing since the normalisation of diplomatic relations in 1972. It shows the importance that we put on developing a very effective security dialogue with China, and we will continue to do so.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

The AMT specifically targets partnerships. In the rural industry, nearly 80 per cent of all dairy and broadacre farms are run as partnerships. Targeting disadvantaged groups such as rural students, will not increase the participation rates of these students, but act as another disincentive in their pursuit of education. As the bulk of students at Orange Agricultural College are from rural areas and farms such as mentioned above, the targeting of them can only be seen as adding to the rural crisis and in effect placing them at greater disadvantage.</PARA>

The University cannot support the amount of service that is vital for an appropriate education with the proposed funding.

Financial support available to them is lacking, due to the current plight of the rural crisis. It is vital for people in agriculture and related industries to seek further education using the skills and knowledge acquired to remain competitive. Without the removal of these policies, there will be an inevitable loss of human capital at the institution and industry, with staff leaving, attracted to higher income in the private sector and students who are no longer able to afford to increase their skills and knowledge by undertaking study.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">I am not some starry&hyphen;eyed idealist who believes that everyone who enters a small business should be indemnified from the realities of commercial decisions nor protected from the vagaries of the marketplace. Equally, I am not going to stand by and allow so-called business entrepreneurs to sell marketing systems, whether they be franchises or otherwise, with scant regard for the purchaser or, even worse, with the deliberate intent of deceiving the purchaser.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That said, I want to talk today about franchises. We are told that at the last definitive survey there were 555 franchise systems and 25,000 franchises in Australia turning over $42.7 billion and employing 279,000 people. It is obviously a significant part of the Australian business sector providing substantial contribution to the livelihoods of many  small businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some marvellous franchises in Australia&mdash;some imported, some locally devised. In the food sector they provide, in many instances, standards of best practice, quality control, cleanliness and presentation.  I am the last to criticise those who meet these criteria. Sadly, there are other franchises which are a conduit for non-performance, deception, unfulfilled promises and outright fraud.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of my constituents, Ashleigh Steel, had a Stockmans Australian Cafe. Stockmans is a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5232"> hot food franchise which attempts a distinctively Australian feel. Before going into the Stockmans franchise, Mr Steel spent 16 years on fishing trawlers building up some equity. He bought a fish and chip shop which he ran with his wife. At the time he sold his business to enter the franchise operation he owed a mere $40,000 on his house and had $80,000 in cash. He signed an agreement and took over the franchise in March 1993. He told me that soon after taking over the franchise he realised he had been duped. The shop was not going as well as he was promised; the franchisor was not fulfilling even the minor contractual obligations; and he was not given marketing or training support. He was not in the business he had been sold.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, like any other small business operator, he believed that with hard work and perseverance he could turn it around. By the time Stockmans had finished with him a few months ago the bank had taken away his home, he had been through a number of legal actions and had virtually lost everything. He poured many thousands of dollars into the business in the hope that he could revive it. He worked longer and longer hours in the business thinking it would turn around, trying to make it work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No shirker of hard work, Ashleigh Steel is fruit picking now and trying to rebuild his life. The Steel case is not a unique one. I met four other couples who between them owned three Stockmans stores, and they were all in a similar situation. They had all lost their houses, been through legal action, lost everything and were in debt. All of them are working again. One is a taxi driver, one is selling real estate on commission and the others have taken clerical positions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These people and others like them need to be protected against exploitative franchisors like Stockmans Australian Cafe Holdings Ltd. They need to be protected against directors like Paul Kilgour McVerry of Ashgrove, Peter George James of Birkdale and Francis William Bennett of Runaway Bay&mdash;all of Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a document dated July 1996, there were 19 Stockmans franchises around Australia that were listed and three that were not listed. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> These included: Australia Fair, Bundaberg, Mackay, Capalaba in Brisbane, Dubbo, Geelong, Indooroopilly, Ipswich, Kawana on the Sunshine Coast, Liverpool, Miranda in Sydney, Mount Pleasant in Mackay, Pacific Fair, Strathpine, Sugarland in Bundaberg, Tamworth, Toombul, Townsville, Yeppoon, Nerang, Runaway Bay and Fountain Gate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the time of my research, of these 22 stores, seven no longer existed&mdash;they had gone bust&mdash;seven were reportedly not doing well, and the rest were sort of okay or had been bought by a master franchisor. But if 14 out of 22 franchises are not doing well or no longer exist, that is not a good strike rate and the alarm bells should be ringing. This, in combination with other practices of the company, provides the strongest argument against self-regulation. I regret being at odds with the minister on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ashleigh Steel tells me he lost something like $300,000 in the franchise venture with Stockmans. Others that I spoke to lost similar or greater amounts. If you take the closed stores&mdash;those that have previously been churned and, say, half of those struggling at present&mdash;you arrive at a figure of between $3 million and $4 million lost by small business operators through the Stockmans franchise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us not assume that any of the franchisees, former or present, are poor managers, foolish, naive or whatever&mdash;tags which have been placed on them by the Stockmans management. Many of them, if not all of them, had extensive backgrounds in business and wanted to have a go at providing for their own futures. When Ashleigh Steel bought the Bundaberg Stockmans, he wanted to make sure he could pay for his children's university education. Maurice Reick bought the Strathpine Stockmans looking to fund his wife's and his own retirement. The Vandermeers and Golinskies bought the Strathpine store as they were looking for an investment, and Gil  Banks bought the Australia Fair store as he was looking for jobs for his kids.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of them went in with their eyes open, but the directors managed to hide all relevant information or give them inflated, blatantly wrong information in order to sell the franchises. Even when there was a franchising 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5233"> code of practice, the directors of Stockmans failed to disclose relevant information concerning these franchises. The disclosure document was principally to help inform potential franchisees of the franchisor's legal and financial position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Stockmans directors did not disclose vital information, such as legal action against the company and its directors. Stockmans directors did not disclose how other franchisees had finalised their franchise agreements, and the directors did not disclose relevant interests in related companies&mdash;all of which were required as disclosure under the franchising code of practice. To put it succinctly, the directors misled Ashleigh Steel about there not being any legal action, when there was legal action pending by a franchisee in the Toowoomba Stockmans against the Stockmans directors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The directors were untruthful to Julie Vandermeer and Fimke Golinskie about the former franchisee of Strathpine, Maurice Reick, and his ability to run the store. The directors were untruthful about how he left the franchise. The directors misled Gil Banks when he bought the Australia Fair store. They lied about customer traffic through the centre, and they inflated the projected weekly turnover, overstating the store's ability by around $2,000 a week. Not only did the directors mislead about the capabilities of the business to the franchisees; they also misled lawyers, accountants and business advisers too.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Gil Banks bought the Australia Fair store, he negotiated the deal through a business broker. The broker would ask questions. Paul McVerry would come back with half-truths&mdash;like the one where the Australia Fair shopping complex had 220,000 people through the centre weekly. Yes, there was a lot of traffic through the centre, but nowhere near the Stockmans franchise. Even before the code of practice was removed last year, this company, Stockmans Australian Cafe Holdings Ltd, was flouting the rules and systematically misleading franchisees to entice them to buy a franchise. Self-regulation of the industry is not an option when people like McVerry, James and Bennett are working the system.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to assume that the directors were deliberate in their intent. It would be obvious when one business failed consistently over a 12&hyphen;month period, or a succession of franchisees failed in the one store, that there was something fundamentally wrong with the site, the method or the marketing. It is even less excusable when one of the directors, Paul Kilgour McVerry, was a director of P&amp;A Marketing Services for the past 12 years. Would you not think that running a marketing company he would have been able to offer some assistance?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The directors of Stockmans&mdash;McVerry, James and Bennett&mdash;did not ask. They did not change a thing. They said it was bad management on the part of the franchisees. The directors would find some unsuspecting investor, put them in the same store with the same pitiful support and the same poor training, and then watch them fail too.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In short, the directors were practising churning. In some cases, three operators went through the one franchise business. When the franchisees asked for help, they were told that they were bad managers and that they had to work harder. Interestingly, none of the franchisees I spoke to had ever failed in a business before, yet 14 out of 22 Stockmans franchises are either closed or experiencing difficulty. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What we have just heard in this motion and in the contribution made by the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Neville) is a clear demonstration as to why the recommendations contained in the fair trading inquiry report, tabled in this parliament two weeks ago, should be put in place. I have to say to the honourable member that I am absolutely delighted that the member for Petrie (Ms Gambaro) is in the House today, because she  was a member of that committee that carried out very extensive examinations right around Australia and listened to the concerns of franchisees as they told similar sorts of stories to those that we have just heard from the member for Hinkler in respect of his constituents and others in Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5234">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find it rather extraordinary that, in the last three weeks since this particular matter and more broadly the issue of the fair trading inquiry report have been before the parliament&mdash;when there have been matters of public importance for debate and now that this issue been brought on by my friend the member for Hinkler&mdash;none of the members of the committee on the government's side who reported in an unanimous report making recommendations about Commonwealth government involvement in franchising spoke to support the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser) when we sought some explanations from him during those debates. So I am very pleased the member for Petrie is in here today to support her coalition colleague on this important issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that recommendation 3.3 contained in the parliamentary committee report that I referred to&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Finding a balance: towards fair trading in Australia</EMPHASIS>&mdash;is the one which should be enacted. I hope that both the member for Hinkler and the member for Petrie can do a little better than the minister did in question time today and has been able to do in the last couple of weeks when responding to concerns expressed by people in the retailing industry and by franchisees out there in broad Australia&mdash;the small business community that this minister constantly maintains that he supports. Recommendation 3.3 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth enact specific franchising legislation providing for compulsory registration of franchisors and compliance with codes of practice.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .       . . .      . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation should provide for adequate disclosure documentation, the establishment of appropriate independent code administration bodies, and dispute resolution procedures funded through compulsory registration fees.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Dead right! I am sure the member for Petrie is going to speak in support of that, as she certainly did when she appended her name to this committee report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sad thing is that, whilst the member for Hinkler can talk about Stockmans and his constituents who have been disadvantaged by 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the present legislation and lack of legislation for franchising and for franchisors, the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs seems not to want to take any action about it, because in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> of 31 May, some three days after this committee report was tabled in this place, the minister rejected calls by a parliamentary committee of inquiry for legislation to regulate the franchise sector. Yet he stood up in this place today and said, `It is a government decision and we have not made any decisions yet as far as this whole committee's recommendations are concerned.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find that a touch odd. Here is the minister giving an interview where he said that an industry code of conduct would be the best way to resolve disputes between franchisors and their franchise operators, he said that he was not attracted to legislative underpinning of any of those codes and he ruled out in that interview taking forward the recommendations of this committee's report. Yet he stood up in this place this afternoon and said anything but that. He stood up in this place this afternoon&mdash;albeit talking about retail tenancy, but more generally, as did the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), about where this report was going to go&mdash;and told us all, `The government will make a decision in time and we will respond when we get around to it.' Yet the minister has ruled it out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not sure why this happened&mdash;it is just a conjunction of events, it would seem&mdash;but in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> today there is a very thorough article by David Forman under the headline `Prosser's molehill turns into a mountain'. It goes on to talk about problems in the franchising industry and how the minister himself has made a rod for his own back by cutting funding to the Franchise Code Administration Council&mdash;a decision taken in last year's budget to cut funding for the very sort of council that he maintains is better  equipped to deal with issues arising in disputes between franchisors and franchisees. He cut the funding for it and, based on legal advice, based on accountancy advice, that council folded in January this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there is not even an informal body to deal with dispute resolution problems arising 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5235"> between franchisees and franchisors or, more generally, about that whole issue. As we know, this is the very sort of mechanism that the minister for small business trumpets in this place and maintains is the best possible solution to the problem. It is interesting to read that this particular article by Mr Forman goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Adding to his embarrassment&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is the embarrassment of the minister for small business&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is the fact that a government&hyphen;dominated parliamentary committee has sided with those opposing him&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that, I presume, means us on this side of the parliament&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">rejecting his preferred option for the franchising industry after a 10-month inquiry. Instead, it has produced a series of recommendations that in effect endorse the Labor Party's approach to the issue.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Well, dead right. Once again it is the Labor Party showing the way how this very delicate issue of franchising and franchisors should be tackled. This article goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is difficult to see how Mr Prosser can now extricate himself from the imbroglio without attracting further public attack or performing a highly embarrassing backflip.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I would say double backflip with pike on this particular issue, because he has already done that today. He has told this parliament that no decision will be made by this government without thorough review and it will be up to the government and, if it happens to conflict with his very extensive real estate interests as a retailer, then it will be passed to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to remind the House that our good friend and colleague the minister for small business is also a franchisee himself. He retails petrol in Bunbury and, therefore, is a franchisee. So not only have we got the minister very publicly in articles putting forward his views that he is opposed to having, as the committee recommended, Commonwealth legislation to underpin franchising codes of conduct and codes of practice&mdash;yet that is exactly what he as a franchisee might get some benefit from&mdash;but also we know from his registration of members' interests that the minister is a major 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> landlord having `various lots Bunbury', which, I think, means lots of Bunbury.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This clearly demonstrates that there is this conflict of interest between him as the minister making policy decisions and taking those policy decisions forward to the government and to the cabinet for decision and deliberation and at the same time his being both a landlord and a franchisee. There is a clear conflict of interest here. This is an issue which we have pointed out today, and will continue to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me conclude where I started, and that is to say to my colleague the member for Hinkler that to bring forward his particular concerns about the franchising industry is very appropriate at the moment and the conjunction of timing on this was most fortuitous. But the answer lies, my friend, not in what the minister has obviously gone out very publicly and said but in the particular recommendations contained in this report. I hope that within your caucus you will support those recommendations. The member for Petrie will; she is going to be a great voice and she will give you every bit of support. We will hear from her in a moment and get that support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My friend the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Mr Ronaldson), who is at the table, knows what it is about in regional Australia. He would support those recommendations as well. It is time you took your minister in hand and said, `If you have got these conflicts and if you cannot live with these recommendations, get out of the kitchen if you cannot stand the heat.' Put someone in the job who will do the job properly. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to support the motion on the franchising industry put forward by the member for Hinkler (Mr Neville). I would like to thank the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) in his speech for his unqualified endorsement of a number of points.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Three years ago I was the Queensland marketing manager for the Franchisors Association of Australia and New Zealand. I have 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5236"> experienced franchising from both sides, from the franchisor's perspective and from the franchisee's viewpoint. I worked for, and I was accountable to, a board of some of the most reputable and largest franchisors in the country. Groups such as Eagle Boys Dial&hyphen;A&hyphen;Pizza, the Poultry Shop, Crystal Softdrinks and Bumpa&hyphen;To&hyphen;Bumpa were just a few of the ones that I want to mention today. The Franchising Code Administration Council was in existence at that time. It had been established in early 1993 with funding from the Department of Industry, Science and Technology. The name later changed in 1996 to the Franchising Code Council. That council was made up of franchisors, franchisees and legal and service representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The industry got right behind that code council and we attempted to support it wholeheartedly. At the time, self-regulation was the way to go. The code at that time covered some very important areas, such as the financial requirements by franchisors of franchisees and particulars of franchise systems. It went into franchisor business experience and key financial information as well as disclosure of documents and information, cooling&hyphen;off periods, the number of franchises terminated or not renewed over the past year by the franchisor and also litigation that former franchisees were undertaking with current franchisors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The council ceased to operate in December 1996. At this time only 65 per cent of franchisors belonged to the code. The member for Cunningham spoke today about funding cuts. The government maintained funding at this time. The council was always meant to be self&hyphen;regulatory in the future, and funding was certainly not the reason for its demise. Internal management issues were the reasons that the code council failed, and the main problem was its lack of effectiveness. Why was it ineffective? It was unable to inform the marketplace of those franchisors who were removed from the register for non&hyphen;compliance and the council feared defamation proceedings. That is why it folded, not because of funding cuts, as was mentioned by the member for Cunningham.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The code is a good code. It has always been a good code. The only problem with it, though, is that there have not been enough or sufficient penalties to remove franchisors who breach the standards of conduct provision in the code. The Trade Practices Act does not have a strong or effective provision when dealing with unconscionable conduct. There needs to be more substantial information and stronger disclosure provisions for it to work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Aggrieved franchisees have no effective legal remedy, and the member for Hinkler has spoken to us today at some great length about that. He spoke of his experience with the Stockman's Australian Cafe chain. I must say that I also met with some of these franchisees, and I was very impressed with their business acumen. They had certainly had successful businesses before they went into this franchise group. Many of the franchisees he spoke of today have lost much financially as well as having suffered emotionally. The effects do not just exist in the pocket. They also cause stress and worry to family, friends and colleagues, and effective mediation processes are essential to ensure that franchising works. Effective underpinning of the Trade Practices Act must occur. There are franchisors who have been complying with the code and always have been. These franchisors&mdash;and I have spoken to a number of them&mdash;would not have a problem if a mandatory code were introduced. Why should ethical franchisors be penalised because a few do not do the right thing?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My time at the association showed me that franchising is very different in many ways from taking up or purchasing a normal type business. Firstly, the franchisor derives income from an initial franchise fee without having to provide additional capital or directly manage the franchise. Franchisees also gain from the benefits of access to an established business system, developed products, services, training, promotion, business advice and  group advertising. However, there is a perception out there that franchising is a lower risk venture than a normal type business, and many are certainly attracted to franchising. I would cautiously recommend that they seek legal or accounting advice before committing 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5237"> large sums of money to any business, not just franchising. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ian Blackburne, the managing director of Ampol, has written to us recently complaining about the plan by Labor and dealer associations to amend legislation to allow franchisees to buy fuel from any terminal. He further complains that the government may find repeal of the petroleum franchising legislation too difficult. He complains that Labor is campaigning against this, on the basis that it will cost jobs in petrol retailing. But he then says, `The whole purpose of competition reform is to reduce inefficiency' and that `it is not possible to have both lower prices and service station jobs created by inefficiency. A choice has to be made.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Make no mistake. Everyone in the petrol retailing industry&mdash;particularly people in country towns&mdash;needs to understand that the big oil companies want to get rid of petrol retailing jobs, notwithstanding our disgraceful 8.8 per cent unemployment rate, and they want the government to repeal the petrol sites and petrol franchisees acts so that they can do it. But will they really give us lower prices if we let them slash jobs in petrol retailing? Take a look at the fine print. Dr Blackburne's May speech says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian companies averaged only an 8% return on assets before interest and tax over the past 5 years, well below the rate that is acceptable to shareholders.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In other words, the big oil companies think they are not making enough money! And when Labor puts forward a proposal for open access to terminals, a proposal which really would lower petrol prices, Ampol screams blue murder. They mutter darkly about `backdoor nationalisation' when what we are really trying to achieve is fair dinkum competition&mdash;not an industry run by cartels and price fixing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say that it is not just the Labor Party which sees the need for legislative protection for franchisees. Both government and opposition members, in the fair trading 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> report, expressly investigated franchising in the petroleum distribution industry. They noted the specific regulatory action taken in the United States and recommended&mdash;and the oil companies and the government need to take note of this&mdash;that the Petroleum Retail Marketing Franchise Act should remain in force until new franchising legislation is enacted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They further recommended specific franchising legislation&mdash;which would include the oil industry&mdash;providing for adequate disclosure documentation, the establishment of independent code administration bodies and dispute resolution procedures funded through compulsory registration fees. They are right and the oil companies are wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for how wrong they are, I recently had the owner of the Shell roadhouse at High Street in Heathcote come to see me. He bought the business for $275,000 in 1989. He has invested a lot of money in it since then and yet the last offer he got for it was $165,000. Franchisees beware.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Andree&hyphen;Jansz had a dispute with Shell's supplier to him, Tierney Petroleum, concerning malfunctioning tanks and malfunctioning pumps, particularly after a new underground fuel tank was installed by Tierney Petroleum in 1993. Mr Andree&hyphen;Jansz was, and remains, alarmed by the fact that the tanks were put in on his land without obtaining council, EPA or CFA approval, as required by regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How did Tierney Petroleum address this dispute? They took the bowsers from his roadhouse in November last year, entering his property without approval to do so. This of course made it impossible for him to carry on the dispute; to do so would have destroyed his business entirely. This disgraceful treatment of Mr Andree&hyphen;Jansz is one of the reasons we need to not only maintain but also improve the legal rights of franchisees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How do Shell and Ampol explain why petrol at Heathcote is regularly 6c to 7c per litre dearer than petrol at Tooborac&mdash;which is only 15 minutes closer to Melbourne&mdash;or why LPG is 33.9c per litre at Heathcote, yet only 22.9c per litre at Kilmore? Mr Andree&hyphen;Jansz 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5238"> tells me that Tierney Petroleum recommends to the franchisee at his roadhouse the price at which petrol is to be sold.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is Labor's plan for genuinely open access to petrol wholesalers and implementation of the recommendations of the fair trading inquiry&mdash;supported as they are by representative business organisations such as the Motor Trades Association of Australia and the Pharmacy Guild of Australia&mdash;which will reduce country petrol prices and give petrol franchisees the protections they both need and deserve.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Today, I wish to warn the House and the Australian community of a silent plague that is amongst us: a plague that could affect many Australians&mdash;a plague that in fact kills. It is a plague which most of us have heard about, yet have not considered its importance; a plague which has affected over 500 million people worldwide; a plague which is known to affect 150,000 to 200,000 Australians, yet there remains little understanding of the disease. In fact, this figure could be very much underestimated, as this disease could affect more than four times that number&mdash; 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">reaching almost a staggering one million Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a plague which receives little or no funding compared with other deadly diseases, like HIV; a plague that  you or I, our children, friends, relatives or co&hyphen;workers can easily contract if we are not careful with simple tasks in our lives and do not take necessary precautions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am talking of the virus hepatitis C. Hepatitis C is a disease which is amongst us; a disease which is a blood&hyphen;borne viral infection having serious long&hyphen;term health consequences. Hepatitis C can affect anyone. If contracted, it can lead to chronic fatigue and an inability to work or perform other duties, right through to serious liver failure requiring liver transplantation. Hepatitis C could also lead to primary liver cancer, which is a terminal condition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Hepatitis C has been around for a long time but under very different names. However, it was not until the late 1980s or very early 1990s that the medical community was able to clearly identify the condition now called hepatitis C. Hepatitis C research can largely be thankful for the work done within the HIV research, allowing for an identification of what it is all about. The irony of this is that there are more hepatitis C sufferers in the community than there are HIV&hyphen;AIDS patients. Yet the funding programs for hepatitis C are clearly inadequate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Hepatitis C is a serious condition. It is in our community and many may be suffering from it unaware of the risk to them and those around them. As I previously said, hepatitis C is a blood&hyphen;borne disease; therefore, anyone dealing with blood is at risk. Of course, there are high risk groups. Fifty to 60 per cent of people diagnosed with hepatitis C are injecting drug users. However, hepatitis C can pervade many walks of life through our normal daily habits&mdash;it can be transmitted by simple things like sharing a razor or toothbrush.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australians who received blood before 1990 could also be at risk. The reason? There were no clear screening mechanisms for it prior to that year. In fact, I have spoken to several  
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5239"> sufferers of the disease who contracted it through this very procedure. The fact is there could be many within our community who are carriers of hepatitis C and yet do not know that it is part of them. This is why I have moved this motion in the House today. It is time the community was made fully aware of the hepatitis C condition and how it could be impacting upon the community. It is time we addressed hepatitis C more fully and applied some procedures at a general practitioner level. It is also time we allowed more funds to help research into hepatitis C. It is also time we established greater funding to help organisations such as the Hepatitis C Council educate those with the condition and the broader community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A prime example of what can be done when addressing a serious disease within our community is the National AIDS Council. HIV&hyphen;AIDS remains a serious concern within our community. However, it is not the only disease which threatens us through blood transmissions. Hepatitis C is also a very serious condition, yet it is totally inadequately funded in comparison with the excellent HIV programs. I seek no reduction in funding of the HIV programs. However, it is vital we do not concentrate on this condition at the expense of others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that medical research funding can at times be quite scant for a lot of researchers, and those researchers who are lucky enough to apply their great skills to solving medical mysteries can be very precious about holding onto their funds. But when the community is at threat it is not the time to play politics with funds. Rather, it is a time to reappraise and identify what our priorities really are. Hepatitis C is a priority and I defy anyone to claim that it is not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This motion seeks to bring to the attention of the House and the community the need to protect hepatitis C sufferers against discrimination; the need for access to legal services when discrimination occurs; the need for appropriate and consistent pre&hyphen; and post&hyphen;hepatitis C test information; the need for counselling, support, medical and dietary advice and other services for hepatitis C patients within their local area; and the need 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> for access to well&hyphen;educated GPs and other health care workers who can assist hepatitis C patients in understanding their condition and their requirements for the management of their condition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But this motion asks for even more. It also asks for hepatitis C information on a wide range of topics which is consistent, up to date and easy to access in a variety of printed and other formats; access to an adequately funded Hepatitis C Council in each state or territory to gain information and support from other people who have the condition; a supportive social environment which allows choices for hepatitis C patients about their health and lives; strategies to promote health monitoring and maintenance; access to affordable hepatitis C treatments; access to suitably trained hepatitis C counsellors; research into hepatitis C which identifies more effective treatments, including research into contemporary therapies; and access to suitable housing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Almost one per cent of the population of Australia suffers from hepatitis C, compared with 0.4 per cent of the population suffering from HIV. However, funding for hepatitis C research is nowhere near the level of HIV funding research. As an example, it is almost impossible to find out about specific funding for hep C programs in this country because there is no relevant data. Some $52 million is spent each year on HIV, which encompasses hep C needs. However, my advice is that only $200,000 is currently being spent on research programs for hepatitis C. I am also advised that little, if any, is being spent on education programs. As I said previously, I am not advocating a cut in HIV funding for research, but as there is a notable decrease in the incidence of HIV in Australia and an increase in the incidence of hepatitis C, we must look at where the medical dollars are going and seek out our priorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today I am calling for a national strategy to deal with the problem of hepatitis C. For  instance, in my own state of Western Australia I have met with the Hepatitis C Council and they are aiming for this objective. However, funding is their greatest concern. Where are the priorities within our community when we cannot adequately fund programs which 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5240"> could reduce the incidence of such a serious plague amongst us? As legislators, we must recognise that national strategies can make inroads into the spreading of this particular disease.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When people are first diagnosed with hepatitis C they usually are shocked and sometimes suffer from trauma. Generally their doctor is not fully aware of the need for adequate counselling. It is not the doctors' fault; it is just that the information has not been adequately disseminated throughout the medical profession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will read one case from the National Hepatitis Council's education reference group booklet which may give a greater understanding of the problems faced by hepatitis C patients It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was very apprehensive not knowing the prognosis, and because doctors dismiss it so lightly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Even today they refer to the symptoms as very minor and vague.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They are not minor to a person with hepatitis C.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In fact they are devastating.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was angry with the doctor.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amount of quality information that I'd been given was not good.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I'd been led to believe that it might go away.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I didn't get as much information as I wanted.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is from `Tom', in Canberra, Australian Capital Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today's motion aims, if anything, to alert people to the fact that hepatitis C is a very serious disease in Australia. No&hyphen;one is immune from it. I am not raising this issue to scare anyone, but there could be people within our community who have hepatitis C without knowing it and pass it on to other innocent people. If someone has a simple skin abrasion or even a cut that comes into contact with a hep C sufferer, it may mean that they contract the disease. There is a risk that a carrier may innocently pass it on. This is why we need an education program&mdash;an education program that addresses the causes, the symptoms, the risks and the potential to contract hepatitis C. We need a nationwide education program. It is vital and urgent.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember that when HIV&hyphen;AIDS first came to the community's focus a lot of misinformation was spread amongst the community. The community was not fully informed about the disease or who was at risk. That led to much fearful prejudice and intolerance. However, it ultimately led to a highly respected program which has worldwide recognition. I would not condone such hysteria towards hepatitis C patients. However, it is imperative we get the message out into the community. Hepatitis C is amongst us and we must act. Hepatitis C sufferers deserve better than what is offered now. For the sake of our community, given the threat of hepatitis C, I commend the motion to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) is to be congratulated for initiating this debate on hepatitis C. I do not believe he has moved far enough in sponsoring this motion, but nevertheless he is to be congratulated for it. He says that there should not be a cut in funding for HIV&hyphen;AIDS, and in real terms there has been, but I will talk about that in a minute.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He is certainly right in saying that hepatitis C is an urgent public health concern in Australia. In an address to the Australian Institute of Political Science in August 1996, six months after the government was elected, the Minister for Health and Family Services, Dr Wooldridge, acknowledged the former Labor government's status in the international community as a world leader in developing effective responses to HIV and AIDS. This is because the previous Labor government's strategy was one of harm minimisation rather than the head in the sand approach that is favoured by members of the Lyons Forum or the emu brigade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The acute infection of hepatitis C is asymptomatic in most cases so that, as in HIV&hyphen;AIDS cases, it is very difficult to obtain reliable incidence rates. According to the World 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5241"> Health Organisation, in the order of three per cent of the world's population has been infected by hepatitis C, which was only discovered in 1989. As many as 80 per cent of affected people become chronically infected and risk liver cancer and cirrhosis of the liver. This places hepatitis C amongst the pathogens of primary concern to human health and amongst the known infectious causes of cancer. Hepatitis C has been described by the MJA as the commonest life threatening infection in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Cowan is to be congratulated on taking this initiative. However, I do not believe it goes far enough. The problem with the motion before the House today is that essentially it goes to the treatment of currently diagnosed patients and money for screening and assessment programs, but it avoids the most important part of a hepatitis C strategy, as was the case with HIV&hyphen;AIDS, which is prevention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The World Health Organisation has targeted prevention as paramount to developing any effective strategy to deal with the hepatitis C epidemic. The World Health Organisation notes that treatment is currently effective in only approximately 20 per cent of cases and is too expensive for approximately 90 per cent of diagnosed patients. Worldwide there are more than 170 million chronic carriers who are at risk of developing liver cirrhosis and/or liver cancer. Hepatitis C has been described by the chief of gastroenterology and hepatology at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Washington DC as an `iceberg like disease: for every one person who has clinical evidence of disease, there are probably 10 or 20 who do not have knowledge or have any indication that they are infected'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the major causes of transmission of hepatitis C is injected drug use, because it appears to be primarily a blood borne disease. While there has been substantial success in harm minimisation strategies in controlling the HIV&hyphen;AIDS epidemic amongst injecting drug users, this is not necessarily the case with hepatitis C. It appears that only minimal breaches of HIV&hyphen;AIDS infection control guidelines can result in transmission of the hepatitis C virus. Therefore, we need to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ensure that every drug user in this country has access to clean needles to ensure that these control guidelines are not breached.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us not repeat the errors of countries that have mishandled the HIV&hyphen;AIDS debate. Let us not vilify those people who are at risk. Let us ensure that we provide for those people to ensure that they do not become infected. In my view, if the emu brigade wins this debate then it will cost lives. If they say that we should ban syringes or withdraw support systems for people who are at risk, then in my view we will lose more lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the minister, Dr Wooldridge, was praising the work of the Labor government last year he committed the government to expanding the third HIV&hyphen;AIDS strategy to take in hepatitis C, which, according to the minister, has the potential to add $400 million to the cost of the health system. This commitment, in my view, was code for pulling away money from HIV&hyphen;AIDS funding without adding any extra moneys to the overall health budget for what is recognised internationally as a public health crisis. If you add an additional major health issue on to the existing HIV budget, then inevitably there will be less money for HIV&hyphen;AIDS. Clearly, what needs to be done is additional money be put into the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even worse, the government has moved away from specific purpose payments in health funding so that the states and territories can fail to allocate funding to hepatitis C and other public health concerns at their own discretion. This has led to grave and soundly based fears amongst public health experts about how many resources regressive state parliaments will allocate to public health concerns which they perceive to be transmitted sexually.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the threat of HIV&hyphen;AIDS became known the previous Labor government acted decisively to save lives. Dr Blewett  acted with courage in a storm of protest from the emu brigade. Consequently, Australia has a proud record of one of the lowest rates of  HIV infection in the world, with a diagnosis rate of around 3.9 per 100,000 people. This is in contrast to countries like the United States and Spain which have the highest rates 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5242"> of infection of HIV&hyphen;AIDS per capita in the Western world&mdash;approximately treble Australia's rate of infection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The difference in these rates is due to the willingness to undertake widespread harm minimisation and community education prevention campaigns rather than just focusing on treatment and counting the numbers of people who are diagnosed with the disease. It is about working with communities who are affected by the disease to develop effective strategies rather than vilifying them for being affected in the first place. Labor did not bury its head in the sand with HIV&hyphen;AIDS. We saved lives. The current government has partly recognised our good work. In my view, it should now emulate it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a new health crisis for Australia. It requires additional resources for the country to deal with it. I do not believe the minister's actions in tacking on the issue to existing HIV&hyphen;AIDS funding is good enough. This is an issue which requires additional resources to stop what is now the beginnings of an epidemic becoming an outright total disaster for the country.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the motion moved by the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans), particularly his concerns that an increasing proportion of the population is affected by the hepatitis C virus. As a former nurse I am aware of the dangers of all the strains of the hepatitis virus. Viral hepatitis is an infectious disease which causes inflammation of the liver. This can result in cirrhosis of the liver, which can further lead to one of the world's most common and deadliest forms of cancer, primary liver cancer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the great dangers of hepatitis C is that carriers may not know that they have the virus. Testing for hepatitis C has been available only since 1990. Carriers do not always experience any symptoms, and where symptoms such as stomach pains and aches, tiredness and loss of appetite do occur they can often be attributed to other causes. Throughout this time their livers can be severely scarred.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This motion addresses the issue of raising the awareness of the community about hepatitis C. It is important for people to know how it is transmitted and who is in most danger from the disease. Hepatitis C is spread via infected blood. Those most at risk include people who received a blood transfusion prior to February 1990. Since that time all potential blood donors have been screened and all blood is tested. Also at most risk are intravenous drug users and people who have experienced unhygienic tattooing or other forms of skin piercing activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a tragic fact that the majority of people who have injected drugs now have hepatitis C, further endangering those users who do not yet have the virus. Male homosexuals who practise unsafe sex and prostitutes who practise unsafe sex are at risk, as are renal dialysis patients and people who frequently receive blood products, such as haemophiliacs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Hepatitis C infection to family members is uncommon and is not transmitted by ordinary social contact. Nurses and doctors working with patients must ensure their own safety and care in dealing with blood and blood products. Our health care workers can unknowingly be putting themselves at a great risk, because many people who are infected with hepatitis C may not know that they are infected and are therefore unable to inform their health care workers. Under these circumstances, needle stick injuries are a real risk for nurses, doctors and other health care providers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is officially estimated that more than 200,000 Australians are already infected with the hepatitis C virus. Unofficial estimates suggest the actual figure could be as high as one million people. Hepatitis C also affects 500 million people worldwide. People who suffer from hepatitis C must be extremely careful to ensure that others do not come into contact with their blood. This means that they should not share things such as a toothbrush, a razor or a nail file. If they cut themselves, they should immediately clean up the area where any blood is spilt with warm water and detergent. Cleaning the area with bleach may  also be useful. They should practise safe sex and not share a needle. It is also important for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5243"> carriers to inform health care providers of their condition for the safety of those who are treating them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Added to the dangers of this virus is the fact that, until recently, no drug has been shown to be effective against hepatitis C. I understand, however, that a genetically engineered drug known as Alpha Interferon has provided some encouraging results.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The need to raise community awareness about this virus has been taken up by a group of people in my home state of South Australia. The Hepatitis C Council of South Australia is a non-profit organisation which has been established to help sufferers of the virus and provide information to the community. The council also operates a hepatitis C support group for sufferers and their families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The seriousness of this virus warrants further urgent action by government and community groups. Comprehensive screening and assessment is needed Australia-wide to ensure community safety. I urge all governments to provide adequate funding to ensure that this can occur. I urge all members to support this motion and help raise awareness of the dangers of hepatitis C in the community.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I congratulate the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) on moving the motion and the former speakers for the points that they have made. There is no doubt that hepatitis C is a latent epidemic in Australia and one which has the potential to result in great cost to the community. The incubation period for chronic carriers can be as long as 20 years, and it is estimated perhaps even longer. There are also prospects of developments of various forms of liver cancer within five years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that the disease is so protracted has the potential to make its treatment far more expensive than even the treatment of HIV sufferers. Carriers of the hepatitis C virus will frequently need hospitalisation over many stages throughout their lives; hence the reason that it will become so costly. So, when the cost simply to the medical profession and also to the community in lost productivity, both from wage earners and also from housewives, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is realised, there is certainly a need for us now to address this problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the problem was discovered only in 1988 or 1989, it is clear that it has been developing; it has got a head of steam up of at least a decade&mdash;probably several decades ahead of those discoveries. We are now facing a situation, as previous speakers have indicated, where about 200,000 Australians have been affected with the virus. As I understand it, about five or six times more people are infected with hepatitis C than with the HIV virus, and the number of new cases detected each year is at least 10 times greater than the number of new cases of the HIV virus. So, when the situation is put in that context, the obvious need for government effort is demonstrated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In November 1995, the then Minister for Human Services and Health under the Labor government announced a $1.7 million funding package for a national hepatitis C education campaign. But clearly research has indicated that even greater numbers have been affected by the disease since then. There is a long, long way to go. For instance, a recent article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Health and Human Rights Journal</EMPHASIS>, Volume 2, No. 2, 1997, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . as distinct from the situation pertaining to HIV testing, there are no guidelines relating to counselling for HCV testing nor a requirement to provide such counselling. Nor has there been any systematic effort to inform medical practitioners or the public about the meaning of HCV test results.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As the member for Makin (Mrs Draper) mentioned, the public has to be educated as to the risks of simply sharing razors or toothbrushes, not that toothbrushes are commonly shared but it is not uncommon indeed to share razors. I have shared razors when I have been away and left one behind, for instance. It is not a risk well known in the community. Obviously there is a need for an education campaign. On 17 March the Medical Journal of Australia included an editorial. They said that, despite it being arguably the commonest life threatening infection in Australia, alarm bells have not been rung for hepatitis C. In fact, they have recommended a public awareness campaign rivalling the Grim Reaper campaign to heighten public awareness.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5244">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These things certainly have to be looked at. In particular, drug use crops up again as a chronic problem. One can only endorse the comments the other day by the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) calling for a national drug summit. In any event, dealing with the specific topic of the notice of motion, I think it will serve a purpose in this national forum of bringing some awareness to it. I think the minister can pick up the ball now and take that out to the broader community.</PARA>

Basically the theme that I would like to raise this afternoon involves the bogus claim, in my opinion, of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) that since the election in some way the Howard government has allegedly re-established free speech in this country. Honourable members might remember that after the honourable member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) made her maiden speech in this parliament the Prime Minister, instead of taking a clear stand in this parliament rebutting some of the inaccurate statements that were made by the honourable member for Oxley, addressed a Liberal Party meeting in Queensland and made the claim that his government had re-established free speech and that in some way the former Labor government&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MG4">Mr LEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Certainly many people expressed that view. Under the former Labor government, in no way was the honourable member for Oxley or anyone else intimidated or 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> prevented from saying what they may have believed. The point I want to make is the Prime Minister since the election has claimed that under the Howard government they have in some way re-established free speech.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think an interesting test of free speech is people's reactions to other people who criticise them. A test of a government's commitment to free speech is what reaction a government demonstrates if it is criticised by organisations and by individuals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last Friday I was very disturbed to learn on the ABC's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PM</EMPHASIS> program that the Howard government has decided to cease funding to two very important organisations. The first is the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation and the second is the national office of the Family Planning Association. I am sure there are members on both sides of this House who have attended meetings of their local combined pensioners' association, members of the local branches of the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation. I can remember during the time I was in government having to face some pretty heated meetings of the combined Pensioners and Superannuants Federation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the member for Banks interjects, they were very strong advocates for their members. They were very strong advocates for pensioners and superannuants. They were not backward in coming forward in attacking the former Labor government whenever they thought we had not met the high standards that they believed were necessary in addressing the needs of low income earners.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has happened since the election is that the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation, along with many other organisations that represent elderly people, have been just as critical of this government as they were of the former government. I do not think in any way the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation have been any less independent than they were before the last election. But for some reason this government, which claims to encourage free speech, has taken retaliatory action against this organisation that represents low income earners 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5245"> right around the country. In particular, the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) has totally scrapped the national government's funding for the pensioners' federation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is an outrage and they have also abolished funding for the Family Planning Association&mdash;another organisation that has been critical of both this government and the former Labor government in areas where the Family Planning Association thought governments could have done better.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What disturbs me is that the Minister for Health and Family Services, Dr Wooldridge, ordered a review into government funding for all of these national offices, not just the two I have mentioned but a number of others that also receive national government funding. This review was carried out by Coopers and Lybrand. To date the minister has refused to release the Coopers and Lybrand report. I therefore think it is very difficult for us to know whether the government has removed the funding from these two very worthy organisations because of some political agenda or political motive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This could be cleared up very easily if the Minister for Health and Family Services were prepared to release the Coopers and Lybrand report. In that way we would know whether or not there were some criticisms of the work that is being carried out by two organisations. I think both organisations deserve the right to rebut any unfair criticisms that may have been made of them. I can certainly assure the government that members of the local combined pensioners' association branches in places such as Long Jetty, Gorokan and Wyong in my own electorate are going to be very disturbed if the government is not prepared to release that report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are going to question whether or not this government, which claims to allow free speech, has singled out these two organisations for `special' treatment because they may have said things that were critical of the government in the past. By the way, if the government has reached that conclusion, I would encourage it to go back and look at the past issues of the newsletters of those organi 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sations. They were just as critical of the former Labor government as they have been of this government. The reason is that they are an organisation that speaks out very strongly for the interests of low income retirees in particular, people who are struggling to get by on the base pension. It will be very difficult for their voice to be heard once the federal government axes the funding for these organisations later this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point I would like to make is that there is a bit of a pattern emerging. As I say, last Friday we had the Minister for Health and Family Services, Dr Wooldridge, announcing that he was cutting out all the funding for the Pensioner and Superannuants Federation and the Family Planning Association. Last year he accused the medical students of being thugs in white coats because they had the temerity to try to oppose the government in the retrospective and unfair changes that the government made to doctors in training. Probably the most infamous event in recent days was that exposed in the Senate estimates committees when certain documents were tabled by the Labor opposition that demonstrated that certain people were involved in coordinating a campaign against Kerry O'Brien, the host of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> on ABC television.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For some reason, the Prime Minister and his office and senior members of this government have a set against Kerry O'Brien&mdash;Kerry O'Brien who night after night demonstrates that he is just as tough on Labor Party spokesmen as he is on Liberal Party ministers, Kerry O'Brien who for years has appeared on ABC television, on Channel 10 and on many different television programs seeking to place every interviewee under sustained pressure and sustained questioning, and Kerry O'Brien who, I think, is held in very high regard probably by a number of Liberal members as well as by people on our side of the House. He is certainly held in high regard by many of the journalists in the press gallery here in Canberra and by other journalists around the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I do think is outrageous is for people to seek to draft questions which seek to imply that Mr O'Brien has received special treatment from ABC management. I understand 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5246"> that, since these questions were drafted in the Prime Minister's office and polished by the Minister for Communications and the Arts, Senator Alston, and his staff, and since Senator Coonan provided those questions which were tabled in the Senate estimates committee, we have had ABC management deny that some of the implications of those questions were true.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today, firstly, to bring to the attention of the House concerns relating to the activities of the Australian Performing Rights Association, more commonly known as APRA, and, secondly, to call for a review of the operations of APRA to sharpen the Commonwealth Copyright Act 1968 and ultimately curb the recent excesses of this association.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">APRA is a non-government copyright association of songwriters and music publishers which has been operating in Australia since 1926. It began as a well&hyphen;intentioned representative group which aimed to safeguard the rights of its members. The Copyright Act 1968 recognises a number of economic rights of composers and songwriters, and APRA's members have assigned to it three of their exclusive rights under law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, APRA has the authority to collect licence fees payable for these rights, and one which has importance in this speech tonight is the public performance right. Apart from the right to broadcast the work, which is a licence to radio or television stations, the owner of copyright also has a public performance right which includes circumstances where music is played using equipment such as compact disc players, cassette recorders, radio and television sets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be inaccurate to infer that the bulk of composers in Australia are obscenely wealthy or undeserving of support. I have no problems with the 50 or so composers of original works in Cairns or elsewhere in my electorate receiving their just rewards when others are making money out of their music. Therefore, I am not defending a night club's use of songs or music video clips without a licence. I do not advocate potential abuse by prosperous music theme businesses like the Hard Rock Cafe, nor am I standing up for large electrical retail chains which tune in their display televisions to entertaining TV programs like Parliament House question time, although after today's performance I 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5247"> feel I can give up waiting by my letterbox for my APRA cheque.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly these businesses profit directly from the work of talented artists and should pay for the public performance right. These businesses have been the logical target of the Copyright Act. But, for the last 12 months or so, APRA clearly has been missing its mark. It has been slugging those struggling small businesses whose staff use radio or television to ease the boredom of mundane jobs. It has targeted family businesses whose employees, while doing their work, listen to the radio to keep in touch with the outside world. It is clear that this is quite out of line with the original intent of the Copyright Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My electorate office has been flooded with inquiries, concerns and complaints from people who work very, very long hours just to break even. They are angry at having to pay APRA for the privilege of having a radio or television playing in the background. What disturbs me is that, in most of these cases, the people are wrongly led to believe that APRA licensing represents another government tax on small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From this flood of complaints, I would like to draw a couple of examples. Amongst those to receive an APRA notice was a Cairns real estate agent by the name of Brian Hampton. He says that his one and only officer worker listens to a transistor radio when filing. When he received the notice he thought it was a bad joke. Brian argues&mdash;and I agree&mdash;that charging small businesses to listen to the local radio station is ridiculous and that to enforce the law is downright impossible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am aware of another case of a woman living in Cooktown who received a call from an APRA assessor; this happened to be in the lead-up to the recent Cyclone Justin. She was asked if she was listening to the radio, and she replied that she was. The assessor said, `You could well be liable for an APRA fee,' and she replied, `I'm only listening for cyclone notices.' He then said, `It doesn't matter. You're listening to the radio, you have a store, and you will be liable for it. We'll send you out the forms.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is quite outrageous that people under those circumstances can be subjected to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this type of impost. Just the nature of the call and the types of letters that are sent out certainly go to intimidate these small business people into feeling they really have an obligation to pay this impost when in actual fact it is well and truly off the mark.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should think that music has lured none us into buying an extra magazine at our local newsagency or an extra hamburger or serve of fish and chips at our local corner store. But APRA would certainly have you think that this happens all the time. Even listening to talkback radio is unacceptable to APRA because, as the organisation has stated, no Australian talkback radio show has 100 per cent non-music content. As a consequence, they use this as a basis for insisting that people should pay their fees. As I said earlier, if businesses are using music or videos specifically to entice customers, then I think a fee is justified. But APRA's heavy-handed blanket approach to business, without considering the true uses of radio and television, is absolutely outrageous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Along with the `courtesy notice' my constituent received was an APRA question and answer sheet. It makes the point that when playing music at home, in your car or in a hotel room is not considered to be a public performance. However, once outside your domestic environment it is considered public performance. The next time that I go to the beach I guess I will have to leave my radio at home just in case our local lifeguard is on duty and is really an APRA assessor in disguise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Copyright Tribunal was established under the Copyright Act 1968. This was done to balance the rights of collecting societies which seek to obtain fair remuneration for the creators they represent against the interests of users of copyright material who seek to use copyright material on reasonable terms and conditions. For much of the last 20-odd years since the introduction of this act, there has been due respect and fairness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recent opportunism by APRA in targeting small businesses inappropriately has had one of two effects. In some instances proprietors, like the real estate agent Brian Hampton, have decided to conform with the law, as interpret 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5248"> ed by APRA, at work and ensure that staff only listen to a radio at home. In other cases, despite the existence of a tribunal, businesses have submitted to APRA's standover tactics and have taken up yet another burden rather than go to court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Parliament, I believe, should take responsibility for its laws and see that the intended focus and legislation remains. Once a sound idea is translated into loosely worded legislation, it can be misused and carried to extremes. In APRA's question and answer sheet to small businesses, and in reference to the Copyright Act, answer No. 35 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">APRA does not make the Law. It is up to the courts to interpret the Law . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I would hasten to add that it is up to us to amend that law. Judging from the volume of concerns and complaints I receive in my office on a very regular basis, a review and appropriate amendments to APRA are certainly long overdue.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="5248"><TITLE>Marriage Education and Counselling Services

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today, if I can do so in the time I have available, I would like to try to cover three issues quickly. Earlier this year, the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) visited Townsville. One of the main reasons for his visit was to talk to Centacare about the availability of funding for marriage education and counselling services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following the Attorney-General's visit, I received a follow-up letter from the Director of Centacare, Mr Tony McDermott. Part of that letter related to the Principal of St Michael's Catholic School on Palm Island, Sister Veronica, and the fact that a child from the school had committed suicide on the previous night. That child was the third suicide victim on Palm Island in six weeks. While this is indeed horrific, it is unfortunately not surprising.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In one of my first speeches in this House I spoke about the incidence of youth suicide on Palm Island. Back then a similar spate of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> suicides had taken place. The worst part was that the people committing suicide were generally aged between 17 and 25 years. Indeed some of those young people had children of their own. The government has been very active in the area of addressing suicide, particularly youth suicide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As honourable members know, the government has allocated $31 million towards suicide prevention and research and support programs. While I wholeheartedly welcome and support these efforts, I still remain to be convinced about the situation on Palm Island. I am concerned because I do not think the programs we have initiated address the particular circumstances that exist on this island. Much emphasis has been placed on the provision of help lines and organisations such as Lifeline, Kids Help Line and Parent Line, and rightly so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The value of these organisations and services cannot be calculated, particularly in terms of the lives they literally may save on a day-to-day basis. The problem is that access to phone services on Palm Island is very limited indeed. Access to crisis counselling via the phone may not culturally be the best way of addressing these sorts of problems on the deed of grant in trust on Palm Island. It was only about one week ago that my office was trying to contact the Palm Island council to organise meetings for me on the island, but the phone and fax lines to Palm Island were inoperable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For most people, this would have been nothing more than an annoying and frustrating inconvenience, but suicide waits for no-one. When a person has reached such a crisis point where they can see little reason for waking up in the morning, access to some sort of one&hyphen;to&hyphen;one personal counselling contact needs to be there and needs to be available. What happens when there is no access to the telephone? Less than 10 per cent of the residents on Palm Island have access to a telephone. Communal access to phones is limited, and many of the small number of public phones are inoperable due to vandalism. It is such a shame.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to ask the parliament to take a good close look at Palm Island and other remote areas in Australia where there is not 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5249"> regular and easy access to public and private phones. Places like Palm Island are special cases, but their remoteness should not disqualify them from accessing counselling services, particularly when lives are at risk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Still on counselling services, the more people, support groups, crisis organisations and community leaders that I speak to, the more I am convinced that a specific and targeted form of funding is required to support men, both young and old, in crisis counselling and relationship education. I support this proposition because this is what I am being told by people who should know: for example, Lifeline and the managers of women's shelters and crisis care facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I spoke to Sylvia Rueben, the manager of Palm Island's women shelter, the last time I visited the island. While I was there I discussed with Sylvia the causes of the problems she sees walk through her door on a daily basis&mdash;domestic violence, family breakdown, alcoholism, drug abuse and so on. When I asked her what above all else could be done to relieve these problems, she nominated the need for men's counselling and education services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last month, only about four weeks ago, the Director of Lifeline Townsville, Reverend Ev Blackman, came to see me. Reverend Ev Blackman would be one of the most respected people in our Townsville community who knows and understands from all of the cases that he sees from his Lifeline service just where the problems are. Reverend Blackman said to me, `Peter, we must do something about a men's crisis counselling service in this country today.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not about women having these particular facilities so men should have the facilities. This is not a sexist matter at all. Indeed, I am very concerned that today the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Townsville Bulletin</EMPHASIS> has rung me with some kind of suggestion emanating in my electorate that, in trying to raise these issues on the national agenda, there is some kind of hidden agenda supporting men. That is absolutely not my agenda, and I reject utterly that kind of criticism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When there is a need in the community, you have to speak about it. There is a need in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this case. Men cry too. Mr Bruce Young, who is an intelligent and passionate supporter of issues relating to the family, is trying to get funding for a coordinated and appropriately targeted men's counselling and resource centre. Certainly Reverend Ev Blackman has indicated his full support for such a service and has indicated in the past that it could be provided under the auspices of Lifeline North Queensland subject to board approval. I firmly support these proposals. I will certainly be asking the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) to look quite closely this year at making these kinds of services available in the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to briefly turn to the Black Hawk disaster which occurred on 12 June last year. The minister kindly made a statement in the parliament earlier today in question time. During the Black Hawk disaster, the lives of 18 Australian Defence Force personnel were claimed. Of those killed, 15 were members of the elite Special Air Services regiment based in Swanbourne Barracks in Western Australia. The other three were flight crew from 5 Aviation Regiment based in Townsville.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reaction of emergency rescue and medical teams, both civilian and military, was outstanding. I was at the Townsville General Hospital within an hour and a half of the crash occurring. It was under the most trying of circumstances that the professionalism, expertise and commitment of all those involved came through in the medical evacuation of the injured. I would like to thank all members and senators of the parliament for the messages of support and condolence that were sent through me to 5 Aviation Regiment. It was certainly warmly welcomed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The volume and sincerity of those messages from across all political parties spoke of a deep pride and respect for the men and women of our defence forces that no words can adequately express. I am pleased that the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop) was able to finalise military compensation upgrades and reforms before the anniversary of the Black Hawk disaster. These changes and reforms have been warmly welcomed in Townsville, as they 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5250"> have been throughout Australia. While the issue is one that the minister has been personally involved in for a long time, no-one, least of all the minister, wanted the Black Hawk disaster to be a trigger for the long overdue upgrading of military compensation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nonetheless, the minister should be applauded for the changes that she has won for ADF personnel and their families. They are not public servants in uniform, as she correctly said earlier today. I can understand how some people will never be satisfied with the level of compensation allocated for death or serious injury. After all, how do you adequately compensate a husband, wife or child of an ADF member who is killed or seriously injured? How does one put a dollar figure on a person's life, a person's ability to walk, to run or to lead a normal life?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But limits need to be set and at some point a line has to be drawn in the sand. I do not envy the task that the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel set for herself following that disaster. But the changes the minister has delivered are good and they are a significant improvement on the old system of military compensation.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="5250"><TITLE>Darebin City Council</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to raise grievances on behalf of a very large number of people in Melbourne, especially people of ethnic background, about a recent action of the Kennett government in Victoria. I refer to the precipitous and totally unjustified action of the Victorian Minister for Planning and Local Government, Mr MacLellan, in dismissing the Darebin City Council and appointing an administrator. There is no doubt that the dismissal of this council is a complete abrogation of the principles of democracy. It has been condemned by both local government organisations in Victoria.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, it is much more than that. It is an outrageous abuse of power by a Liberal government against the most solid Labor council in Melbourne. It is simply a vicious payback on the people of that region of Melbourne who had the temerity to vote for ALP councillors in all nine wards of the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> council. Most serious of all is the deliberate blow which this action has struck to one of the fundamental principles of multiculturalism in Australia, namely, the principle of access and equity to the political process by people of a non-English speaking or ethnic background. Five out of the nine elected councillors in the city of Darebin are of ethnic background.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The critical point is this: the Mayor of Darebin, who has been dismissed in this way, is the first ever Lebanese born mayor elected in any council in Victoria. The election of Mr Nazih el Asmar as mayor was greeted by the Lebanese community of Melbourne as an historic breakthrough for their community and was greeted with great jubilation in that community. Mr El Asmar had been mayor only since 11 April. He had hardly had the opportunity to initiate his programs before he was dismissed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I shall argue presently, the minister had no good reason to dismiss the council. I believe that in making his decision the minister was dominated by views put out by racist persons who have sought to slander the council and the mayor, Mr El Asmar. There is no doubt that in this vicious action the minister has pandered to racists and anti&hyphen;multiculturalists. In so doing, he has demeaned his office, he has created enormous resentment amongst the people of the city of Darebin and he has generated enormous anger and opposition from the Lebanese community and other ethnic communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has shamefully misused his powers by acting in this totalitarian way. He has sought to take away the rights of citizens for no good reason. The minister, in his letter to the mayor about the dismissal, gave no reasons for the action. The only justification in the media was provided by one of the minister's spokesmen who claimed that Darebin had rejected the Liberal government's recommendation that a mediator be appointed to resolve differences between the council and the chief executive officer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This statement by the minister's assistant is false. In fact, since the report by Mr David Elsum, commissioned by the minister himself, was produced in May, the council as a whole 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5251"> determined to work with and assist in every other way the mediator. In a press statement issued on 30 May and given to the minister, the mayor stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite our view that good governance in Darebin does not depend on the appointment of a Mediator, we make it clear that should you decide to appoint a genuinely independent Mediator for the purpose of further improving governance in Darebin, that we would co&hyphen;operate fully with such a Mediator as is our professional duty to do so.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In fact, Mr Elsum in his report did not recommend the dismissal of the council. He recommended the appointment of a mediator, and this is a request to which the council agreed. So what was the real reason the minister proceeded in this way? Clearly, he did not like the fact that nine Labor members were elected in all nine wards. But that is democracy, and it is his business to respect the democratic will of the people if local government in Victoria is to mean anything. As the mayor said in a statement today:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We were elected by the people of Darebin and we consider that it is our duty to continue to serve them until they elect other councillors in democratic elections.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As I have already indicated, this betrayal of democracy is not the only issue. The  Victorian Minister for Planning and Local Government, Mr MacLellan, also decided to take notice of scurrilous attacks that were made on the mayor and other councillors because of their ethnic background. From the time of the nomination of Mr El Asmar, an underground campaign by racist elements began, the intention of which was to undermine him and to suggest that he was not a person fit for the office of mayor. This campaign took the form of anonymous `dirt sheets' whose purpose was to create the impression that Mr El Asmar was selected as mayor for no other reason than internal machinations of the Labor Party. The fact that he had been a prominent contributor to the local community and to the ethnic Lebanese community was ignored.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next step in this dirty process was for certain Liberal members of the parliament in Victoria to read from these dirt sheets and to repeat comments made in them under parliamentary privilege. The Liberal Party was acting to set up a situation for the dismissal 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of the council by trying to give credence to such material pedalled by racists and anti-multiculturalists. The minister has denigrated his office and has come down to the gutter in failing to follow the recommendations of his own report but instead using the lies of these people as a basis for smearing Mr El Asmar for acting against the council.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Kennett government has claimed to be a supporter of multiculturalism and ethnic communities. Mr MacLellan, by his actions, has shown that this is complete hypocrisy. This is not the first time that the Kennett government has sought to punish ethnic communities for supporting the Labor Party, but this is the most disgraceful incident in which a minister has associated himself with the actions of racists and anti-multiculturalists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Kennett government stands up and criticises Pauline Hanson and others on multiculturalism, yet he allows Minister MacLellan to carry out actions of this kind which are directed specifically against a council that is very multicultural and against the first ever elected Lebanese mayor in Victoria. The Premier may try to hide behind the report, but Mr El Asmar was not even there when the inquiry was initiated by Minister MacLellan. In what way was it his fault? Why was he not at least entitled to an explanation before such an outrageous action?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, this is not an isolated incident. There have been many actions in Victoria directed at preventing people from ethnic backgrounds achieving political office or undermining them when they do so. The principles of democracy and multiculturalism are under great threat in today's society. We need to protect them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Premier must act immediately to restore Darebin council and Mr El Asmar as mayor; otherwise he will be exposed for hypocrisy on these matters, and the message will certainly go out to all of the ethnic communities of Melbourne about where he really stands on this key issue of multiculturalism. There is no doubt that, if the Victorian Premier fails in this duty, he will be associating himself with the actions of Minister MacLellan, who is well known for his attacks  on Labor councils and who has done nothing 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5252"> to support the participation of people from ethnic background in the council process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an enormous set back for the access and equity policy and strategy, which was outlined and supported on previous occasions by both political parties and is in the statutes of the Victorian government. Part of that policy is to encourage people of different backgrounds to participate  in the political process. Not only have we had an undermining of democracy for no good reason, not only have we had the dismissal of the most solid Labor council precisely because it is Labor, but also we have had an action which is totally unjustified against Mr El Asmar. It is an action against the Lebanese community and, indeed, all of the ethnic communities of Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The action has been condemned by both of the local government associations in Victoria. The action has been described as totally unjustified. The Premier of Victoria ought to recognise that, unless he takes action to restore Mr El Asmar and the Darebin council, this issue will not go away; it will continue to fester. The people of Darebin and the people in that region, who have had meetings even today to discuss this issue, will not accept this abrogation of democracy, this attack on democracy. They will continue to respect their councillors that they elected until this matter is resolved.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="5252"><TITLE>Blainey, Professor Geoffrey</TITLE>

It may be the first twitch of the weathervane warning of changes to come. Sometimes it is a piece of the puzzle quietly sliding into place that helps bring clarity to the picture.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a press release last Tuesday, 11 June, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) announced the appointment of Professor Geoffrey Blainey to the Council of the Australian War Memorial. This was not the first instance of official favour towards Pro 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> fessor Blainey by the Howard government. In December last year, he was also appointed by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to serve as a member of the Centenary of Federation Council&mdash;the body responsible for advising on the events and functions to celebrate our nation's centenary as a federation in 2001. Neither appointment attracted much public comment. They were buried under the headlines of the day. But it would be a serious omission for these appointments to go by unremarked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Professor Blainey is a prolific writer who has made a major contribution to debate on our nation's history. The issue I raise today is not that of his professional credentials&mdash;about that there is no argument&mdash;but his contributions to public debate as a social commentator and essayist. Professor Blainey is, after all, no stranger to controversy. It is reasonable to ask precisely what sort of message these appointments, this government endorsement of him, sends to the public and the world at large.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Political memories are often short, so it is worthwhile recalling Blainey's most notorious contribution to Australian public life&mdash;the ignition of the so-called `Asianisation', or race, debate which has dogged us for the past thirteen years and which has flared so brightly and so dangerously in the past fifteen months. It was Blainey, after all, who started it all off. He was the person who lit the fuse in that fateful speech in Warrnambool on 17 March 1984, when he proclaimed his arguments for a racially discriminatory immigration policy. In words which have an eerie contemporary resonance, he declared the pace of Asian immigration to Australia to be well ahead of public opinion and warned of conflict and turmoil in the suburbs of our nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reaction to those remarks was explosive. By speaking as he did, Professor Blainey fuelled the community fears on which he put such weight. More than that, he gave credibility and legitimacy to some of the more ignorant and sinister elements of the Australian community, who quickly found new inspiration and voice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although he later claimed to be surprised at the effect of his words, Blainey did not 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5253"> hesitate to fan the flames. When challenged, he became ever more strident and extreme. He warned of the coming `Asianisation' of Australia. He said that Asian immigrants were `very conspicuous' in high unemployment suburbs and complained that a sense of national guilt was driving immigration policy&mdash;guilt from our involvement in Vietnam and guilt from the memory of the White Australia policy. He accused the then Labor Government of a `surrender-Australia' policy, and he warned of dire consequences if Asian immigration were not slashed. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I'm seeing a coming danger . . . Australia could develop the same problems as Birmingham in Britain and of certain parts of the United States.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He wrote provocatively of suburbs on the `front line' and `invaded' neighbourhoods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If all of this sounds familiar, it should. It was Blainey who unquestionably mapped out the intellectual terrain, prepared the ground, for the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) and her racist One Nation party. In 1985 he attacked what he claimed to be the `vocal, richly subsidised multicultural lobby' and spoke of the need for Australia to be `one nation', rather than `a nation of many nations'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1993, he was again in the political spotlight, railing against the Mabo judgment. He denigrated the High Court, claimed it had not done its work properly and called on the then Chief Justice, Sir Anthony Mason to resign. He condemned the Native Title Act for discriminating against non-indigenous people with this fatuous claim:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The average Aborigine has about twelve times as much land as the average non-Aborigine . . . ever increasing grants of land to Aborigines is probably a step towards two peoples and two nations, or worst of all, two half nations.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Blainey has never recanted his views. On the contrary, when interviewed in November last year, he defended his 1984 statement as `sensible'. When asked whether he had since changed his position on Asian immigration, he said, `No, my views are basically the same . . . You don't set out to change the racial composition of your country too quickly.' He has also maintained his attack on the High Court, again on the Mabo and Wik judgments, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and he characterised the Native Title Act as racist and arguing that Aborigines should only hold land on exactly the same terms as all other Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No wonder then that Professor Blainey is a hero of the extreme right fringe. Let there be no doubt about it, he has given intellectual respectability and support to some of the most poisonous and sinister elements in our community. Over 13 years he has consistently fanned the flames and stoked the fires. He has been the intellectual point man for the forces of darkness. His influence on public affairs has certainly been profound&mdash;it has been profoundly negative and profoundly divisive. Indeed, the impact of his contributions to political debate has been such that he can justly be characterised as the thinking person's David Irving.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But Professor Blainey's influence and appeal do not stop with the lunar right. On the contrary, it goes right to the heart of the Howard government, where he now enjoys endorsement and patronage. In November last year, the Prime Minister popularised the notion of the black armband view of Australian history. In his Robert Menzies Lecture, Mr Howard attacked those who he claimed take the view that Australians should apologise for most of our history. I quote him thus:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This black armband view of our past reflects a belief that most Australian history since 1788 has been little more than a disgraceful story of imperialism, exploitation, racism, sexism and other forms of discrimination. I take a very different view.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Prime Minister is very much attached to these words. He used them last month when he finally, belatedly and grudgingly came out and criticised the member for Oxley&mdash;more than seven months after she followed in Blainey's tracks to spark a new wave of racial bigotry and intolerance. Nor could the Prime Minister resist recycling the idea in his shameful performance at the national reconciliation convention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But where did the notion of the black armband view originate? Mr Howard has not acknowledged his intellectual debt, but there is no question about its origins&mdash;they lie with Geoffrey Blainey, of course; to be precise, with Blainey's 1993 Latham Lecture. That is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5254"> where it came from. This lecture marked Professor Blainey's first articulation of the expression `the black armband view', an idea which effectively denies recognition and representation to the dispossessed and the marginalised in our history and which fundamentally attacks their right to pursue remedies for present&hyphen;day injustices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that speech Blainey also invoked the metaphor of the pendulum, arguing that the black armband view represented a swing from a position that had been too favourable and too self&hyphen;congratulatory to the opposite extreme&mdash;that it was unreal and decidedly jaundiced. The pendulum is certainly now swinging. It is swinging towards a dark and narrow vision of our past and our future, one in which concepts such as the `black armband view', `mainstream Australia' and `One Nation' are used as a sinister code to cloak prejudice, mean&hyphen;spiritedness and an assault on fundamental rights&mdash;particularly indigenous rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No surprise here that the Prime Minister has also adopted the metaphor of the pendulum with all its false connotations of balance and reasonableness. In respect of the Wik judgment&mdash;the product of what Blainey calls `the black armband tribunal'&mdash;the Prime Minister has already made it clear that he intends to pull indigenous rights back to what he considers to be a balanced position. He did so again in this House today, but it is a position which one way or another will see widespread extinguishment of native title with all the division, all the injustice and all the sense of betrayal that will flow from that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would not be going too far to call Professor Blainey the official historian of the Howard government, but that is not his only role as an historical adviser. It is not only the Prime Minister who owes him a direct intellectual debt. In his Latham Lecture, Blainey took pains to highlight negative aspects of indigenous life prior to European settlement. He emphasised the loss of life in traditional Aboriginal society, whether through infanticide or through warfare, which he claimed was probably on a large scale. Four years later, this theme was taken up in that odious publication <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Pauline Hanson: the truth</EMPHASIS>, with 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> its sinister portrayal of indigenous people as scarcely removed from alleged cannibal ancestors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said on another occasion, anyone with a sense of history will recall Nazi portrayals of Jews as vermin. Denigration and dehumanisation were the essential first steps before Jewish citizens were denied their rights. In essence, One Nation's approach is the same, with the Prime Minister's historian, Professor Blainey, a willing accomplice. For, as we now know, he has been in contact with the member for Oxley, offering her encouragement and reportedly helping her office in digging up historical references to alleged Aboriginal cannibalism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me conclude my remarks today by pointing out that the Prime Minister is renowned for talking in code&mdash;for appearing to say one thing, but sending another message. The Prime Minister spoke loudly today about the balance and reasonableness of his approach to the Wik judgment, but Professor Blainey's official appointment and the Prime Minister's clear embrace of Blainey's view of our nation's past and future send another message to all of us. It is a message of narrowness, of small-mindedness and of meanness of spirit. It augurs ill for the future of our country as a tolerant, outward looking and diverse society. All members of this House would do well to reflect upon the message and do what we can to ensure that such a future does not come to pass. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="5254"><TITLE>Warringah Peninsula: Transportation Difficulties</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to have the opportunity to bring to the attention of the parliament the transport problems of my electorate. Warringah is the best place in the world to live until you want to get somewhere else, then you have to use a road system which is becoming more and more clogged by the month.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a quarter of a million people living on the Warringah Peninsula. But that is not all, there are many millions more who come there for their pleasure because the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5255"> Warringah Peninsula is Sydney's premier tourist destination. It is home to Balmoral Beach, Taronga Park Zoo, the Manly Corso and all those other beautiful northern beaches which have helped to give Sydney its unique flavour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Eight million people visit Manly every year at the moment and in the years leading up to the Olympics and in the decade of economic opportunity which the Olympics will usher in, more and more people will be spending time on the northern peninsula. It is safe to say that people will spend a lot more time in the Warringah Peninsula than they will at Homebush Bay. The problem is that they will be coming to the best parts of the best city on earth and they will find themselves increasingly in one giant traffic jam.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The biggest problem is that the main route in and out of the Warringah Peninsula is Military Road and Spit Road between Neutral Bay and the Spit, and this route is now operating at virtual saturation point. If you travel from Brookvale to Wynyard on Military Road and Spit Road in the morning peak period, you will average 10 kilometres per hour. In other words, a jogger could make it from Brookvale to Wynyard faster than someone on the bus. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> recently reported that someone in the bus between Spit Junction and Cremorne Junction was actually beaten by someone on the footpath in a wheelchair. It has reached saturation point for most of its length, and so has Warringah Road which is the other main route in and out of the peninsula. In fact, the peninsula's major traffic arteries have become some of the world's longest and largest car parks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not as if people have not seen this coming. It was back in the 1870s that there was the first call for a railway line from the city to Narrabeen. In the 1930s, Dr Bradfield believed that the Sydney Harbour Bridge should be accompanied by a rail spur to the Warringah Peninsula. In the 1970s, we built what has become known as the Warringah Expressway. The trouble with the Warringah Expressway is that it ends up at Cammeray, which is nowhere near the Warringah Peninsula. In the early 1990s, the Transit North 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Group recommended a light-rail system between North Sydney and Brookvale, and in the mid&hyphen;1990s we had the then Liberal&hyphen;National state government set up something called a `section 22 committee' which was designed to come up with lasting solutions to the transport problems of the peninsula.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, the deliberations of this committee were absolutely stymied when the incoming Labor government made it perfectly clear that there would be no public money for transport improvements on the Warringah Peninsula. Unfortunately, what Premier Bob Carr seemed to be doing with that announcement was saying to people, `If you vote Liberal, the state Labor government will punish you in this way.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was another problem with the work of the section 22 committee. The preference of that committee seemed to be for a heavy&hyphen;rail line from Brookvale to the city via Frenchs Forest and Chatswood. There are two problems with that idea. The first is that it would not get the commuters to the city faster than the existing bus, even though the bus is crawling along at 14 kilometres per hour in the transit lane. The second problem with that solution is that it would inevitably lead to very large population increases on the peninsula, and that means too many cars, too much concrete and too few trees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But there is, I am pleased to say, another possibility that I like to think of as the Mosman bus route and road tunnel. This involves the construction of&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="MELHAM" NAMEID="4T4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4T4">Mr Melham</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A tunnel!</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EZ5">Mr ABBOTT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, and I am sorry that Laurie Brereton is not here to listen to me talking about a tunnel. Not everything that Laurie did was bad. The fact is that we could have a new road tunnel from the Parrawi Road intersection to the Warringah Expressway at Cammeray, and that would enable the transport problems of the peninsula to be substantially tackled for the first time in nearly a century. It would be coupled with intersection improvements at Sydney Road in Seaforth. It would be coupled with improved access to the expressway at Cammeray.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5256">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The beauty of this proposition is that it does not involve the resumption of a single block of land. It does not involve the destruction of a single tree. It does not involve the division of any communities. It does mean that the communities of Mosman, Neutral Bay, Cremorne and North Sydney can become normal suburbs again. They can become normal communities instead of being, as they are at the moment, suburbs divided by a road. It also means that there can be a permanent busway, if necessary, from Manly Vale right into the Warringah Expressway, and that will permanently tilt the balance of convenience in favour of public transport. So this solution, if it were to be adopted by the community, is not a private transport solution. It is a balanced solution that enables public transport to be permanently improved to the benefit of all the various commuters in the peninsula.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Engineering estimates are that this Mosman bus route and road tunnel, with associated improvements, would cost about $400 million to build. The state government should spend that money because I believe that the people of Warringah are just as entitled as the people of any other part of Sydney to their fair share of the state transport dollar. But, if the state government is not prepared to go down that path, there are other ways. It could be funded by a toll. The estimates are that it could be funded by a toll without any increases in existing traffic, without any increases in population and without any increases in housing density.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another way of looking at funding this is through some of the measures that were implemented in the federal budget. The federal budget restored infrastructure bonds for road building. The other notable innovation of the federal budget is the Federation Fund to fund economically useful projects, especially projects to be undertaken in conjunction with state governments and the private sector. So it would seem to me that a Mosman bus route and road tunnel is almost the epitome of the kind of project that should be considered for funding under the Federation Fund. So there are three sources of funding for this very important improvement to the amenity of the peninsula and to the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> amenity of the whole of Sydney because the whole of Sydney enjoys the facilities of the peninsula. Indeed, the whole of Australia enjoys the facilities of the peninsula, and that is why this is not just a local project and a regional project. It is something of national importance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are three ways of finding the money and all it takes is for Bob Carr to say it ought to be done. If he does not say it ought to be done, people will conclude that the only obstacle in the way of a better public transport system on the peninsula is none other than Bob Carr. I am asking the New South Wales Premier, on behalf of the quarter of a million people who live in the Warringah Peninsula: please think again about Warringah transport. I am happy to work with the Premier. I am sure my state and federal colleagues are happy to work with the Premier on this. The SHOROC group of councils would be happy to work with the Premier on this. We do not want to score political points. We simply want to get a better deal for the ordinary people of the peninsula and for all those other Sydneysiders and outsiders who want to make use of the beauties of the peninsula.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to the Premier of New South Wales: please reconvene that section 22 committee. Give that committee six months to come to a decision on whatever it thinks is the best transport outcome and then build it. We have had a hundred years of talking. It is now time to get on with the building. If we do not build it, the beautiful parts of my electorate may well turn out to be known as `the lost suburbs of Sydney' because almost no&hyphen;one will be able to get in and out.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="5256"><TITLE>Private Health Insurance</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Institute of Family Studies released a report in March 1997 entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Family Profiles</EMPHASIS> . Amongst other things, the report focuses on aging trends in Australia and the impact that the projected size and proportion of our aging population will have on our future economic and social structures. It is in this context that I wish to express the need for a substantial reform of our national health care system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5257">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Institute of Family Studies report estimates that the number of Australians aged 65 and over is projected to double from 2.15 million in 1995 to 5.48 million by the year 2041. It asserts that our aging population will see a substantial burden placed on future public expenditure `unless the elderly population is required to plan to cover a substantial proportion of its own costs.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This trend is already being felt in our health care system where federal spending has increased by more than 20 per cent over the past five years in an attempt to keep pace with the ever&hyphen;increasing demand for so&hyphen;called `free' health care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Earlier this year I said in this place, and repeated, that the current generation of fully employed Australians is being asked to pay for the retirement of two generations because of an inadequate level of national savings. The Institute of Family Studies has confirmed this. It found that the dependency ratio&mdash;that is, the proportion of people not of working age&mdash;is increasing and that the shift in the aged dependency ratio will mean a `dramatic increase in the number and proportion of the population relying on government support.' Increased life expectancy and lower birth rates will see this trend become even more pronounced over the ensuing decades. The institute's report went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The costs associated with an increased aging population are greater than the savings generated by reduced costs of children . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It stated that this was `mainly due to health care costs.' That is the key to my remarks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have maintained the view that a government funded age pension should be reserved for those who need it. Consistent with this is my belief that unemployment benefits should not be regarded as unearned or as an automatic entitlement. In the same way, it is right and reasonable to expect that those who can afford to pay for their own health care should be expected to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Productivity Commission's report into private health insurance was released at about the same time as that of the Institute of Family Studies. It found that the increasing proportion of aged members of health funds 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> had `significant' implications for health fund costs. It observed:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The usage and cost of hospitalisation is very much higher for older age groups and with few low claim, low cost contributors (ie, the young and healthy) to compensate, the more likely the health funds will be faced with higher payouts on claims.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This in turn has seen, and will continue to see, an increase in insurance premiums. The Productivity Commission found that younger, healthy individuals are the most likely to drop out of private health insurance as premiums are increased. Simply put, as the number of high risk members&mdash;that is, those who draw on their health insurance&mdash;of health funds continues to increase, premiums are forced up and the number of low risk members continues to decrease. And so the cycle continues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Private health insurance now accounts for only 11 per cent of the community's total expenditure on health. In contrast, the Commonwealth and states now fund 80 per cent of the expenditure on public hospitals and medical services. This is unsustainable and must be reversed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">1975 was a turning point in Australia's health care history. The introduction of Medibank in that year saw private health insurance drop by 18 per cent within a mere 12 months. The decline continued over the following decade and was helped along by the introduction of Medicare in 1984. Since that time, the proportion of Australians maintaining private health cover has plummeted from 50 per cent in June 1984 to a current rate of around 33 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What incentive is there for individuals to maintain voluntary private health cover when our taxpayer&hyphen;funded system is available to all, regardless of income? <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Economist</EMPHASIS>, in its 15 March 1997 edition, argued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The goal of high&hyphen;quality health care for all regardless of income is a noble one, worth defending.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">But it also noted that few people appreciate the true cost of health care. The cost of hospital care and medical technology has continued to soar at a rapid pace. The Productivity Commission confirmed this, saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Inherent&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is, in the Australian health care system&mdash;</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5258">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is a tendency for overuse, where patients receive services which they value at less than the cost of provision.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The existence of a universally available, publicly funded system, which is `free'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">so&hyphen;called&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">at its point of delivery, clearly weakens the incentives for private health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The challenge before the government is not an easy one, but it is a responsibility that it simply cannot shirk. The coalition must begin to change any widely held opinion in the public that health facilities should be available to all regardless of an individual's means. It must engineer alternatives in the provision of equitable and cost&hyphen;effective medical insurance. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Australians need to understand that they must become financially responsible for their own health care wherever possible. One journalist suggested:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no sustainable solution that does not involve people who can afford to do so paying for more of their own health care.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Senior citizens play a vital role in this community. Approximately 25 per cent of all seniors in Western Australia  participate in valuable community and voluntary work. A further 10 per cent are involved in child care, allowing younger Australians to continue in the paid work force. One contributor to the Second Global Conference on Ageing International in 1996 suggested:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The seniors of tomorrow will be different from those of today. They are likely to be healthier, better educated and more financially independent.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">But with private health premiums increasing to levels well in excess of the inflation rate and with declining membership in all private health care funds, we simply cannot be content to rely solely on the greater independence of future Australians. The Institute of Family Studies also noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The earlier retirement of men will have a significant impact on the need for state support of aged people, and with decreased opportunity to accumulate superannuation funds, the state may be called on to provide pension and health support.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Productivity Commission described Australia's health system as `a mosaic of ad hoc and opaque arrangements', and suggested

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I want to talk about two aspects of infrastructure; firstly, as it affects my electorate of Hinkler and, secondly, as it affects rural Australia more widely.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After years of drought and, in my particular area, an indifferent sugar market&mdash;although it is vastly improved on what it used to be&mdash;the need for a reliable and certain water supply is becoming a critical matter in the Northern Wide Bay&hyphen;Burnett area of Queensland. I am talking about the Burnett and Kolan river systems in particular. As you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, Borumba Creek, which feeds the Burnett system, traverses part of your electorate as well. It is a very important river system. It is the second largest coastal river system in Queensland and it has many catchments on it. But, as I said before, we are now reaching a crisis point</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sugar industry is worth about $150 million to Bundaberg alone and perhaps another $40 or $50 million to the Childers area immediately adjoining Bundaberg. In addition, there is a thriving small crop industry, arguably the largest of its kind in Australia, with an annual income of at least $110 million. When you look at that, and then look more widely into that area of Queensland with its cattle, dairy, grain, cotton and citrus industries, you can see that without water the whole area is at risk. It is even sadder to relate that the City of Bundaberg would be inhibited from attracting an industry with an intensive water usage. Something in excess of 500 megalitres a year would pose problems for that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, within the next decade, three of the four local authorities in the area will suffer through lack of water. In addition to that, to the east of Bundaberg there is a serious matter of salt intrusion. It is not the same sort of salt 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5259"> intrusion that you get along the Murray&hyphen;Darling system but, in a way, it is a more insidious one. Once salt water from the ocean is sucked into an aquifer, that aquifer is sterilised for many years to come.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Looking, too, at the dams in that same northern Wide Bay&hyphen;Burnett area of Queensland, which is the southern half of the Hinkler electorate, we find that the Monduran Dam has only 11 per cent capacity, the Wuruma Dam has only 14 per cent capacity and the Cania Dam has 30 per cent capacity. In reality, the Monduran Dam&mdash;which at full capacity effectively runs the Bundaberg irrigation scheme&mdash;has 586,000 megalitres. So, when you get down to 11 per cent of that effective usage, you certainly have a crisis on your hands. In fact, next season, short of a cyclone or something of that nature, Bundaberg's water usage will be reduced to about 30 per cent of normal usage. That is a very worrying situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tonight, I announce my commitment to a major water storage facility being built on the Burnett River at Paradise, which is to the south&hyphen;west of Bundaberg. I propose that the state and federal governments focus on a major water storage facility there worth in the vicinity of $150 million. I know that is a big ask, but it is a very important aspect for the future of that area as one of the key producing areas of Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Queensland state government has a water infrastructure task force operating at present. The state government has committed $1 billion over the next 15 years to water projects. It has done an assessment of these projects throughout the state and prioritised them. Interestingly, when it called for expressions of interest from various parts of the state for $1 billion it got bids totalling $8.3 billion. That is an extraordinary figure. That means that there is seven times the capacity out there. You might argue that some would be wish list projects, but even if a few were I think we could confidently say that four or five times what the state government is prepared to make available is being bid for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That poses the question: have successive governments of both political colours taken enough interest in these projects over recent 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> years? I do not want to be overly political in my speech, but in the 6&half; years of the Goss government, which overlapped the second half of the Hawke and Keating governments, other than the two small dams that were promised in the sugar package not one major water storage facility was devised and commenced in Queensland.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We could rattle off a lot of dams that we put in place over that time such as the Awoonga, the Cania, the Wuruma, the Monduran, the Borumba and the Bjelke&hyphen;Petersen. There were a whole host of dams in Queensland alone. There were dams all over the state. The point I am making&mdash;and I have said that I do not want to be overly political about this&mdash;is that there is a hiatus there and we need to address it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will take my case a bit further. We have seen a reduction in interest rates, a low level of inflation, tax cuts for low and middle income earners and we have had a regime of no increases in income tax, company tax, sales tax or excise over the last two years, yet the economy of that state is still slow. What we need in Australia, and we certainly need in Queensland more widely&mdash;I make this call tonight&mdash;is a national infrastructure fund. I recognise that there is a $1.2 billion Natural Heritage Fund for the restoration of waterways, the reversal of land degradation and other such matters. I recognise that $1 billion has been allocated for the Federation Fund. I commend the government for those funds, but they do not go to the heart of what I am talking about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that if the government is successful in its one-third sale of Telstra and were it to receive, for example, $9 billion or $10 billion rather than the $8 billion that it has budgeted for&mdash;and there is some expectation of that&mdash;that $1 billion should be put aside, as the state government of Queensland did, for a national infrastructure fund. I believe it is important that we start putting things back into the bush and back into regional Australia. For too long there have been no dams. For too long powerhouses were put on the backburner. For too long bridges were allowed to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5260"> deteriorate. For too long new linking roads were ignored.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to get excitement back into this. There is a marvellous scheme that was identified in the Queensland state government's water infrastructure study that involves New South Wales: the Clarence diversion. It will pump the Clarence River across the range into the Condamine and thus feed the Condamine, the Darling and the Murray systems. I think those are the sorts of schemes that Australia should be looking at at present. We need to have dams, powerhouses, roads and bridges.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) is an omnibus taxation bill covering a wide number of matters, many of which were announced in last year's budget. The major issues covered here include superannuation, capital gains tax and a miscellany of other taxation issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to superannuation, the legislation proposes to change the tax arrangements for superannuation in three ways: firstly, granting an exemption from capital gains tax for up to $500,000 for small businesses which use the money for retirement purposes; secondly, allowing a rebate at the rate of 18 per cent for superannuation contributions made on behalf of a low income&mdash;that is to say, under $10,800 a year&mdash;or non-working spouse; and, thirdly, increasing the maximum employee age under which the superannuation guarantee payments must be made by employers from 65 to 70, to be consistent with the rights of employees to continue to contribute to superannuation funds until age 70. We have some concerns about the equity of the first two of these proposals, which I will go through in a moment, but we unequivocally support the third of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate has referred these issues to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation for examination. That committee is yet to report, as I understand it. We will not oppose the measures nor move amendments here in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5261"> this House, but we will decide our final position on the legislation after the process in the other place has been completed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to the small business exemption we do, as I indicated, have concerns about the $500,000 exemption proposal. Those concerns relate to the fairness of this measure. We accept that for many people small business has been the way that they have saved for their retirement. For some people business cash flow needs have precluded the capacity to save regularly, however, in a superannuation fund. In addition, prior to Labor's reform of the reasonable benefits limits, there was a significant bias against small business in superannuation in some circumstances, especially where the businesses were not incorporated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As usual, despite the rhetoric that we so often hear from the coalition, it was Labor that fixed the anomalies that confronted small business, not the coalition. Indeed, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) was the Treasurer, the responsible minister, who presided over the unfair superannuation taxation system that prevailed until Labor came to the party and fixed it up. So despite there having been a problem historically, it is by no means clear that a further large concession is justified. That is what we have a query about; that is what we want the Senate to further explore.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tax, albeit at concessional rates, is payable on superannuation contributions, on fund earnings and, of course, on the final benefits of ordinary employees. What this bill is proposing is to completely exempt from tax a substantial capital gain&mdash;$500,000&mdash;on the conditions only of the age of the recipient and that the funds be used for retirement purposes. What this does accordingly is to provide a massive advantage in tax terms between small business people on the one hand and the great bulk of the Australian community on the other, who are employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The average superannuation fund balance at the moment, and hence the average payout if that were to occur today, is around $38,000. So this proposal, if it were to be enacted, would provide a quite disproportionate benefit relative to the prevailing general community standard. That is to say that an amount around 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 13 times the average superannuation account balance is proposed to be exempt from tax, whereas the much smaller sum, which is the average balance, in ordinary employees' accounts has already faced taxation and probably will face further tax when it is paid out. Why should there not be an equivalent tax regime applying to both employees and small business? Why should the rules disproportionately favour one constituency?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There may be good answers to those questions, but no particularly cogent rationale has been articulated by the government so far. It is essentially a political policy in a similar vein to the latest threat by the government to completely exempt small business from the unfair dismissal laws. That is notwithstanding the fact that the present provision in the unfair dismissal laws allows ample opportunity for effectively probationary periods to be applied to enable a proper assessment to be made of the employee in question, with small business suffering no great disadvantage from the law as it presently operates as a result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another relevant factor to consider in assessing the merits of this particular proposal is the fact that this $500,000 exemption, by definition, applies only to those assets which are covered by the capital gains tax. That is to say, any asset acquired by a small business person prior to 20 September 1985 is exempt from capital gains tax anyway. So it is not true to imply that the current law disproportionately discriminates against small business proprietors who have spent their lives building a business. Any proceeds from the sale of a very longstanding business will be effectively exempt from capital gains tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, Labor has already instituted a benefit for small business&mdash;this is very important to put on the record again&mdash;namely, the 50 per cent exemption from capital gains tax on goodwill up to the value of $2&frac14; million, which currently applies under the capital gains tax system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do stress, while expressing these concerns, that we continue to have an open mind on this issue. But we do want to ensure that what the government is presenting as a fair and reasonable measure is not in fact effectively a rort available to the few but not to the  many. In 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5262"> that context this concession also has to be considered in the light of the capital gains tax rollover relief proposal which is currently before the Senate; that proposes to provide a further significant relaxation of an important part of the tax system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not opposed, I repeat, to clearing away unfair taxation hurdles or burdens. We are certainly not opposed to contemplating the amendment of provisions which do impact negatively on jobs or growth. But we do not want to see the comprehensiveness of the tax base being eroded unjustifiably. As a result, we will look very carefully indeed at these sorts of measures as they come up in turn.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition, it needs to be remembered, have always opposed the fairest measures in our tax system. They fiercely opposed the introduction of the capital gains tax itself. In the past they have expressed a desire, a wish, to repeal it. Contemporary community attitudes, I think, would certainly now preclude full repeal of that measure. Consequently, the government have gone a little more carefully in recent years on this subject than used to be the case. But we, on our side of this House, are wary of attempts to effectively repeal the measure, at least for certain sections of the community, via backdoor means. It is this issue that we want to see fully explored, analysed and discussed by the Senate select committee. We hope very much that the inquiry will do just that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other superannuation measure that I want to much more briefly discuss here is the 18 per cent rebate for superannuation contributions made on behalf of a low income or non&hyphen;working spouse. Again, this measure will be closely examined by the Senate select committee, after which we will finally determine our position. So at this stage my comments are preliminary only. Nonetheless, it is possible to say that the general context of this measure is very instructive when it comes to understanding the focus of this Prime Minister and this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This measure assumes that people are going to have a spare $3,000 to contribute to their spouse's superannuation in situations where that spouse does not work or only works part time. Clearly, the full benefit of this kind of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> proposal will be available, in practice, only to a rather select band of well&hyphen;off people, certainly not to mainstream middle Australia. In that respect I have to say that this proposal mirrors very closely the philosophy of the really quite ludicrous savings rebate that was announced in the recent budget: that rebate which you can only fully enjoy&mdash;$450 thereof&mdash;if you are effectively rich enough not to need it anyway, that rebate which applies moreover notionally in order to encourage savings but it is equally applicable in many situations where you do not save at all and in fact in some cases where you are running down your savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this particular superannuation rebate involves here is a benefit for people who, as I have said, essentially have spare capital lying around. What we would much prefer to see happen in these situations is to provide general assistance which is targeted to assist most those for whom saving is more difficult due to their lower means. So when the Prime Minister talks about helping families he really is, as so often, talking about assisting those families with plenty of money and plenty of investment options. He is not really interested in helping the real battlers who really would materially benefit from being able to save more. That is a recurring theme for this government and it is one that I think needs again a very close and beady&hyphen;eyed look in the context of the evaluation of this measure that will take place in the other place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Moving now, more specifically, to the capital gains tax provisions in this omnibus bill. These are proposals to change the capital gains tax arrangements in a number of respects, including clarifying the rules about capital gains tax on inherited properties, increasing the tax&hyphen;free period to dispose of houses from one year to two and reducing the record keeping requirements which are presently applicable, and enacting anti-avoidance rules covering manipulation of company liquidations and the elimination of anomalies in the loss provisions both for capital and revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These measures are seen by us as reasonable and are not opposed. The amendments here recognise that anomalies can arise where 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5263"> a principal residence is inherited and subsequently disposed of and the consequent need for a more flexible regime governing these kinds of transactions. The need for anti-avoidance provisions indicates precisely why we are concerned about the exemption for retirement purposes that I mentioned previously. Aggressive tax planning is a fact of life and constant vigilance is necessary by governments to keep the tax base sound. We support these sorts of measures as they come before the parliament from time to time and we support the government's measures to tighten the CGT net to address these loss and liquidation problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While we are committed to closing down inadvertent holes in the tax system, allowing a smart few to benefit at the cost of many, I repeat my earlier equal concern that gaping holes not be deliberately inserted into the tax net. Some questions do arise about some of the other provisions in this legislation in that respect, as I have already mentioned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, there is a whole miscellany of what can loosely be described as `other matters' in this particular bill which go to so&hyphen;called anti-avoidance amendments under the research and development provisions which seek to amend the partnership provisions to ensure companies in partnership cannot effectively continue syndicate&hyphen;like operations, which the government has cancelled with effect from July last year. The bill also provides for the disallowance of deductions for syndicates where the syndicate has been granted an extension but has breached a condition of that extension. That is the other major provision in this respect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition does not support the R&amp;D changes which have themselves necessitated the proposals in this bill. We have made clear over and over again that the basic R&amp;D policy adopted by this government is bad for jobs, bad for growth, bad for innovation. The amendments are said to be necessary to fix anomalies in legislation, which was accepted by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) last year and which was known at the time to be flawed. The whole question of R&amp;D and what flows from it in this bill will be dealt with by my colleague the minister for industry and region 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> al development, the member for Hotham (Mr Crean), in his remarks in this debate.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Mr GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The shadow minister. I am glad you are attending so attentively. There are a couple of other small specific matters, however, that do need some further reference. There is a provision in this bill for payments received under the firearms surrender arrangements to be confirmed as tax exempt for recipients other than gun dealers. That is not controversial. We do not oppose it. The gun buyback was a tough but necessary measure which, as everybody ought to appreciate, had the full support of the opposition. Property was compulsorily acquired from citizens. Compensation properly payable as a result under the constitution was paid. It would have been unfair to tax farmers or other gun owners in respect of a disposal they did not undertake voluntarily. Hence, we support this amendment which is to clean up that potential anomaly. However, we also agree with the government's decision to exclude firearms dealers from this concession.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then&mdash;this really is a miscellany&mdash;there is another matter involving technical amendments to the provisions governing the taxation of the sale of mining rights designed to give the Senate's amendment of 12 December last year its intended effect. What is involved here are amendments which are designed to fix up a government&hyphen;Democrat Senate amendment, an amendment which led to people discovering it did not achieve what it was purportedly aimed at, namely, providing a five&hyphen;year grandfathering of gains arising from prospectors disposing of their prospecting rights. My colleague the shadow minister for resources and energy, the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith), will be discussing this matter in further detail. He will be moving some amendments to reflect the opposition's position on this particular matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there are some technical amendments to the family tax assistance for taxpayers with exempt foreign income. I will come back to the family tax assistance question when I come in a moment to the other bill in this cognate debate. As to this particular measure, we do not oppose it, but it is to be noted that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5264"> we are already seeing complex amendments to the family tax assistance initiative coming forward only a few months after it has commenced. That says something, I suppose, for the quality of the government's planning and implementation of this measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other measures in the bill about which no specific comment is necessary, and certainly no objection is expressed by us, involve technical amendments to the depreciation provisions which will allow a lessor of an item of plant or equipment to be treated as the owner for tax purposes. The franking credits of taxable companies formerly owned by tax exempt entities will be cancelled when they cease to be owned by those tax exempt entities to ensure that a windfall does not accrue to the new owners. That is fair enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, housing fringe benefits provided by primary producers in remote areas are to be made exempt from fringe benefits tax from 1 April. We have no problem with that. Certain items used in telephone exchanges will not be considered to be electrical fittings and, hence, will not be exempt from wholesale sales tax. I understand that this amendment is to overcome a recent court decision which was adverse to the revenue and which is necessary to protect the wholesale sales tax base, and that is a good thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I think I ought to point to, summarising one effect of all these extraordinary miscellany of matters, is that this particular piece of legislation does add in itself quite significantly to the complexity of the tax system. This bit of legislation alone adds about another 100 pages to the tax body of legislation. This, combined with the other several hundred pages of tax legislation currently before the parliament, shows I think the complete hypocrisy of the coalition on the question of the increasing complexity and volume of tax legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We used to be criticised incessantly by the coalition in this respect. Suddenly, when they are in power, we&mdash;surprise, surprise&mdash;no longer hear the point mentioned at all. It is probably an endemic characteristic of the tax system as we presently know it, but we had hoped we might have been spared a little bit 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of the hypocrisy which is so endemic in the behaviour of the coalition in these matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All that said, let me now come to the other bill in the package, the Income Tax Rates Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1997. This deals with only one issue, mercifully, and that is the rates of income tax applying to individuals. But the bill becomes necessary because of the ridiculously complex design of the so-called family tax assistance, FTA. It was previously known as the family tax initiative; now it is FTA. Instead of paying family assistance only by way of the social security system, the Prime Minister has insisted upon the introduction of a hybrid model with tax concessions as well as direct payments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are significant problems with this kind of delivery system. These are compounded by the actual design of the tax concession. Instead of granting a rebate&mdash;that is, a reduction in the tax payable&mdash;as applies in other areas of tax assistance relating to family situations such as that provided for spouses and housekeepers and invalid relatives, the FTA, family tax assistance, delivers its benefits by increasing the tax-free threshold for eligible parents. The threshold is lifted in this way by $1,000 for each child and by a further $2,500 where any child is under five. So, for a breadwinner with only one child who is under five, their tax-free threshold rises from $5,400 to $8,900.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This design has introduced further complex legislation into the tax rates legislation. This parliament passed a complex bill last year. We have this further bill this year and, as well, there are further amendments in the No. 3 bill, which I have already talked about. This is all before any tax returns have been lodged by the general public who have to try to understand this legislation and who face severe penalties if they overclaim their entitlements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tax profession is very concerned indeed about this complexity in the particular context of the family tax assistance measures. By a fortunate coincidence, if I might so describe it, today's debate coincides with the release today of this year's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tax Pack</EMPHASIS>, of course being the annual guide produced by the Taxation Office to assist taxpayers to fill in their 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5265"> returns correctly. It is a very worthy public service introduced by Labor to assist taxpayers to comply with the law and to claim their full entitlements, and I certainly do not want to criticise the Taxation Office in any way for this year's effort. By definition, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tax Pack</EMPHASIS> is hostage to the complexity of the law which it has to deal with and describe and explain. Poor long&hyphen;suffering taxpayers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Examining this year's publication shows for the first time the complexity and intrusiveness of the so-called family tax assistance. The section on FTA is item 49 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tax Pack</EMPHASIS>, and it goes from page 116 through to page 125. So the new tax concession runs to 10 pages of explanatory material in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tax Pack</EMPHASIS>. By way of comparison, I point out that item 39, which deals with contributions to superannuation funds and receipt of a superannuation annuity or pension&mdash;both highly complex matters&mdash;only amounts to three pages of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tax Pack</EMPHASIS>. So there is a little bit of a story there. It is for this reason that accountants and tax advisers are becoming increasingly concerned about family tax assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this context, I would like to focus on some recent comments of Mr Ray Regan, the President of the National Tax and Accountants Association. He said, in a press release on 26 May:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tax Pack</EMPHASIS>  1997 . . . has two serious problems. The most concerning being that a gigantic 10 pages will be dedicated to explaining just one single issue, being the Family Tax Initiative. Taxpayers will be absolutely shocked and horrified to go through the ridiculous, complex and confusing calculation [and] information requirements that will affect up to one million families in receipt of the Government's Family Tax Initiative. The Tax Office already knows taxpayers will get it wrong and will be closely watching their claims ready to take action.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is about as damning as any criticism possibly can be. Understandably, given the ferocity of this attack, the tax office, also on 26 May, released its own press statement which claimed, among other things, that Mr Regan's claims `simply amount to scaremongering'. The NTAA then responded with a very revealing release on 28 May. This release claimed that a senior Australian Tax Office executive, Mr Mobbs, had confided the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> real views of the tax office on the FTA to the Treasurer in writing. This advice reputedly included that the tax office thought that the scheme `is too complex for ordinary taxpayers'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, Mr Regan claims that Mr Mobbs had confided to him that, if the tax office pursued this line too hard, they would `get a kick in the backside from the government' and `he was well aware that there were many problems with the FTA legislation'. Mr Mobbs other reputed criticisms include that the tax assistance should have been paid solely through the social security system&mdash;damning criticism, one might have thought, of the centrepiece of the government's election campaign&mdash;and that the rules for separated couples were so complex that `it would be worth while for separated couples to grab a bottle of champagne and get together one more time on 30 June rather than working through the family tax initiative maze'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The inevitable result of these complexities will be errors and, consequently, the question of penalties being imposed on taxpayers will arise. Apparently, the ATO is to institute a policy of no penalties to be imposed for 1997. We welcome that move, if it is correct, but we note that this shows an extraordinarily badly designed concession being introduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mentioned before that the provisions are not only complex and confusing, as they unquestionably are, as any honourable member will see from looking at those pages themselves, but they also are very intrusive. Page 123 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tax Pack</EMPHASIS> contains the 1997 family agreement. This agreement is further paperwork which has to be filled in by hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of estranged parents. The agreement is not to be attached to the tax return but has to be kept for five years. Taxpayers will be liable to losing their FTA if they do not keep a copy of this little filled&hyphen;in form or if they inadvertently misplace it. In addition, a new agreement has to be filled in every year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all know that there are many parents who, to say the least, are not on civil terms and who do not cooperate together very well. This basic fact of life seems to have been overlooked in the design of the agreement, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5266"> which requires the signature of both the person claiming the tax concession and the other party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As one would expect, the opposition&mdash;and I will conclude on this note&mdash;was interested in exploring these important matters in that parliamentary forum under which the government purports to be accountable in respect of matters of administrative detail&mdash;namely, the Senate estimates process. Unfortunately, when Labor senators raised this issue, they were informed that Mr Mobbs had injured himself and could not attend the hearings. I am sorry if Mr Mobbs is still suffering in this respect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question was then put to Senator Kemp who one would assume, as minister assisting the Treasurer, would have received a copy of the tax office advice to the Treasurer on the shortcomings of the family tax assistance arrangements. But, as usual, Senator Kemp's answers provided absolutely no information whatsoever, leading the opposition to conclude either that he had received a copy of the advice but had not read it, or that he had read it and did not understand it&mdash;either entirely plausible, knowing Senator Kemp as well as I do. Either way, the excuse was then proffered that the matter was then subject to legal action and should not be further discussed. When the opposition then pursued details of this claimed legal action, the minister then started referring to potential legal action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, the government is embarrassed by the complexity and the unworkability of its major policy initiative in the last budget, the 1996 budget. This complexity will become increasingly well known in the community; it will come back to haunt the government. That said, having wended my weary way through this endlessly complex bit of legislation, that is the opposition's position on these matters. On the particular issues of which I spoke relating, in particular, at the outset to the various superannuation provisions, we will reserve our position until we see what comes out of the Senate inquiry.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In listening to the speech of the shadow Treasurer and Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1997, I might re

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To say that there is an objection to an income tax is only to say that this tax is a tax. For the ingenuity of the human mind never did and never will devise a tax to which there are not objections more than plausible and which would be absolutely convincing and irresistible if taxation were not a necessity.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think the ALP objections fall into that category. We have heard some very plausible arguments but, essentially, they are arguments around the margin. I notice that in the Senate committee which was examining this bill, the ALP, in principle, does support the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill will be good for small business. In speaking in favour of this bill, I recall that it was Cardinal John Henry Newman who said that prayer was a sharp edged tool. In addressing the issue of small business and jobs, there can be little doubt that, like Cardinal Newman's view of prayer, taxation acts as a sharp edged tool.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As stated recently by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), if we are interested in the long term and are serious about creating jobs in this country, we ought to ask ourselves whether or not the present tax system promotes the creation of jobs&mdash;in other words, tax reform that is pro&hyphen;jobs and tax reform which supports small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill relates to election commitments, budget announcements from last year's budget and decisions which have been announced by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in 1996.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the key initiatives this government has announced is to allow eligibility for capital gains tax rollover relief where taxpayers sell their business assets or shares in the company operating the business and the  proceeds are reinvested in upgrading the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5267"> existing business or in another small business. Another initiative by the government was its announcement that it would extend the capital gains tax exemption on the sale of a small business where the proceeds are used for retirement. This measure has also been extended to apply to private companies and trusts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments to the new capital gains tax retirement exemption provisions for taxpayers disposing of small business assets are contained in schedule 1 of the bill that we are debating. Essentially, the amendments will allow taxpayers to ignore years prior to the 1992-93 financial year of income when working out the period that the taxpayer was a controlling owner&hyphen;employee, providing it is favourable to the taxpayer to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason for this amendment is so that the exemption measure will be in line with the five-year period generally required under the record keeping provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. This amendment will reduce compliance costs for this measure in so far as taxpayers will not be required to establish that they are a controlling owner&hyphen;employee where they have not kept records beyond their five-year period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While prayer may be a sharp edged tool and taxation may be a sharp edged tool, there is no doubt that in the hands of the young turks of the Labor Party taxation is positively a lethal weapon; a weapon aimed at the Daleks or the old Keating ministers that are politely but dismissively termed old  Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In cutting the painter with old Labor, the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) has quite sensibly embraced the Prime Minister's call to review the nation's existing taxation system. On a day&hyphen;by&hyphen;day basis, the member for Melbourne has embarrassed and is embarrassing the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) by speaking the truth. He has warned the Daleks or the old Hawke-Keating government ministers in his party against recycling the policies of the 1950s and defining themselves by what they do not like. Quite correctly, he states that, if the Daleks adopt the policies of the 1950s, the ALP will 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> be virtually indistinguishable from Pauline Hanson on economic issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The views of the member for Melbourne on research and development seem to mirror the Treasurer's views&mdash;namely, where you start introducing concessions into the income tax system, as was happening in relation to R&amp;D syndication, you put a lot of interest into the area, and experience shows you that the interest gets more tax aggressive over time. He quite rightly recognises the link between racism and economic nostalgia of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson), and quite rightly he does not want a bar of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To the casual observer, the member for Melbourne's detailed submission to his party's living standards and employment policy committee&mdash;which is helping to draft Labor's new policy platform&mdash;was nothing more than a genuine attempt by one of the shadow ministers to help stimulate internal discussion on tax reform. At least that is what the Leader of the Opposition would like the public to think. It is, however, common knowledge that the member for Melbourne is an ambitious man. He is renowned in union circles as being the one who got rid of the Santamaria boys in the Federated Clerks Union&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to return to the relationship between taxation and unemployment. Last week we  witnessed a slight increase in the official 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5268"> unemployment rate to 8.8 per cent. Members of this House will recall the television advertisements that the former government had during Working Nation. In one of the ads we had Bill Hunter, the rugged quintessential Aussie bloke, trooping around a factory site in his set of King Gees telling us that the other actors in the advert were job ready. There was only one problem&mdash;no jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a paper published in September last year entitled `Divided nation: employment and unemployment in Australia' Graeme Dorrance and Helen Hughes, reflecting on the Hawke&hyphen;Keating legacy, documented amongst others the following statistics. Long&hyphen;term unemployment grew to 37 per cent in 1993. Youth unemployment represented 40 per cent of total employment, although the 15 to 24 age group accounts for only 20 per cent of the population aged 15 years and over. Of most concern was the author's following statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The re&hyphen;emergence of high unemployment in Australia has been accompanied by widening income distribution and worsening poverty. Australia is now a divided nation: whereas 85 per cent of the workforce re employed and living well as `insiders', 15 per cent are unemployed, underemployed or disguised unemployed and poor `outsiders' concentrated in low socio&hyphen;economic status neighbourhoods marked by low labour force participation, high unemployment, poor educational achievement and poor health. An underclass is growing as unemployment levels rise with each cyclical downturn. Unless fundamental policy changes are made speedily, the insider proportion of Australians could be reduced to 80 per cent, leaving 20 per cent, or one person in five, to be poor outsiders.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There can be little doubt that unemployment is the most debilitating of all social conditions. Regressive in nature, unemployment saps the spirit and works against hope. Last year a constituent of Boothby wrote to me with various suggestions aimed at reducing unemployment. Talented, experienced, educated, fit and healthy, unfortunately this man, like so many other men and women, had found himself unemployed in the middle of his life. In a letter to me he wrote the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Until I actually experienced it, I could not have believed the extent of mental and physical damage that results from unemployment. We become what we are popularly perceived to be; stupid, worthless, useless, bedraggled, lethargic, debt ridden and hopeless.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is well documented that the social consequences of unemployment and poverty include illness, family break&hyphen;up, declining standards of education, alcoholism, drug abuse and crime. Before dinner, I was speaking about a letter I had received from a constituent of mine. Of the many ideas and suggestions that he raised, the most interesting touched on the need for taxation reform.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In calling for a fundamental shake&hyphen;up of the tax system, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has outlined the three benchmarks he has established for reform&mdash;namely, that any change must aid jobs growth, boost exports and produce greater incentives to invest and to save. The Prime Minister has said that the current tax system acts as a disincentive to personal effort and contains heavy sanctions against middle income earners because of the high rates of marginal tax. For example, 40 years ago you paid the top marginal rate of personal tax when your income was 14 times the average weekly earnings. You now pay that when you income is 1&half; times the average weekly earnings. Quite clearly, that is an unsustainable position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In looking at this omnibus bill, which includes measures that were election commitments or announced in the budget last year or announced by the Treasurer in the 1996 year, it is worth reflecting on the opposition's approach to tax reform. The old war horses&mdash;the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans)&mdash;must be wondering what happened to them in their dotage. When they were the Young Turks, nothing was too difficult&mdash;floating the exchange rate or deregulating the financial system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at tax and the taxation summit of 1985, when Keating with his famous option C was going to give us a broad based consumption tax of, I think, about 12&half; per cent, who was supporting him in the cabinet? Paul Kelly tells us in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The End of Certainty</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Only Hawke, Evans, Beazley and Susan Ryan supported Keating's position. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5269">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Why take Paul Kelly's word for it. John Edwards in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Man, the Myth, the Record&mdash;Keating: The Inside Story </EMPHASIS> told us also:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . firm supporters included only Hawke, Kim Beazley and Gareth Evans.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So old Labor, when they were the Young Turks, supported tax reform as well. It is important to note that this bill is good for small business. I cannot imagine that there will be too much opposition to the belief that the only prospect a technology based society has of achieving full employment depends on a government nurturing and encouraging a healthy environment for small business. This government is working hard in that area. In responding to the 62 recommendations of the small business deregulation task force that the Prime Minister established last year, it should be acknowledged that the government has already delivered the reform of unfair dismissal laws and an environment where low inflation and lower interest rates are the norm.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the key findings of the small business deregulation task force was that small businesses with one or two employees spend an average 120 hours a year on tax matters. That rises to about 250 hours for businesses with more than 10 employees. In concert with reducing the provisional tax uplift factor from eight per cent to six per cent and agreeing to set up a new small taxation claims tribunal, the government's initiatives in the area of capital gains tax are a positive step forward in reducing the number of those who are unemployed. This omnibus bill will benefit small business and make it fairer for those who rollover their businesses. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1997 is, as my colleague the member for Boothby (Dr Southcott) points out, is an omnibus taxation bill that does cover a wide number of areas. The issues which I am specifically concerned about looking at tonight go very much to the area that he last touched upon&mdash;that is, small business and the capital gains tax exemption, the disposal of small business assets on retirement and the proposals contained here within the legislation. </PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is important, just in passing, to pick up a comment that was made by our colleague in respect of unfair dismissals on small businesses and the recommendations that were contained in the Bell committee's report on small business and how to respond to that. It is fair to say, I think&mdash;and I wish the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) would start to acknowledge this&mdash;that the Bell committee report said that the government's industrial relations laws, enacted only towards the end of last year, needed time to be bedded down to see what their effect would be on small business. In fact, their recommendation was that there be no changes for a period of at least 12 months and that a further review occur after that 12-month period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, that simply has not happened because there was one crisis or another facing this government. The Prime Minister chose one of the Channel 9 shows to go on and, once again, with a great bit of diversion, ran the old crisscross move and decided to throw up the idea that they were going to exempt small business from the unfair dismissal laws. He made the announcement that businesses of, I think, less than 15 employees were going to be exempt from the provisions of the unfair dismissal legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I again point out that it was the government's, the Prime Minister's, own unfair dismissal legislation&mdash;not the former legislation of the former government, but this government's unfair dismissal legislation&mdash;as it impacts on small business. The Prime Minister went on a Channel 9 program and, from memory, announced that this would apply to businesses of less than 15 employees and that there would be a 12-month grace period in which they would be exempt from those provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That said, and going against the recommendations of the Bell committee, he went a step further&mdash;again, another crisis facing the government, and I cannot recall which one it was as there have been so many in recent times&mdash;and announced that not only would it apply to the small businesses that I have just described but it would now apply to all small businesses.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5270">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sorry the honourable member for Boothby has dashed off to his party meeting to consider taxation and other important issues&mdash;issues that probably should be debated here in the parliament, not simply in a closed shop party meeting of the Liberal and National parties&mdash;but the member for Boothby did mention that the unfair dismissal laws themselves were going to be a great boon to small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Bell committee did not want that. They recommended there be no change until such time as the industrial relations laws of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) and the Prime Minister, which came into effect towards the end of last year, took immediate effect and there could be some measured outcomes. In fact, as I have been pointing out and as my colleague the honourable member for Canberra (Mr McMullan), the shadow minister for industrial relations, has been pointing out in this place, if you look at recent statistics you find that the level of actions being carried forward into the Australian Industrial Relations Commission involving involuntary separations on a monthly basis have fallen dramatically since the enactment of the legislation by this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the rush forward by the Prime Minister&mdash;as one of the great classic diversionary tactics that he used to try to deflect people's interest away from other problems facing his government&mdash;clearly is something which may, in fact, not work. As I have indicated, whilst there are still some concerns in the small business community about the actual statistics on how important it is in terms of actions being taken, it would seem that it is becoming smaller.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Boothby touched on another issue under the guise of this need for genuine tax reform. He started to talk about option C and raised the vexed question of a consumption tax&mdash;therefore, a goods and services tax&mdash;and the implications of that for small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker Hollis, you and I both know about this, because we were here in 1993. We were here when the arguments were raised by Dr John Hewson, the then Leader of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Opposition, about what he was proposing to put in place with another massive change for the Australian public in a variety of areas with Fightback. One of the components contained in that&mdash;a central part of it&mdash;was the issue of a goods and services tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was the complexity of that particular tax which at the time became so confusing for even the good Dr John to explain to the people of Australia. Who can forget his appearances on Ray Martin&mdash;he who must be obeyed&mdash;when confronted with questions on when the tax was paid on ingredients going into cakes? He was not able to clearly explain to the people of Australia, particularly those who watched that show, how it would work. Consequently, that saw his ratings tumble and, of course, the success of the Labor Party in winning what has been described as the unwinnable election and certainly Dr John losing the unlosable election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The GST and its effect on small business at the time in 1993 was said to be one which would make every small business in Australia the tax collectors of the government. In any of this debate that comes out from the government's party room discussions tonight, from any discussion papers which subsequently emerge, from any decision that may or may not be taken to set up another Wallis type inquiry into the broad issue of taxation reform&mdash;which clearly will embrace the GST or VAT or some other consumption tax type of arrangement&mdash;I would like to see clearly spelt out just how this will impact in the area of small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Will it be, as the case in 1993 clearly demonstrated, a taxation measure which would make tax collectors of every small business in Australia? If it is going to, what will that do to the Prime Minister's promise to cut red&hyphen;tape compliance hours, which small business people have to put in in the paper warfare that was identified by the Prime Minister as the major problem facing small business?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would seem to me that it will be no small task for people from the Australian Taxation Office, for people from Treasury and for people from Finance to actually model that particular issue to an extent that assurances 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5271"> will be able to be given to the small business constituency of Australia&mdash;the major employer in this country&mdash;that they will not be tax collectors on behalf of the government and, therefore, their compliance costs and the time spent in filling out forms and doing complex calculations on when the GST may or may not apply and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I look forward, as I am sure many of us on this side of the House do, to what comes out of tonight's discussion in the Liberal&hyphen;National Party caucus meeting, because I think we will get at least the bare bones of a proposal from the Prime Minister and certainly the Deputy Prime Minister, the Leader of the National Party, (Mr Tim Fischer). I saw him on TV this evening being very effusive about a GST and talking about sunrises and how it was going to be the dawn of a new era and all the rest of it&mdash;as only, of course, the Deputy Prime Minister can talk. I think the Treasurer is in the cart as well although, having been bruised rather severely last time he was in a cart or at least in the car industry debate&mdash;</PARA>

The photograph of him on the front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  a week or so ago was one of the great photographs that captured the moment so perfectly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I indicated, it is the issue of the capital gains tax arrangements for small business that is of great concern to me and which I wish to spend a couple of moments making some comments about. The legislation proposes to change the capital gains tax arrangements in a number of respects, including clarifying the rules about the capital gains tax on inherited properties, increasing the tax free period for the disposal of houses from one year to two years, reducing record keeping requirements presently applicable, and enacting anti&hyphen;avoidance rules covering manipulation of company liquidations and the elimination of anomalies in the lost provisions&mdash;both capital and revenue. We have taken a view that these are measures which are reasonable and should be supported. Therefore, I think no further 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> comment necessarily on that aspect is required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also implements the government's election commitment to allow small business taxpayers to claim an exemption from tax on capital gains made on the disposal of some or all of their active business assets if the proceeds are used for retirement. Again, on the face of it, we have no great concern about that specific issue, save for concerns that have been raised more generally about compliance, the way in which this might be put in place, how businesses would respond and whether or not the benefit that would flow is genuine or otherwise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My attention has been drawn to an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of Tuesday, 13 May 1997 under the headline `Accountants decry tax exemption bill'. I am sure that the officials who are with us this evening would be aware of some of those comments that have been made. But, specifically, the Association of Taxation and Management Accountants said in that article:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recently introduced legislation for the small business retirement tax exemption makes the exemption so difficult to use that it becomes only a "smoke and mirrors" illusion, and barely worth having.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The article goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the exemption was strictly limited to two controlling individuals, each with a 50 per cent legal and equitable interest in the business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Once others became involved the exemption was lost.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is according to the legal advice for these accountants. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But it was common to have couples and other family members swapping shifts in businesses with extended hours, such as fruit shops, flower shops, cafes and restaurants.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think many people would agree that that is the case&mdash;family businesses are run along those lines, particularly where children are involved. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most of the farming businesses run by ageing parents and their grown children would also lose out on the exemption . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is according to Mr Nick Petroulias, a solicitor and ATMA director. He also said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5272">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also disqualifies family companies that have given shares to employees, as part of a staffing incentive scheme, and requires that all the cash from the sale be received within two years&mdash;so ruling out most forms of vendor finance.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .       . . .      . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another technical problem . . . was the fact that there seemed to be no method of limiting the exemption to $500,000 a person&mdash;if the sale price was more than that, the exemption was lost entirely.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">According to the Association of Taxation and Management Accountants, all the above problems I have just alluded to and others concerning trust structures made the exemption difficult to use in practice. All of these are important issues for consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope that the Treasurer or, indeed, the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles), who introduced the second reading speech of this legislation, takes those particular concerns on board because the benefit which was announced by the government was greeted by sections of the small business community as being something real, something tangible and something that they welcomed. I hope that their hopes&mdash;as has been the case on so many occasions with the promises and the rhetoric that come out from the Prime Minister, particularly on small business&mdash;will be matched by the reality of the circumstances as a result of the passage of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other issues which have been listed in the second reading speech have received some comment by my friend and colleague the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) earlier today and require nothing further from me. I simply say again to the government that this legislation is something which we will support through this place. We believe that some of the elements associated with superannuation need further examination. I understand we have indicated that we would like the superannuation committee of the Senate to look at that in a little more detail before the bill is finally given passage through the other place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the main, the promise of some relief on retirement for small business people is an appropriate response. We just hope, as I have said, that the issues raised by the Association 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of Taxation and Management Accountants can be addressed and that the bill itself does everything, promises everything and actually delivers everything to the small business constituency of this nation. I wish the bill speedy passage through this place.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight in support of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3), which is about tax reform. We have just disrupted a major party meeting based on tax reform. At least this government is doing something to address tax reform. It is a change to see something being done about our tax acts. They are incredibly complex and incredibly diverse. Recently small businesses in my electorate have been badly done by as a result of the complexity of the tax system. It is important to do what we can to remedy this and it would certainly be a lot easier with bipartisan support. So the onus for tax reform goes back to the opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are certainly hampered in the Senate in anything that we try to do. Our government is clearly focused on small businesses and on creating jobs, reducing unemployment and looking after families&mdash;issues which we took to the electorate in the March 1996 election, and which we are still totally focused on at this stage of our term in parliament. I stress that it is our first term in parliament. But we are not legislating for one term; we are legislating for the long term. We have a vision about things, which is why it is necessary to discuss tax reform and to at least attempt to implement changes even if they have little or no hope of passing the Senate. That is important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) identified early in this term that the key elements for any reduction in unemployment and any improvement in the prospects of small business were a good percentage of growth in the economy, industrial relations reform and, of course, tax reform. We have some industrial relations reforms that we could pass with the Democrats in the Senate. We have very healthy growth figures coming through and we are quite optimistic that this term we will 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5273"> make the estimated 3.75 growth figure. It may be slightly higher than that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last issue of tax reform is something that we are looking at today. It is necessary to look at tax reform because it acts as an incentive. The owner of a small business in my electorate came into my office the other day and said, `Listen, Jackie, five years ago I used to employ 30 people. Today there is just my partner and me. Do you know that we are still taking home the same pay that we did five years ago? We now have more time to spend with our families. When I employed 30 people, I used to spend the weekends looking for work to keep them employed, hunting down contracts here and there to keep them employed.' He said that he spent two days a week administering various wages, legislation requirements, red tape, tax exemptions and rebates in order to qualify for the same pay packet that he and his partner take home every week&mdash;and they gave it away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The loss of productivity, the loss of incentive, really reduced the small business sector to the sorry state it was on 2 March. Given the constraints in the Senate and given the pitiful state of the economy that we were left with, we are doing something to put that incentive back. One of those measures is exemption from capital gains tax for small business. That is essential because in today's world, with increasing technology and very fast moving information services, small businesses need to reinvest their earnings to sustain growth. Whatever profit they make has to be reinvested in the business to increase their productivity to keep them competitive in order to keep them profitable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today if businesses stand still and do not look at increasing opportunities and new technology that is coming through, they may very well find themselves in trouble, as happened with a firm recently. For its sales, it relied solely on the classic camera that we all recognise and failed to get the franchise to sell digital cameras which are coming on line. Digital cameras need no film. They can be downloaded by an amateur photographer onto his CD and be printed off on a colour printer. The quality is better than most holiday snaps taken to any developing agency. That is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> something that is happening in the industry. If you are not aware of that and you do not react and invest quite heavily with that technology in your own business and your own future, you face job losses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem facing small businesses today is that they cannot stand still: they need to reinvest their profits just to stay profitable and to increase their productivity so that they can always compete globally as well as in the domestic market. Having done that, what has small business left in the kitty to invest in superannuation? That is the plight a lot of small businesses find themselves in today, and it is something that we are addressing with this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is some relief in sight for small business owners who invest in their own future and in jobs in their businesses. They can now claim a capital gains tax exemption, which will give them a nice handy lump sum with which to retire. That is really going to benefit thousands of small businesses in Australia and, more particularly, the small businesses in my electorate of Lindsay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My electorate is made up largely of small, family&hyphen;run businesses, including retail, car repair industries and trucking. We do not have substantial numbers of public servants or other people reliant on the taxpayer funded dollar. That is an interesting statistic because unemployment in my electorate, despite last week's figures, has actually gone down and there has been a four per cent reduction in the number of job seekers receiving newstart allowance. When you put that figure against those of Mount Druitt, Blacktown and Parramatta, it is obvious that we are doing quite well out in the Penrith area and I think it is also important when you put it up against performances in Western Australia and Tasmania which have done exceptionally well. We also have the added handicap in New South Wales of Bob Carr and his government running the state into deficit, causing industrial relations complexities and other similar nightmares.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important when introducing any legislation like this that we make it quite clear to the Australian Taxation Office that there is no provision for them to override the intention of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5274"> this parliament later on. We do not want to see the scheme become a bottom&hyphen;of&hyphen;the&hyphen;harbour tax avoidance mechanism but we certainly do want it to address the concerns and legitimate claims of the small businesses which it is intended to benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When major tax incentives like this are introduced, it is important that the tax office complies with the spirit of the law especially when a small business is trying as hard as it can to comply with the letter of the law. In my electorate we do not have high participation in tertiary education. We have a lot of trades, a lot of retail workers and a lot of people who are working very hard&mdash;12 hours a day, six days a week&mdash;who do not put aside time to study the five volumes of the tax act. In fact, most accountants are finding that particular practice  becoming increasingly complex and hard to deal with. The small businesses in my electorate do not have the wherewithal to address all the compliance requirements in order to comply with tremendously complex taxation measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given the intention of this parliament, it is important that the tax office recognises when a legitimate small business has complied as best they can with the letter of the law. The tax office, as a point of administrative practice, should not be seeking to defeat our government's policy and objectives by adopting pedantic, uncommercial and overly technical interpretations of the law, especially where there is a fair and reasonable alternative interpretation available. I think that will address most of the concerns that the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) had about this particular tax incentive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A classic example of this occurred recently with J.K. Williams, a contracting firm in my area, who took advantage of the investment allowance which was introduced by the previous government to give an incentive to invest and to create jobs. Rather than buying a second&hyphen;hand piece of machinery, they invested in a brand new piece of machinery and created a number of jobs but, after a 13&hyphen;week audit of their premises, one minor technicality was found. When they requested an independent review, they were told that it had already been done before they were 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> notified. This supposedly independent review is not recorded on paper anywhere. It is not done by anyone outside the tax office. It sounds like the auditor simply walked the piece of paper over to another fellow in his own department and said, `Here, what do you think of this?' and he said, `Yeah, she'll be right, mate' and now a small business in my electorate is faced with a tax bill they had not counted on in circumstances where they quite clearly were seeking to take advantage of a tax rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The laws are incredibly complex and incredibly crippling to small business and I think that, when you are trying your darnedest to comply with the law, some reference back to the objective and the reason parliament introduced the law should be taken account of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that, I am missing a greater part of tonight's debate in our party room on tax reform. I imagine it will be lively, with a number of proposals being put forward. All of that of course depends on the opposition and especially on the attitude in the Senate of the Democrats, the Independents and the Greens. I do not think tax reform is something that should become party political. It should be something that is realistic, looks after the best interests of our constituents and seeks to benefit them. As I said, in my electorate we do not overly&hyphen;avail ourselves of tertiary institutions and we are not all tax experts. I think it is appalling when small businesses&mdash;especially those just run by Mum and Dad or maybe a few employees&mdash;are asked to comply with requirements that BHP would probably employ five or six specialists to deal with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other issues raised in this bill are of interest especially to my electorate and one which is very significant is the taxation relief that is going to be given to payments under the firearms surrender arrangements. I think it is important for a number of people in my electorate who have surrendered their firearms to know that the proceeds will not be classified as income and they will not be taxed on them. This is also applicable to gun shop owners, of which I have a few in my electorate. Their compensation for loss of income in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5275"> relation to trading stock will not be taxable  and payments they have received for the loss of business caused by the prohibition of certain firearms will also be exempt. It is important that we do give that relief so that we do not tie ourselves up in complex Treasury situations where we are taxing with one hand just to give back with another. We should leave that alone in terms of compensation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other important issue is the ability for people to contribute to superannuation until they are 70 years of age. We have already passed through this House a bill to allow an incentive for people in pensionable circumstances. Instead of retiring at age 65 to go on a pension, people are entitled to work until they are 70 and claim a larger lump sum rather than go on a pension. I think that is very important, given the number of lively aged people in my electorate. Age is not a disability, and it is clearly wrong to lump aged care in with disability. Most of the aged in my electorate are fairly lively characters. They perceive themselves as being quite capable people who are able to work until age 70, if not beyond. Given that people of pensionable age are allowed to work until age 70, I think it is important that those who are eligible to receive a pension be given the option of working until age 70 and continuing to contribute to superannuation. That is an important amendment that has come about through this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other amendment is particularly important for females in my electorate, given that I have a disproportionately high number of females between the ages of 18 and 45 in my electorate&mdash;it is one of the highest numbers for that group in Australia. We all know that tends to be the child bearing age. Basically, we have a population of young families and first home buyers. A lot of younger women, as is the trend today, take time out of their career, their working life, to have children and then they move back into their career. If while you are having children you earn up to about $200 a week, then you are entitled to have your spouse pay superannuation contributions for you for the time you take out to have children. That is a boon for females. It 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is such an advance for my electorate. It recognises the way that females are choosing to structure their careers. This government is to be congratulated on coming up with incentives such as this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a tax rebate of up to $540 or 18 per cent of the contributions made on behalf of the non&hyphen;working spouse. By and large, that will tend to be the female in the child raising years. It means that females who go back to work when their kids are off their hands are not disadvantaged by entering the work force when they are 35 or 40 and starting out with superannuation from scratch. From the start of their working life, at 18 or earlier, they are able to contribute to super and keep those payments going throughout their working lives. That is important for the independence of females and for their ability to make lifestyle choices that suit them. It is indicative of the demands by females on society today. Young females like me want the lot: we want a family, we want a career and we want superannuation prospects that are equivalent to if not greater than the superannuation prospects of males in commensurate jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is certainly omnibus legislation. It is important in a number of aspects. One aspect is the capital gains exemption for principal residences or houses which are inherited from families. Previously there was a 12&hyphen;month disposal limit within which you had to claim that exemption. That has proved to be very dysfunctional, and this government is extending it to 24 months. Again, we are dealing with people who are not tax experts. When you are busy with a family, busy with settling up an estate, busy dealing with a funeral and busy grieving, it is very easy to overlook the tax liabilities. It is unfortunate if, when you do that, you suddenly miss out on an exemption that you are entitled to. That extension to two years certainly makes it a lot easier on families disposing of real estate assets bequeathed to them in wills. That is another amendment that should be endorsed by this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Overall, this legislation has given a number of significant boosts to the small businesses, families and unemployed in my electorate. We have nothing to lose and everything to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5276"> gain by this sort of legislation and this sort of  incentive from a very in touch, caring, considerate and compassionate government. It has been a long time coming, and we certainly have a long way to go. We are here for a long time. I hope that when I go to join the discussions in my party room at the end of this speech we do come up with some proposals that will provide further incentives for the small business industry and provider further hope for our youth and our unemployed. I hope that they will meet with the same consideration from the opposition as this legislation has as we proceed to reform Australia's tax laws. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening I would like to restrict myself to the provisions of the legislation which deal with schedule 2&mdash;the sale of mining rights. I do that, in a sense, in two capacities: firstly, as a member for Western Australia&mdash;the gold and minerals industry is of significant importance to the Western Australian economy, and that, of course, has an impact nationally&mdash;and, secondly, in my capacity as shadow minister for resources and energy. My colleague the shadow treasurer, the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans) went through the other provisions of the legislation, outlined to the House those areas of concern to the opposition and expressed our view in those respects. So I propose, as I have indicated, to restrict myself to schedule 2&mdash;the sale of mining rights.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is something of a history to this provision. It is worth, I think, drawing it to the attention of the House. What we are dealing with here is the extent to which the sale of a mining right or an explorer's right is taxable income. Historically, whilst there have been some variations it has been the case for many years that the income derived from the sale of a miner's right or that of an individual explorer or a prospector has been tax exempt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The historical rationale of that has been to provide some incentive to prospectors, some incentive to explorers&mdash;to put it crassly but in vivid terms; this is what occurs in the industry&mdash;to be kicking over rocks, seeking gold and other minerals by way of exploration so 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that up the scale larger sized companies will be in a position to develop those leases which have been successfully explored.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislative history of this particular provision started on budget night, 20 August 1996, when the Treasurer (Mr Costello) announced that, effective from budget night, the income derived from the sale of miners' rights would be taxable in the hands of the prospector. That was the subject of consternation by the industry, particularly with the relevant associations, such as the Amalgamated Prospectors and Leaseholders Association and the Association of Mining and Exploration Companies, AMEC, from Western Australian.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to note that that is where the consternation came because the Amalgamated Prospectors and Leaseholders Association and AMEC reflect, to a very large extent, the lower end of the gold mining and exploring and minerals mining and exploring sector in Western Australia and generally. The consternation expressed by both of those associations was that this was, in effect, a retrospective measure. Whilst the disposal of a miner's right after 20 August 1996 might be a prospective act, the nature of the industry and the effort that went into the exploration, and the view that prospectors and leaseholders had in respect of working their lots and knowing or expecting at the end of the day that the income from the sale of their miner's right would be tax free, had an adverse effect, was unfair and was retrospective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Treasurer made a very slight amendment to that provision in October 1996 when he announced that the provision would have effect but there would essentially be a transitional arrangement so that the disposal of a miner's right between 20 August 1996 and the end of December 1996 would effectively remain tax free. The 1996 version of this bill, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1996, went to the Senate and was referred to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee. The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1996, just as this year's bill does, dealt with a range of things. In the Economics Legislation Committee of the Senate paragraph 23(pa) was the subject of a majority report by 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5277"> government senators, a minority report by  Senator Cook and Senator Sherry from the opposition and a separate minority report from Senator Murray from Western Australia on behalf of the Australian Democrats.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following that Senate committee report the matter was dealt with in the Senate and a five&hyphen;year grandfathering clause, subject to a range of conditions, was adopted by the Senate. That five&hyphen;year grandfathering provision, subject to a range of conditions being satisfied, was not technically competent and we see the government bringing back this measure to the House courtesy of Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have circulated some amendments to schedule 2 which reflect the opposition's position. The government has circulated some amendments of its own. I am proposing in the course of this contribution to outline to the House the opposition's amendment and the view that the opposition takes. I will leave comment on the circulated government amendments to the consideration in detail stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The model that was effectively agreed in the Senate between the Democrats and the government in debate on the 1996 No. 3 bill was to institute a five&hyphen;year grandfathering provision subject to conditions. Those conditions were that, if you were a bona fide prospector who had a right to mine on or before budget night on 20 August 1996, if you derived income from that before 20 August 2001 and provided that on or before 20 August 1996 and at the time you derived the income you were a bona fide prospector, then you were entitled to tax exemption from the sale of that miner's right to the value of the miner's right as at 20 August 1996. That was the regime which was attempted to be effected in the Senate between the government and the Democrats. That was technically deficient. The attempt is now to resuscitate or rescue that in a technically effective way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments that I have circulated are in a sense in the alternative. In the first instance, the opposition repeats the view which it articulated in the Senate so far as this issue was concerned when it was dealt with in the 1996 bill&mdash;namely, to go down this 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> road is all well and good, but if you propose to go down this road then you cannot do it in any retrospective way and the cleanest way, the fairest way, of effecting that is to grandfather the provision so that, if you are in possession of a miner's right on or before 20 August 1996, budget night, and you subsequently dispose of that miner's right, then the income derived from that is tax exempt. The corollary to that is that, if you acquire a miner's right after budget night on 20 August 1996 and subsequently derive income from it, you pay tax on that income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first amendment which I have circulated is what I describe as the comprehensive grandfathering provision. In the alternative, if that is defeated, the second amendment is to effect a five-year grandfathering provision. In other words, if you were the owner of a miner's right on budget night 1996 and you subsequently dispose of that within a five-year period&mdash;namely, in the period to 20 August 2001&mdash;then the income which is derived from that is tax free, provided you were a bona fide prospector on or before budget night 1996. That five-year grandfathering provision does not contain any of the conditions which we find in the model proposed by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third amendment that I propose on behalf of the opposition, if my first two amendments are unsuccessful, is to remove the requirement that we find in the government's model that you are required to be a bona fide prospector both on or before budget night 1996 and at the time you derive the income. I might go in reverse order as listed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I regard the model that the government is proposing as being both retrospective and unfair, to a very large extent because of the valuation requirements that are imposed upon the prospector. But perhaps the harshest and most pernicious of the requirements is the requirement that the person who disposes of the miner's right&mdash;the bona fide prospector&mdash;has to be a bona fide prospector both on budget night 1996 and when the income is derived.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The harshest example I can imagine is that you were a bona fide prospector on 20 August 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5278"> 1996. The next day, the day after the budget,  you are out in the Yilgarn kicking over rocks, as is the case with the Yilgarn around the Southern Cross&hyphen;Three Boy Hill area where I grew up. There is the odd small open cut and the odd mine shaft. You fall down that while exploring your leasehold, and you go from being a bona fide prospector to an invalid pensioner overnight. On the government's regime, as a consequence of that, you would not get the exemption which the government proposes in the course of its regime. That is the harshest and most pernicious of the effects, in my view, outlined by the government's model.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you go from that provision to the valuation provisions, what the government is proposing by way of this amendment is that a bona fide prospector will only be exempt for the income derived from the value of the mining lease as determined as at budget night 1996. To try to determine now or any time between 20 August 2001 what the value of a particular exploration or mining lease might be is a highly speculative and highly contentious matter. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the government is seeking to do by this measure is to effectively retrospectively tax people, to do that unfairly. Government members have just come from a discussion on taxation. One of the key principles that they ought to be concerned with is not to allow taxation to occur retrospectively. That is what the government is proposing to do to individual prospectors and individual exploration leaseholders in Western Australia and other states by the proposal which they are effecting to section 23(pa) through this Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) of 1997. This has been the subject of consideration by the Senate legislation committee. The weight of that report is that the government ought not to do anything which is retrospective and unfair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With my agreement and connivance, the Chief Opposition Whip called a quorum. Before that I was drawing the attention of the House to the fact that the model which the government has chosen by requiring a market valuation of the value of the miner's lease as at 20 August 1996 is highly impracticable, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> unfair and highly speculative. This has been the thrust of the various submissions that were made by the relevant associations in the course of the Senate hearing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very hard to place a speculative value on things but it is notoriously difficult to place a value on a miner's right to explore. The effect of the government amendment is to try and place an arbitrary value on that as at 20 August 1996. When you go through some of the taxation rulings of Commissioner of Taxation where valuations fall for consideration, he makes it quite clear that in this area he is not bound by any valuation which an individual taxpayer might go out and get and is appropriately able to go behind that valuation at any point in the cycle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the regime that the government proposes to put in place? It is a regime which will, in the first instance, force individual prospectors, small explorers, if they are operating mining rights at this point in time, to go back and seek a valuation as at 20 August 1996, knowing that the nature of exploration and the nature of the industry is such that, even if you get a valuation as at 20 August 1996, that may well not be worth the paper it is written on even though it will cost you a not insignificant sum to achieve it from an independent valuer. The regime that the government has picked here is, in my view, a retrospective and an unfair regime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments that I have circulated, as I have said, are a complete grandfathering and, in the alternative, a five&hyphen;year grandfathering provision, which is picked up from the minority report presented by Senator Murray in the Senate. At page 63 of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee report he recommends:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> in respect of prospectors and schemes in train and eligible prior to 20 August 1996, we propose extending the applicability of 23(pa) until 20 August 2001.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I have not quite yet discerned how, between that minority recommendation and the passage of the 1996 bill through the Senate, the various provisions we have seen imposed on the five-year grandfathering which I have outlined came to light.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5279">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite clear in my mind that the model which the government has struck upon is in  fact retrospective. It is effectively unworkable. Its effect is to be unfair. Its effect will be to discourage exploration at the lower end of the scale at precisely one of the points in the economic cycle where incentives to exploration would actually be a happy and a useful thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth noting in conclusion that 23(pa) was the subject of recommendation by Mr Gutman in his report, which recommended the changed arrangements to 23(o) which saw the taxing of income from gold mining production being changed by this parliament. Section 23(pa) was left in place by the then government's response to that report. If it is now to be changed, it ought not to be changed unfairly or retrospectively. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is becoming commonplace to see a multitude of complex and often unrelated taxation amendments included for debate in the one bill. As I indicated last year, this is far from satisfactory. In this instance the government has incorporated 15 schedules in this legislation. Out of necessity, having regard to limits on speaking times, I will be restricted to focusing on those measures which seek to make changes to the application of the capital gains tax, the CGT, and the two amendments relating to superannuation. Time permitting, I will briefly comment on schedule 11, which proposes further amendments to research and development.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first schedule outlined in this legislation relates to the capital gains tax exemption on assets from the sale of small businesses when the eligible assets are used for retirement income. On the face of it, this amendment appears to be one of the few meaningful concessions the coalition has made to the small business sector since its election to the government benches. But I suspect that small business proprietors will be equally disappointed as independent analysts have been once they appreciate the limited nature of this provision.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once enacted, its effect will be to extend the capital gains tax exemption on the sale of small businesses for retirement subject to a lifetime limit of $500,000. Most tax experts agree that the $500,000 capital gain limit is insubstantial given the stated intent of the exemption. This provision is supposedly designed to reward individuals who provide for their own retirement through their business. But, as the Taxation Institute of Australia, the TIA, makes clear, the $500,000 limit is both arbitrary and would provide only a modest retirement income stream to a retiree. In addition, the proposed legislation makes no allowance for indexing and will therefore decrease in real value over time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The TIA suggests that the capital gain limit should instead be brought into line with the goodwill capital gains tax exemption amount of $2 million. It noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no reason why business is characterised as small business for CGT purposes if it is below $2 million but $0.5 million for the schedule 1 relief.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Taxation Institute of Australia is also critical of the government's decision to force the receipt of all the proceeds from the sale of an enterprise within a three&hyphen;year period. Small business owners will have to take possession of all proceeds within 12 months before the sale of a business and up to two years after disposal. The restriction will not encourage small business owners to provide for their own retirement. The TIA rightly points out that there is no logic behind the decision to restrict instalment sales. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would seem that the incentive to provide for self-superannuation by means of small business would dictate that taxpayers be given all commercial options for the sale of their business to attract the highest possible amount upon which to retire.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It has also suggested that the three&hyphen;year maximum should be removed entirely. At the very least, it should be extended. If the government is really serious about encouraging self&hyphen;funded retirement amongst proprietors in the small business sector, it must review this provision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Association of Taxation and Management Accountants, the ATMA, has branded this exemption as a Clayton's exemption 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5280"> because of its limited application. Mr Nick Petroulias, a director of ATMA, has outlined how the only business structures to benefit from this exemption are sole traders or a couple working in partnership to the exclusion  of other family members. Both the ATMA and the Taxation Institute of Australia suggest that these structures are rare in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This proposal clearly discriminates against those small businesses which operate outside of normal trading hours. For example, many small businesses in the hospitality industry are owned and operated by a partnership of more than one couple in order to meet demanding trading hours. Not one of these partnerships will qualify for the exemption. Similarly, those family businesses which see more than one generation share in 50 per cent of the legal and equitable interest will gain no benefit from this exemption whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The TIA has recommended that the government forsake the dual controlling individual test and replace it with what they call a substantial controller test. This test is obviously more inclusive and would still ensure that the only persons to benefit from the exemption are those who are integral to the day-to-day running of affected small businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has talked endlessly about its commitment to small business over the last 12 months. Now is the time for it to practice what it has been preaching and rethink these ridiculously restrictive terms. This exemption is a once only concession. It relates only to assets used in the business and the legislation specifies that the net value of these assets cannot exceed $5 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem with this is one of symmetry. Although passive assets such as rental investments are not covered by the capital gains tax exemption, they must be applied against the exemption amount if they give rise to capital losses. There is no balance between those assets that do qualify for the exemption and those which can reduce the exemption. The TIA has suggested that this can be overcome by stipulating that `the capital losses that can reduce the CGT exempt amount be only those assets for which the CGT exemption can be claimed'. That would be far more equitable 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and makes terribly good sense. This schedule has sensibly been referred to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation because of equity concerns with the proposed amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the problems with this amendment are not restricted to the issue of fairness. In the same way that the government's superannuation surcharge legislation was poorly thought out and shabbily drafted, there are fundamental errors in this bill. One example of the ragged drafting of this legislation is to be found in sections 160 ZZPZE and 160 ZZPZH. The TIA has demonstrated that the final eligible termination payment, the ETP, figures used in calculations in the bill are incorrect. The example given in the bill is incorrect. In each instance, the final ETP amount is calculated at $100 when in fact it should read $1,000. That is a pretty fundamental error.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These figures are both confusing and misleading to any small business proprietor who might attempt to make head or tail of this legislation. As if the small business community does not have enough to worry about in the running of their enterprises, they now, again, have to contend with legislation that has been drafted by bureaucrats who are unconcerned with, or unequipped to cope with the checking of, the accuracy of the information with which they are, or should be, provided. It is simply not good enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other concern I harbour about schedule 1 goes to the application of the 15 per cent contributions tax when a business is sold to fund an individual's retirement. During the debate on the Superannuation Contributions Surcharge Bill 1997, I pressed the government for information on whether it intended to apply the new surcharge to the proceeds from the sale of a small business. In his response on 24 March 1997, the member for Braddon (Mr Miles), speaking on behalf of the government, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the member for Curtin . . . asked whether the proposed legislation suggests that the superannuation tax will be applied to the proceeds of the sale of a small business if it exceeds the [$70,000] threshold amount. The answer to that is no. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5281"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It was reassuring to hear the parliamentary secretary give such an unambiguous answer to my question. I wonder whether he would care to give a similarly decisive reply to this question: does the government intend for the proceeds of the sale of a small business that is to be used for retirement income to be  subject to the current 15 per cent contributions tax? There is no mention of this in the government's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">More time for business</EMPHASIS>  package, and I cannot recall anyone pressing either the Treasurer (Mr Costello) or the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser) on this matter. While I am certain that every small business operator in this country is breathing a sigh of relief to know that they will not be hit by the double whammy&mdash;that is, a combined 30 per cent tax rate&mdash;the government needs to be specific about the application of the existing 15 per cent contributions tax in this instance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is right to require individuals who are under age 55 at the time of disposal of the assets to roll over the proceeds of the sale into a recognised superannuation fund or retirement savings account. An individual can opt not to comply with this requirement&mdash;but at the expense of not qualifying for the exemption. This provision will ensure that these funds are preserved for retirement income, and it should be supported by all in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In contrast to the multitude of shortcomings that need to be addressed in schedule 1, schedule 5&mdash;another capital gains tax measure&mdash;is fairly straightforward and is a welcome amendment. Once enacted, it will double the capital gains tax exemption period for inherited dwellings from one to two years and will provide a limited CGT exemption to the beneficiary of a deceased estate, where the beneficiary uses the estate as a principal place of residence. This is good policy and it has been embraced by the accounting fraternity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment will also mean that anyone who inherits a dwelling as a result of debt will acquire the dwelling at its market value when it is used for income producing purposes. That is a worthwhile reform and is intended to reduce the compliance burden on taxpayers. However, the TIA has argued that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the operation of market value rules should not apply automatically and that taxpayers should have the option of using market value or actual cost where appropriate records of actual cost are maintained. It suggests that there may be cases where individuals are disadvantaged by this amendment in its present form. Therefore, the TIA has suggested that, where adequate records are available to them, taxpayers be given the choice of using the actual cost of the property as the cost base.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other schedule that deals with capital gains tax in this bill is schedule 13. It seeks to amend rules applying to subsidiary company liquidations. As in the case of schedule 5, most tax experts have welcomed this initiative but have outlined two restrictions in the amendment. The first relates to the timing of the amendment. The explanatory memorandum accompanying this bill states that the amendment will apply to share cancellations occurring after 20 August 1996; that is, the date of the 1996-97 budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the Taxation Institute of Australia asserts that it should have a retrospective application to the date when section 160ZZO, which deals with corporate reconstructions, was enacted. The TIA has said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If this is a genuine effort to overcome unintended consequences of rollovers to subsidiaries, then the amendment should be retrospective to June 1986 . . . and permit holding companies that have borne unnecessary CGT liabilities over the last 10 years to amend their returns for the relevant years.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The TIA's call for the retrospective application of schedule 13 is entirely supportable and should be reviewed by the coalition because it will confer a real benefit to individual taxpayers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some tax experts have also argued that the relief from CGTs should be extended to include the interim distribution of assets by the liquidator. As it stands, the proposal will limit the CGT relief to a liquidator's final distributions. It is apparent that this amendment is only applicable to final distributions because of Treasury fears of a loss to revenue through tax avoidance or tax minimisation. However, the Taxation Institute of Australia rightly points out that the government can prevent this abuse by including an anti- 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5282">avoidance mechanism that guarantees the final dissolution of the subsidiary within a reasonable time frame while allowing a more immediate access to the assets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why should companies wanting to legitimately utilise this exemption be restricted from accessing the assets of their subsidiaries  because of the liquidator's timetable? These businesses may be prevented from taking advantage of investment opportunities in the immediate term simply because they are waiting on the final distribution of assets. This is plainly unreasonable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment, though, is a good one in its general intent. But if Australian businesses are to remain competitive in the global marketplace, then the government must extend the exemption to include interim distribution of shares.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Schedule 9 in the bill, which seeks to increase the age threshold for superannuation contributions, is a reasonable one. It lessens yet another discriminative hurdle for those trying to provide for their own retirement. However, if the government were truly serious about reversing the downward spiral in national savings, it would have removed the age limit entirely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is apparent to anyone who cares to investigate that the former government's policy has failed to generate adequate levels of superannuation funds and savings. This amendment would see employers bound to continue making superannuation contributions on behalf of their employee if a bona fide link with the paid work force is maintained by that individual until age 70. A worker must be gainfully employed for a minimum of 10 hours per week over the year if he or she is to continue with their superannuation contributions. It is a fair provision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation provides some incentive for individuals who postpone their retirement. It gives Australians who want to remain productive in the paid work force for longer the opportunity to save for their own retirement. But the effect of this legislation might be undermined by the fact that many Australians can draw on their superannuation funds at age 55. Obviously, the decline which we see was 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> under way long before the former government announced its campaign to lift national savings through superannuation. However, the trend will continue if the current government fails to act and stop people from accessing their superannuation funds as early as age 55.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The impact of raising the age threshold on superannuation contributions on the federal government's unfunded liability should not be underestimated. As at March 1996 the public sector held between $80 billion to $100 billion in unfunded liabilities, plus contingent liabilities on privatised former government trading enterprises, most of which is a liability to this federal government. By increasing the age threshold on compulsory employer superannuation contributions, the government will have to fund an even greater debt in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The financial impact statement accompanying the bill estimates that the cost to revenue of these measures will amount to around $16 million for the years 1998 to 2000. This is a substantial cost to revenue, but it is a cost worth bearing if it is offset by a greater increase in superannuation contributions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other amendment relating to superannuation in this bill will allow for a rebate of up to $540 per annum to be paid to any person who contributes to superannuation on behalf of a non-working or low income earning spouse. I am going to run out of time, and that is one of my objections to these omnibus bills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In introducing this amendment, the government is meeting another of its 1996-97 budget promises. Under the current superannuation laws, a fund cannot accept contributions from non-working individuals and favours full-time and part-time employees. This amendment should therefore be of particular benefit to the many women and casually employed Australians who cannot take full advantage of current superannuation arrangements. The rebate maximum of $540 per annum is quite generous. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to talk about 23(pa) and the retrospective nature of it. It is not surprising that it is retrospective, and quite clearly it is. After all, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) was one of the great architects of retrospective taxation legislation with all its injustices.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CF4">Mr CAMPBELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is why you are better off out of them. The point I want to make about 23(pa) is that it is not understood clearly by the government. The reason is that it is not city based; it is a country initiative which adds and creates real wealth in the community and the taxation measures they are going to take are going to stifle it. For the big prospector, it is no great problem. He will simply move into forming companies and get around it that way. The very small prospector will now go underground and sell his stuff on the black market. For the genuine middle of the range prospector, it offers real problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I support the amendment put forward by the Labor Party, I think they ought to consider amending their amendment to substitute mining rights for prospecting licences or any other form of licence granted by states or territories. A lot of these leases are sold at the (pa) stage: a prospector finds a good prospect, does not have the money to develop it further and sells it. I think the Labor Party would be well advised to consider amending their amendment to read along those lines. I am sure a lot of small prospectors would be very grateful, even though it is going to fail in this House because the Liberal Party has no real regard for the contribution made by small prospectors to the mining industry. It is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> interesting to note, with the enormous levels of technology now, just how many mines are still found by that small prospector. I guess that is going to go on for a long time because a lot of the complex data is easy to misread or overlook.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to talk about small business because I believe most of the things the government has done in the budget are illusionary. There are some benefits to retiring small business people under some circumstances, but it does not come anywhere near addressing the real problems of small business. If the government were to agree to pay its bills in 30 days, it would be a big benefit to small business. I also make the point that when we talk about small business in this House everyone thinks about small business employing just a handful of people. What is also overlooked is medium sized business, which gets continually overlooked, for which nothing much has been done in this budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Something the government can do for medium sized business is to give it consideration in respect to government contracts. After all, in any economy, whether it is Stalin's Russia or Reagan's America, the government is the biggest single customer. A recent example we have had is in defence purchasing where the army has opted for the Swedish inflatable field hospitals when they could have bought Australian. I doubt that a Swedish one is any better. In fact, I am led to believe it is not. I doubt whether it is much cheaper. But, certainly, if all the ramifications of buying Australian were taken into account, they would have bought the Australian product.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite clearly, there are only three rationales that you can think of for why they do not. The first reason is that the army has no genuine commitment to Australian industry and would rather keep itself free to pick from throughout the world. This is a very short-sighted view and not good for the defence of Australia, but without a manufacturing industry there can be no real defence commitment. The second reason is just blind stupidity and the third reason is corruption&mdash;and they are all possibilities.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5284">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know it is not just governments that place a burden on small business. I know of situations today where small businesses are being squeezed by big businesses that have taken up to 90 days to pay their bills&mdash;not because they do not have the money but because they understand it reduces their costs; they use their money for longer. It is certainly a burden on the smaller business. When I was in business I had this experience myself with  Coles who behaved in the most rapacious manner towards small business and often thought to delay paying their bills and demanded quite substantial discounts. I was lucky. I was a small business person in a licensed business and found out that stopping supply was a very good way of getting money from them. But I found that that was the attitude of companies like that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just want to say something about tax. Tax is now a big concern. It is quite clear that the government is gearing itself for a new assault on the goods and services tax. In my view, the goods and services tax is a dangerous tax. Former Senator Walsh was arguably the best Minister for Finance this parliament has ever seen and certainly the man who created the myth of `the world's greatest Treasurer' because Keating's achievements were made on the outlay side, which were all the result of the Minister for Finance. While Keating grudgingly admitted that in caucus on occasions, he never publicly acknowledged the debt owed to former Senator Walsh. It must be remembered that the Labor Party inherited a massive deficit when it came to power. In those days the deficit, great though the one is today, in real terms, was greater. But the work done by former Senator Walsh has not been well enough recognised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Former Senator Walsh had one very good dictum: governments will always spend all the money but mostly they will waste it. I think he is right. What will happen with the GST is that the total tax take will rise incrementally. It is just too easy for government to say, `We have just increased the GST by 0.347 per cent; hardly worth worrying about.'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But, as the member for Curtin says, on top of bracket creep, it will 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> become a substantial tax and the total tax take from government will inevitably rise. How do I know this? Because it has happened everywhere else in the world where this has been applied, and this country will be no different.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe the government should consider other options. I think the debit tax has some superficial attractions. It is a very easy tax to collect. In fact, you make the banks responsible, not small business. The cost of collecting the GST will impact disproportionately on small business. Big business likes it&mdash;they just alter the software&mdash;but small business will incur a very high impost cost. The government's talking about reducing the paperwork burden on small business is an absolute joke.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have seen figures that suggest that if you tax all bank withdrawals at 0.34c in the dollar you raise enough money to replace entirely income tax. I suspect those figures are based on the existence of foreign exchange transactions. If they are, the figures will not hold up because it will simply stop those foreign exchange transactions. Not that that would concern me. I do not think they do Australia one iota of good, but the money would simply not be there to be taxed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it would be nice to know. I think the government has an obligation to examine the debit tax, the Labor figures before the House, so we can be informed. The government, of course, is the only one that really has the capacity to do this. With the almost infinite resources of Treasury, it could do it very quickly. For people in positions like me, it is nigh on impossible to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A tax such as this could really revolutionise the way we operate in this country and could give a real benefit to small business and to the entire economy. Workers in my electorate would be very grateful if they could do away entirely with pay&hyphen;as&hyphen;you&hyphen;earn income tax because, while a lot of them are earning very high incomes, they are also living in areas of very high cost&mdash;a factor which seems to be ignored by all governments. So I implore the government to give us some figures on the debit tax. Let us examine and argue the case for it because it may in fact be a much better tax than the GST.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5285">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I suspect the government does not care. The government is going down the road of the GST because it is a tax that big business wants, not a tax that small business wants. It will inevitably give the customer what it wants. The facts are, of course, that big business is the biggest contributor to the funds of the Liberal Party, as it is today to the funds of the Labor Party. Gone are the days when the Labor Party could rely on trade  union money. So I do implore the Treasurer (Mr Costello) to give us some facts on the debit tax and let us make up our own minds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a point that I missed on 23(pa). When Paul Keating engaged Mr Gutman to do a study on the taxation of gold, he employed Mr Gutman because he knew what he was going to get. He knew Mr Gutman's record and knew that he would recommend a tax on gold. I think Mr Gutman was a man of integrity, quite frankly, but his view was one with which I did not concur. He did, however, have the sense to realise that 23(pa) was the very foundation of exploration, and he specifically recommended that that not be taxed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nothing at all has changed since that time. It is still the foundation of exploration, it is still the foundation of the enormous wealth the mining industry contributes to Australia, but this city based government, the Howard urban centralist government, does not give a damn about those factors. It will be quite prepared to kill the golden goose, just as the state government in Western Australia is introducing in that state a royalty at $11 dollars an ounce on gold production. If the price of gold fell by $11 dollars an ounce tomorrow, every financial journalist would be talking about it. But a government can put an impost like that on it and follow it in the next year with another $11.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a significant blow to the industry. It will put many mines below the cost of production. Many mines are presently working below the cost of production and existing entirely on forward sales. So you will see this whammy in the mining industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Couple this with native title&mdash;which is compounded in the goldfields with more overlapping titles than anywhere else in Australia&mdash;and you have this nonsense from 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the opposition and from the government saying that it has not affected gold production. It has not so far, because gold production has all come from brownfield sites, but mines are now moving into greenfield sites, and every greenfield site is subject to a native title claim. It is undoubtedly going to have an effect on production.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I really came into the House tonight to talk just about 23(pa). I certainly hope the Labor Party gives some consideration to amending their amendment along the lines I foreshadowed. It is unlikely to pass the Senate, but I think it is beholden on the Labor Party&mdash;in fact, all people of commonsense&mdash;to try their very best to get this obnoxious retrospective piece of tax legislation thrown out.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this debate on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) and the Income Tax Rates Amendment Bill (No. 1) because I want to go to the issue of what the government has done to research and development in this country as a consequence of last year's budget&mdash;its attempts to correct it but essentially with disastrous consequences. I think that the research and development element of this legislation arises from the government's short-sighted and counterproductive attack on industrial research and development both before and as part of the 1996-97 budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year Labor opposed the main elements of this attack: the reduction of the research and development tax concession from 150 per cent to 125 per cent and the cessation of research and development syndication. Although on the last occasion we were able to win some concessions on retrospective aspects of the measures, Labor was not successful in defeating these anti-innovation, anti-growth and anti-job decisions, but Australia is already seeing the tragic impact of these decisions on the national IR&amp;D effort.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to the government's own science and technology budget statement for 1997-98, government support for industrial research and development will fall to $487 million in 1997-98&mdash;half the level that it reached in 1995-96. Of particular concern is the emerging evidence of a collapse in the amount of research and development being carried out 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5286"> by industry. Labor warned last year that axing the research and development concessions would mean that business would walk away from research and development in Australia, particularly as some countries offer up to 200 per cent to encourage research and development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor's warning is already being shown as very accurate indeed. For example, the innovative Cochlear company has said it will lose  $1 million a year from the government's decision. According to Jim Fox of Vision Systems Ltd, the cuts have led to a 15 per cent reduction in their research and development spending. To quote his words, `We have gone backwards. What the last budget did was awesome in terms of its negative impact on our science and technology. It has drilled us right back to the 1960s in some ways.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To give some indication of the magnitude of this cut, I turn to the science and technology budget statement, in particular to the summary notes at the beginning, because this tries to paint a much more rosy picture of this government's massive cuts into research and development. Under the line `Industry research and development incentives', we can see in that statement what is alleged to be a mere four per cent reduction in the amount of expenditure on major programs for science and innovation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, of course, this is a dishonest presentation of what has happened because, if we go to the report of the year before, we can see that under that same line what was spent in 1995-96, the last year of Labor, was $935 million with the then government's forward estimate being $700 million&mdash;that is, Labor spent $935 million and the new government coming into office said it was going to reduce that figure to $700 million. But what has been the fact? The $700 million became $492 million actual and it is falling from that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have got is a huge cut in the amount of money being spent on research and development in this country. If there is any doubt of that, I refer those members who are interested to table 6 on page 318 of the document, which talks about the estimated costs of programs and incentives providing 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> support for research and innovation outside the budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under `Industry, science and tourism', the tax concession for industrial research and development goes from $820 million&mdash;and this is the effective government actions in the wider community&mdash;in Labor's last year of office to $348 million estimated in 1996-97, the first year of the coalition government. This is a two-thirds hacking into the industrial research and development budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me remind the House of what the coalition had to say going into the election, because it is pretty revealing in terms of the dishonesty with which they went to the election and the actuality when they arrived. This is what they said in terms of industrial research and innovation in their own policy statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Industry expenditure on research and development in Australia remains among the lowest in the OECD area. Furthermore, the rate of growth of non-government research and development in Australia has been surpassed by the dynamic, emerging, Asian economies of South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition believes that increasing industrial research and development and the commercialisation of research and development is a critical component in economic growth, higher standards of living and the creation of new, sustainable jobs.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They go on to talk about changes to the syndicated research and development tax concession schemes&mdash;these were the ones that Labor was proposing to tighten up&mdash;and say that they `may well result in the drying up of one of the few effective forms of venture capital available in Australia to fund research and development.' Then they wipe the whole scheme all together. Having criticised Labor's attempts to tighten in the belief that this would dry up funding, they then abolished the scheme altogether. It then goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the Coalition is not planning specific changes to existing programs of industry support for research and development, and has just accepted the extension of the computer bounty . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Let us just understand how dishonest they were. They cut the 150 per cent research and development tax concessions to 125 per cent, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5287"> they abolished syndication and, to wrap it all up, they also abolished the computer bounty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a government that does crumble under pressure. We saw it on the car tariff issue recently. Maybe we will see it over the next few days on the sugar tariff issue as well. I will be interested to see where the National Party sits in terms of this, in terms of being mugged and dudded by their senior partners in government. Having said, `We are a government to reduce tariffs and we will do it to the car industry so trust us, therefore, we  are doing it first to you,' they then backflipped in terms of the car tariff issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister was mincing into the parliament at 3 o'clock in the afternoon on Thursday telling this parliament the last thing they would be doing is adopting Labor's plan for the car tariff industry because that was cheapjack populism. Within three hours they had embraced it&mdash;Cheapjack Prime Minister joining Black Jack minister for industry John Moore. What a dreadful double. But the fact is that it is a government that crumbles under pressure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the budget before last, they abolished four bounties. The computer bounty was only one of them; the others were the shipbuilding bounty, the machine tools and robotics bounty and the books bounty. Labor's campaign has seen restored three of those four. Books are back. Shipbuilding is back. The Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles), who is at the table, did not lift a finger to help the shipbuilding industry in his state. It was Labor that had to run that campaign. Now, a week ago, the machine tools and robotics bounty is back. Three down, one to go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a government that crumbles under pressure. This is a government whose own backbench is revolting because it does not understand and cannot defend the inconsistency of its decisions. Little wonder! They have a party that went to the election promising one thing and then completely turned on those who elected them and voted those propositions out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are really seeing a huge impact on the way in which research and development will 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> be undertaken in this country. Significant as the cut was&mdash;this is the cut from the $810 million I talked of before which at the time they told us they were only taking from $810 million down to $547 million (and you would have thought that was bad enough)&mdash;the actuality is that there is a further $200 million off it because what this budget statement shows, and what we are debating today, is that $348 million will be the final figure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said before, that is a cut to research and development from $810 million to, if you like, $286 million in just two years. That is a massive cut of two&hyphen;thirds. This is a government that wants to pretend it still wants to nurture the clever country. This is a government that talks about the need to develop clever industries, new industries, technologically driven industries, but will not lift a finger of support. Clearly, the downward revision in this year's budget statement shows industry has significantly wound back its R&amp;D effort to a greater extent than was projected in the 1996&hyphen;97 budget. The fact of the matter is that industry is simply walking away from investing in research and development in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bad as the cuts here are, what are other countries doing? They are going the other way. Japan has passed a law, for example, requiring government expenditure on R&amp;D to double by 2000. Research and development expenditure will increase by 12&half; per cent to $50 billion a year. Japan's is a government that understands the importance of encouraging research and development, but not our short&hyphen;sighted, visionless government. We have also got China trebling its science budget from 0.5 per cent of GDP to 1.5 per cent of GDP and Singapore&mdash;these are countries that we are told we should compare ourselves with&mdash;offering a 200 per cent research and development concession. I do not know how many times we have to demonstrate to this government that the sorts of directions it is heading us in are completely opposite to those of our trading partners and competitors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that research and development is fundamental to industry development in this country. Labor had a suit of measures. It was 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5288"> not just the 150 per cent tax concession; it was syndication, it was grants and it was the cooperative research centre programs. What the budget of last year, which we are still debating in this place, effectively did was cut $2.2 billion out of research and development&mdash;$1.3 billion of that resulted from the cut from 150 per cent to 125 per cent and the end of syndication took out $900 million. So $2.2 billion was replaced with a scheme called START, another bells and whistles approach by this government&mdash;$340 million. What a terrific contribution! I mean, $2.2 billion out and $340 million in&mdash;that's a big gap, a massive gap. But this is the government's view about how you encourage research and development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact of the matter is that that research and development will go to countries that want it and actually encourage it. Industry is voting with its feet. It is walking away from this country because it knows it has got a government that does not encourage industry, does not want to recognise the huge contribution that it has made and does not want to be in there supporting it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The abolition of syndicated research and development was supposed to be justified on the basis that the system was rorted. Labor, of course, said it was prepared to support measures to ensure that the tax concessions were used for the purposes for which they were intended. Indeed, in the course of the debate last year, we moved amendments to tighten up the syndicated arrangements and to stop the potential for rorting. It is a matter of record now that the government actually voted against those amendments. Despite the government's claims about rorting, it has not come up with one genuine example of where the rorts have occurred. The best it could do was to produce four `actual case examples' that officials later admitted were fabricated.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I will make quite a number of comments in reply to some of the comments which have already been made by speakers in this debate on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3). Can I just go back to the beginning to make sure that it is very clear in this House what the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) is really about. It implements several of the government's election commitments to small business, farmers, beneficiaries of deceased estates and people with superannuation. So there are some tremendous benefits right across the board for many Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The measure regarding exemption from tax on capital gains made on disposal of some or all of the active business assets if the proceeds are used for retirement will benefit thousands of small business operators and is made to expand the choice of superannuation arrangements available to small business people approaching retirement. The government has once again delivered more than its election commitment. The bill contains the extensions to the measure announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in March to people who operate their small business through a private company or trust structure. It is easy in these debates to lose sight of the main 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> themes which are involved in these taxation laws amendments. There are tremendous benefits for a whole range of people in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Turning to some comments made by different speakers, the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), while supporting the CGT exemption measure, referred to an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 13 May 1997 which made a number of allegations about the operation of the measure. It alleged that if a business is sold for a capital gain greater than $500,000 the taxpayer misses out on the exemption. This is plainly wrong. Taxpayers are eligible for the capital gains tax exemption up to a maximum of $500,000 of the capital gain. The capital gain in excess of the capital gains tax exempt amount remains subject to capital gains tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, it also alleged that a family company who gives shares to employees as part of a staff incentive scheme will not benefit from the capital gains exemption. This is incorrect. If the taxpayer who owns the family business has at least a 50 per cent legal and equitable interest in the company, the taxpayer can benefit from the capital gains taxation retirement exemption. I am advised that it would be usual for the taxpayer who owns the business to retain control of the company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) raised concerns about the operation of the capital gains tax measure. I can assure the member for Curtin that, contrary to statements that have been made by certain accountants, taxpayers who can benefit from the capital gains tax retirement exemption are not limited to sole traders and partnerships. Taxpayers who can benefit include all taxpayers operating a small business as a sole trader, all partners in a partnership and any taxpayer who operates a small business through a private company or a trust where the taxpayer is a controlling individual, that is, they have a 50 per cent or greater legal and equitable interest in the business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Curtin also made a few other comments about the capital gains tax exemption measure. Are the examples in the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5290"> capital gains tax requirement exemption provisions wrong? No. The examples in sections 160ZZPZE and 160ZZPZH are correct. The examples in these two provisions demonstrate how much of an amount received as consideration in relation to the disposal of an asset is to be treated as an eligible termination payment where the total amount the taxpayer has received in relation to the asset exceeds the asset's capital gains tax exempt amount.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the example, the taxpayer receives $300 in relation to the disposal of an asset. Initially, the full amount of this payment&mdash;that is, the $300&mdash;is treated as ETP. However, the taxpayer has previously received $900 in relation to the asset and the asset's capital gains tax exempt amount is only $1,000. Therefore, the total consideration received, including the current payment, exceeds the asset's capital gains tax exempt amount by $200. As a consequence, the amount of the current payment to be treated as an eligible termination payment is reduced by the amount of the excess&mdash;that is, from $300 to $100. Each amount of consideration received must be paid as an ETP to the controlling individual until the total CGT exempt amount has been paid as an eligible termination payment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, in regard to this area: has the government given sufficient time for the taxpayer to receive consideration upon the disposal of a small business? The legislation implementing the capital gains tax retirement exemption for small business provides more generous relief than was announced before the election or in the 1996&hyphen;97 budget. The capital gains tax retirement exemption will now be available on consideration received up to 12 months before and 24 months after the sale of the assets of a small business. The consultative group involved in the consultation on the capital gains tax retirement measure in March this year viewed this time limit as quite reasonable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lastly, in regard to this area for the member for Curtin: should the limits for the capital gains tax retirement exemption be the same as the limits for the capital gains tax goodwill exemption? We do not believe so. The answer is no. More small business tax 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> payers can access the capital gains tax retirement exemption than the goodwill exemption. A taxpayer can qualify for the capital gains tax retirement exemption if assets do not exceed $5 million. I think that is a pretty considerable amount of money in this area. However, to qualify for the goodwill exemption the taxpayer's net value must not exceed $2 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Continuing with other general comments, there are other election commitments which are being implemented in this legislation apart from the ones which I referred to earlier. I would like to reiterate some of those: firstly, extension of the principal residence exemption to extend the qualifying period for the capital gains tax from 12 months to two years to assist beneficiaries by giving them more time to dispose of the deceased's principal residence. Many people find that reasonable because it does take time to sort out the affairs of deceased estates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, we will be exempting from the fringe benefits tax remote area housing benefits in the primary production sector. This is, again, a much needed benefit in rural Australia for battling families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, we are providing a rebate for superannuation contributions made on behalf of low income or non&hyphen;working spouses. Again, this is encouragement to provide for the future in regard to superannuation for people who are on low incomes or who are non&hyphen;working. I think both sides of the House would applaud this particular measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fourthly, there is an increase in the age limit for superannuation contributions. The member for Cunningham also indicated that the opposition will be passing the superannuation measures, but will ask the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation to look closely at the other measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has also taken the opportunity to make some technical amendments in this legislation in a number of areas. They include such areas as research and development of mining rights. I want to make some brief comments on research and development. Quite contrary to the member for Hotham (Mr Crean), the government is keen to see re 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5291"> search and development continue in this country, but I do have to point out that there were many rorts involved, particularly in the syndication area. I think it behoves anybody who has the reins of government to do something about rorts. For every dollar that the government was hoping for in research, between $1.40 and $2.40 had to be put in for the government. A lot of that money was not going to research; it was going to the financiers and the people who were organising these arrangements. The government did have to act. We believe that the measures which have been brought in are bringing about changes which were needed and which are preventing the extent of that rorting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In regard to Income Tax Rates Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1997, I make the following  comments. Income Tax Rates Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1997 amends the family taxation initiative legislation to ensure that family tax assistance is properly delivered to the people who are intended to benefit from the measures. The government has circulated amendments to this bill in a number of areas which I will deal with in the committee stages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) has also indicated that the opposition will be moving amendments to the mining rights provision. The government, as I have indicated to the member for Perth, will not be supporting any of the three versions put forward by the opposition. This issue was dealt with comprehensively in the Senate in December last year when we proposed a transitional deadline of 31 December 1996. The retrospectivity line was run comprehensively by members of the opposition. We did not accept it then and we do not accept now that that is true. This ploy by the opposition is a waste of the parliament's time and a re&hyphen;run of a political ploy used by the Labor Party to try to buy votes in the Western Australian elections last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The arguments about retrospectivity which the member for Perth based his amendments on were comprehensively responded to in the last round&mdash;pages 28 and 29 of the Senate Economics References Committee report&mdash;and there is nothing further to be added to that. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Maybe I can expedite matters by taking this opportunity at the outset to indicate briefly what the opposition's response to the whole swag of amendments is. I want to conclude by raising some specific matters about amendment Nos 4 and 5 which the parliamentary  secretary might care to respond to. So far as the amendments as a whole are concerned, might I omit a yelp of protest about the fact that this impenetrable 22 pages of prose, which would defeat even the most sophisticated Philadelphia lawyer, arrived on our desks at 12.25 p.m. today. There had been an earlier version of this circulated some days previously, but that seems to have been thrown overboard in favour of this so we are grappling somewhat in the dark. We had some 100 pages of amendments in the parent legislation and now we have another 22 pages of complex amendments to go with it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To the extent that we can make any sense of them at all, let me indicate briefly what our responses are. So far as the gains and losses provisions are concerned, which are dealt with in amendment Nos. 1, 3, 9 to 19 and 21&mdash;there seems to be some oddity in the way in which the enumeration is accomplished&mdash;we supported the stated aims of aligning the amendments in this legislation amending the 1936 act and the corresponding provisions in the 1997 act and the further technical amendments. Unless there is something lurking in the forest which we have not fully appreciated, we will not be making a fuss about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will come to the CGT exemption in the context of amendment Nos 4 and 5 in a moment. As to research and development, it 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> may be that my colleague the shadow minister for industry may wish to speak on these amendments as he did so forcefully in terms of the parent provisions. I think it is another sign of the government's muddle in this respect that these amendments which on the face of them do not seem to raise any new policy issues nonetheless have to be introduced at this late stage of the process. We hope that is the last we will see by way of amendment on this particular issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to the provision on deductions for gifts, the opportunities have been taken in the bill to enact some previously announced tax deductibility status for three charities&mdash;the Australian National Korean War Memorial trust fund, the AAP Mawson's Huts Foundation and the Australian Foundation for Culture and Humanities. We will support this without any fuss because we do understand the benefit of enacting these measures as soon as possible giving certainty to potential donors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to the sale of mining rights and the set of amendments that are involved there, my colleague the shadow minister for resources and energy will certainly have something more to say on them and pursue the opposition's own amendments in that respect. That will occupy a substantial further swag of debate I suspect, certainly not being able to be concluded tonight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final thing that we do have some problem with is the so-called technical amendments&mdash;and that is a pretty bizarre description&mdash;which include an attempt to fix the bungle that was made with the health insurance rebate. My colleague the shadow minister for health will unquestionably have something to say on this matter. Because what we had very briefly was an exercise in which the government sought to lift the threshold at which taxpayers, often families, can access the medical expenses rebate from $1,000 to $1,250&mdash;that is, weakening the existing safety net, costing taxpayers another $250 in unreimbursed health expenses before any tax relief was granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But in amending the law to accomplish this particular enormity, or to endeavour to accomplish it, the government actually forgot to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5293"> specify the legislation which was to be amended, namely, the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, so it has crept sheepishly back into this House with amendment No. 21, I think&mdash;not amendment No. 20 as it says in the explanatory memorandum&mdash;hoping that it would not be noticed, but it has been. You have been sprung. The government has made a terrible idiot of itself in this respect. It has done so moreover with respect to a policy which should never have been implemented in the first place. I imagine under those circumstances that the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) will make doubly sure that this does not pass unnoticed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I now turn to amendment Nos 4 and 5 very briefly. I make the point that these amendments are highly technical and we frankly have not had the full opportunity to absorb their impact in the time available. They will need further consideration by us. In  particular, we have amendment No. 5 dealing with the interaction of this $500,000 retirement exemption proposal, about which I spoke in the second reading debate, together with the notoriously complex and cumbersome 15 per cent superannuation surcharge tax. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> What the amendment appears to be doing is proposing to exempt a recipient of up to $500,000 from the 15 per cent surcharge&mdash;a surcharge which we have heard repeatedly is supposed to apply to high income earners. At first blush, this appears to be directly contrary to the supposed philosophy of the whole surcharge, which is to impose a higher tax burden on high income earners. Surely someone who picks up half a million tax free in a particular year would be a high income earner by any definition in this respect. That is the way capital gains is in fact characterised as an addition to income. So there is a fundamental problem about this as we see it. It is probably premature to pursue this matter further at this stage, but it is one that we will certainly be examining before this legislation is finally concluded and it is being dealt with in the other place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the Parliamentary Secretary can give us some further enlightenment on the precise effect of amendment Nos 4 and 5 and the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> policy rationale for in effect giving this exemption to people who are high income earners, that might change our view. But it is up to the Parliamentary Secretary, in the absence of the Treasurer (Mr Costello)&mdash;as usual&mdash;to tell us what he thinks this is all about.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Following on from the  comments of the honourable Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) on amendment No. 5, I do not equate capital gains with income, and I suspect that that will be the government's position on that. But I do have to agree with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition when he complains of the complexity and unintelligibility of these proposed amendments, and the short time we have had to look at their approximately 21 pages, for all their import. And I suspect we are not going to continue it tonight. But I think it is an abomination. This is 21 pages of very complex amendments to a bill amending tax laws. It is quite incomprehensible, but it is not unique in this place; it has happened with previous governments. But it is always a source of regret that the parliament should have to operate under these circumstances, particularly the House of Representatives. I have said before that we are an insignificant legislative chamber, despite our best intentions, and that we leave it to the Senate to do our dirty work, as it were.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did mention in my speech on the second reading that there are 15 separate, disparate tax measures involved here&mdash;some of great complexity, mostly acceptable, but deserving of a very detailed examination which we are prevented from giving in this place. I spoke in my speech on the second reading for the full 20 minutes, and I might have touched on three or four of the 15 measures. We can go through this arduous process in the consideration in detail stage, but it does not lend itself to that and I am sure you would not tolerate it too much, Mr Deputy Speaker, if we should try to do just that in the detail stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The order in which the other amendments are going to be dealt with is quite unintelligible. It is illogical. That might be a product of the late hour, because you do not want to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5294"> get into too much detail just prior to the adjournment&mdash;and I guess that is acceptable. I would have welcomed being acquainted of that fact if that is the reason. We are ignoring the first three government amendments and we are going to Nos 4 and 5, which is exceedingly strange. As I have already said, it is very hard to pick up the logic of that sort of reasoning. Add that to the complexity of the application of government amendment Nos 4 and 5 and we are in almost an impossible position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps overnight we might be able to gain further information and greater insights into all the amendments, but I doubt that. These are highly technical, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has already pointed out, and I would suspect that the people to whom I would wish to talk and from whom I would seek advice in the private professional sector may not even be aware of the detail, and  would not be available to talk about these amendments in any coherent way whatsoever before they come on for debate, presumably some time tomorrow afternoon. I do sympathise with the opposition in this context because I know that they have certain party commitments, which I do not have, in the morning. They have to go through the routine of party meetings. It makes it just that much more intolerable.</PARA>

The last time I spoke on this issue I quoted examples where young Aboriginal boys taken away from their families inevitably entered into a life of petty crime and on one occasion early death. Tonight I would like to quote from the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> report starting at page 143 on the effect of the Commonwealth government's policy on the stolen children. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following the 1951 Commonwealth-State Ministers Conference Paul Hasluck, the Minister for the newly created portfolio of Territories, urged the Commonwealth Government to adopt a national coordination role and set an example in the Northern Territory by taking active measures to encourage assimilation. Indigenous people of full descent as well as mixed descent people were now subjected to control.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Welfare Ordinance 1953</EMPHASIS>  repealed the 1918 Ordinance. It was intended to be the vehicle of assimilation. Its original intent was to move away from the protectionist approach to Aboriginal welfare and subject all Aboriginal people to the same welfare legislation as non-Indigenous people. Accordingly, it made no mention of race, referring instead to `wards'. A ward was any person who `by reason of his manner of living, his inability to manage his own affairs, his standard of social habit and behaviour, his personal associations . . . stands in need of special care'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Director of Welfare was made the guardian of all wards. People who were made wards were denied the most basic of human rights concerning their person and property. They could be taken into custody and removed to a reserve or institution and the Director could take control of any property they possessed. The Director's functions included maintaining a `Register of Wards', commonly known as `the stud book'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In response to concerns among non-Indigenous Territorians that they could be subject to wardship under the Ordinance, it was amended to make it quite clear that it was only designed to target Aboriginal people. This was done by specifying that people with voting rights could not be made wards. The Ordinance effectively excluded nearly everyone except Aboriginal people. Non-Indigenous children could only be dealt with under the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Child Welfare Ordinance 1958</EMPHASIS>  which permitted their removal only on the children's court finding of neglect or destitution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 1953 Ordinance entered into effect in 1957. It was accompanied by a blanket gazettal of wardship of all Aborigines of full descent, with a few notable exceptions. The Welfare Ordinance proceeded on the assumption that Aboriginal people of mixed descent had been assimilated although they could be the subject of individual declarations. Within a family or community some members might be wards and others not.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The presumption of assimilation made in the Welfare Ordinance must be assessed against the reality of the urban Aboriginal experience in the 1950s and 60s. Darwin at this time had the barest of public housing programs. There were no child care centres and very limited employment opportunities. The employment that was available to women&mdash;basically domestic service in the households of public servants&mdash;did not 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5295"> allow for a woman to work and at the same time care for her children.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">These conditions ensured that an urban Aboriginal family unit would fulfil the criteria for a declaration of wardship under the Ordinance. However, the result of a declaration itself caused profound social effects to come into play. Inevitably the whole family unit was not declared wards. Rather, only the children were. The children, once declared, were then removed to one of the mission stations. The result of the delivery of family services was then to effect the separation of the family `in the interests of the child'.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">These quotes again highlight the damage done to the Aboriginal people and culture due to federal government policy.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon in private members' business I was talking about the problem I have in my electorate and more widely in Queensland with the Stockmans franchise. I was speaking about one of the directors of that company, Mr McVerry, who was also director of a marketing company. You would think that a director of a marketing company would ask some of his franchisees, `Do they need more marketing help? Is there a problem with the goods being sold? Can we give you some sort of a hand with the business?' I certainly would and I suspect many people would, especially if they were serious about the franchise they were selling.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also went on to say that the directors of Stockmans&mdash;McVerry, James and Bennett&mdash;did not ask questions like that. They were very ready to vilify the outgoing franchisees, saying that it was a failure and `bad management', but then would look around for an unsuspecting investor and put them into the same store with the same pitiful support and same training. Then they would watch them fail as well. In short, I said that the directors were practising churning&mdash;sometimes three operators going through the one franchise business.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When these franchisees asked for helped they were told that they were bad managers and they had to work harder. Interestingly, none of the franchisees I spoke to ever failed in business before. Yet out of 22 Stockmans franchises 14 have either closed or are in difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The contract which bound the franchisees to Stockmans made more promises about training. When the directors of Stockmans told prospective franchisees about training and marketing support they made it out to be similar to that of the very successful food chain McDonald's: full training and full marketing support. Stockmans provided no training apart from a short introduction to the franchise and a visit to their Ipswich store.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Marketing was a joke. For a franchise fee of $50,000, a monthly payment of five per cent of the total gross revenue, called a franchise service fee, was asked for, and for that $500 a month for further marketing support the franchisees received no marketing support whatsoever. Even when businesses were struggling and they had to ask Stockmans for help and consultants were employed, the franchisees paid for the consultants. When Ashleigh Steel, my constituent, employed his own marketing consultant, he improved his turnover immeasurably.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what do we do with Stockmans? How do we regulate an industry that refuses to be regulated? How do we prosecute people who are wreaking havoc on small business operators? At this stage, we can say the damage is worth somewhere between $3 million and $4 million to small business operators and their families. I would like to see an extension of the definition of the Corporations Law and the application of `corporation' under the Corporations Law to include franchisees. This way directors of franchised companies would have to show due diligence with every franchisee. They would no longer be able to churn people through franchise agreements with no regard to financial viability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This will help the franchisees to seek satisfaction under the Australian Securities Commission. Directors of Stockmans have 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5296"> very conveniently put Stockmans Australian Cafe Holdings into administration. Interestingly, too, they have been able to hire the best accountants to help liquidate their companies and the best lawyers to mount counter suits to protect themselves. Not so the franchisees who have been bled dry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are other disturbing features about this franchise arrangement which I intend to pursue in the parliament such as the lack of transparency in nominated sources of purchasing and the level of charges placed on shop fittings by a company conveniently connected with some of the directors. On 5 August at a formal second meeting of creditors of the company in administration, the directors and some entities friendly to their cause were able to control the effects of motions passed at that meeting that gave these directors a second chance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On a wider front, I cannot accept the proposition of this state of affairs. The treatment of many people like the Steels, the Van Der Meers, the Gruszcynskis, the Riecks and the Banks whom I have spoken of today in small business is appalling. It should be solved but not by a voluntary code of practice. My preferred option would be to have some full regulatory regime for franchising. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="5296"><TITLE>Banking Industry</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In early 1983, Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser was ridiculed after warning pensioners they would be wise to hide their money under their beds if the Hawke Labor government came to power because it would be safer stuffed in their mattresses than in the banks. But, if we look back at what has happened to Australian banks since the Hawke Labor government set them on their course of deregulation, making them a law unto themselves, perhaps Mr Fraser was right.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last week the New South Wales government staged a banking forum in my electorate instigated by the state Minister for Fair Trading, Fay Lo Po'. The only problem was, the first time the minister was asked a really tough question at the forum relating to how 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the major banks are squeezing farmers and small business out of business, Minister Lo Po' was forced to back away. Quite rightly, she pointed out, banking practices are really more of a federal government responsibility. She could only tackle fairly minor consumer issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The big question relating to banking regulation and the lack thereof relates to the federal government and come under its jurisdiction. You have to ask why this government and the last one were so reluctant to do anything about banks apart from dishing out a bit of criticism here and there. Perhaps it has a lot to do with the fact that banks are among the major donors to political parties in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the banks are ripping off pensioners with absurdly high account keeping fees and evicting farmers from their properties, last financial year&mdash;the election year&mdash;they donated just over $1.2 million to political parties. Sixty&hyphen;one per cent of that went to the coalition. According to the Australian Electoral Commission, Westpac was by far the most generous, donating a total of $532,900 with $245,500 going to the ALP, $211,000 to the Liberals, $11,000 to the Democrats and $65,000 to the National Party. The figures make interesting reading. Of the big four banks, the Commonwealth was the only one that did not make any donations to major parties. ANZ donated $117,000 and the National Australia Bank donated $200,000 to its favourite parties. Seventy&hyphen;five per cent went to the coalition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a great tragedy that the federal government is not showing concern in relation to banks and their trading practices. In the state electorate of Bathurst alone, the Bathurst banking conference was told the local state member now has details of 250 banking disputes on his books which are unresolved. The message from the banking forum last Wednesday came loud and clear. It came from pensioners and the CWA struggling to get by as the major banks close their country branches forcing people to travel long distances to do their banking or grapple with high&hyphen;tech electronic or phone banking services they simply do not understand.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5297">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It came from business operators who have had their assets seized and sold up with little or no warning, disposed of at below market prices further depressing the rural economy. It came from farmers who simply cannot understand why banks are still charging them ridiculously high interest rates while bending over backwards to urban real estate wheelers and dealers. It came from people like Claire Boardman, a respected rural councillor based in Orange, who told how the banks are openly discriminating against farmers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, one farmer with assets worth $800,000 went to his bank to apply for one of its business loans it had advertised at an interest rate of 7.9 per cent. The bank told him that he could not have it because he was a farmer and a farmer is not a small business. Have you ever heard anything so absurd: that  a farm is not a small business? Ms Boardman told the forum that farmers are regarded as the second most safe group for banks to lend money to because they always have a land asset to back them up. So this talk of farmers paying higher interest rates because of the risk involved is only an excuse for banks to ride on the farmers' backs and cream off the profits from the agricultural sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Businesses lack faith in our banks, I am certain, and this is playing a major part in the poor economic performance of the country. To generate jobs and to grow, businesses need to generate money. Normally that involves borrowing money, but business is scared. At the end of last year business bankruptcies had soared to their highest level on record. Loan insurers blame this problem on poor management by the banks and also their aggressive lending practices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australians are fed up with the banks and their immoral practices. It is time that the federal government did something about it&mdash;or are they, and the opposition also, so much in hock to their banking industry supporters to do anything about it in the interests of the so-called battlers: the Labor Party's battlers, the coalition's battlers, rural and urban alike?</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="5297"><TITLE>Cooked Chicken Meat Imports</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last week Labor and Democrat members attended 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a meeting in my electorate of Bowman to debate the issue of imported cooked chicken meat. Even though I was invited to this meeting, I was not given the opportunity to speak. Therefore, I will rectify this situation now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What alarmed me most about the words used and emotions evoked by the opposition and Democrats at the public meeting was that they were the good guys; they were the ones whom the chicken farmers could trust. Nothing could be further from the truth. The truth is that the Labor Party and the Democrats have no credibility whatsoever when it comes to this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the Labor Party had managed another term in office, this meeting and those held all over the country would never have taken place. Why? Because Labor signed off on the issue in November 1995. That is right: Labor sold our chicken growers out, without due consideration to the side effects. They painted themselves as the industry's white knights riding in to save the day. In fact, the shadow minister stood up and tried to convince the meeting that the Labor Party had nothing to do with the importation of cooked chicken meat. He was backtracking faster than Bill Hayden on the need for a Governor&hyphen;General. Hayden once said that the position was not needed and would cost too much. The next minute he was doing the job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Two years ago the Labor government virtually wrote off the Australian chicken industry and now, while in opposition, they have the audacity to feign interest. I do not disagree with their arguments; I do wonder why it has taken them so long to come around. As I have said, unfortunately I was not given the opportunity to address my own constituents in my own electorate. It is for this reason I again rise today to put my stance on record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am opposed to the importation of cooked chicken meat from areas where chickens are prone to the deadly Newcastle disease. There can be no good reason for us to put into jeopardy our own chicken meat industry. I believe that we should let science decide on the future of this issue and protect our industry. It is far 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5298"> too important for us to be second&hyphen;guessing the experts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the past 14 months I have visited the chicken farms in my electorate and talked to the growers. I can understand their anxiety over this issue, and I totally sympathise with them. The chicken growers in my electorate and that of Fadden, to the south of my electorate, are not inefficient. Their work practices are amongst the best in Australia, and their product is excellent. Is it little wonder that they question the move made by the former administration to even consider bringing in overseas product that could conceivably wipe out the local industry?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of those I talked to are not concerned just about the competition. What they are concerned about is the threat of the disease. And who can blame them? Australia and New Zealand are the only countries totally free  from the deadly Newcastle disease&mdash;a disease that could wipe out all the hatcheries in my electorate within days, even hours; a disease that the former administration overlooked when signing off on the deal in 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I received a letter today by fax from a constituent of mine who was at the meeting and was wondering why I did not speak at it. He rightfully wants know the opinion of his federal member on this issue. I will gladly tell him and put it on the public record that I will stand firm with my local growers and support their cause. I commend the chicken growers of my electorate for their stance on this issue and their efforts to highlight the problems. I give them my complete support.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="5298"><TITLE>Cooked Chicken Meat Imports

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am quite excited, having heard the member for Bowman (Mrs West) stand in this place and take the opposition's position on the issue of the importation of cooked chicken meat. I am delighted and I look forward to her support when the issue really comes to the crunch in this place. However, I would take a brief moment to correct her. It is untrue that Senator Bob Collins, the former Minister for 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Primary Industries and Energy, ever signed off on an approval for the importation of cooked chicken meat. If indeed that had been the case, those imports would be occurring right now. That was never the case. Indeed, under the current legislation, the current arrangements, the minister of the day does not even have the final say. What AQIS does do, very smartly, is seek the minister's imprimatur before making a final decision. But it never ever gained the imprimatur of Bob Collins.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John Anderson, the new minister, made certain commitments prior to the election. But, having gained office, he was very, very quick to give the decision the tick. Standing in this place and on a number of other public occasions, he has assured Australians generally that the importation applications would be approved. I suggest that the member for Bowman should be directing her anger not at those organisers of the meeting in Queensland but at her own minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, tonight I want to speak about an issue even more important than that of the importation of cooked chicken meat. Tonight I want to use the small amount of time available to me to join with the 20 opposition members before me who have used the time available to them in recent adjournment debates to share with the House some of the heart-rending submissions given by indigenous Australians who have appeared before the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission during its recent inquiry into the practice of forcibly removing indigenous children from their parents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bringing them home</EMPHASIS>, the product of the commission's inquiry, is a document that every Australian should read. But, unfortunately, not every Australian will have that opportunity. By reading in this place as many of the submissions as is possible, the opposition hopes that more Australians than would otherwise be the case will hear these terrible stories. We also hope that those who do hear them will come to better understand the great injustices which have been perpetrated upon Aboriginal Australians over many years. These were children who were supposedly being taken away for their own good. Let me 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5299"> share with the House one witness's account of the sort of protection they were given once they had been removed from their families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to read from the evidence of a woman who in the 1960s was removed from her parents at the age of 13 and who, after originally being placed in the Parramatta Girls Home, was placed in a foster home. The submission can be found on page 168 of the report and reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The thing that hurts the most is that they didn't care about who they put us with. As long as it looked like they were doing their job, it just didn't matter. They put me with one family and the man of the house used to come down and use me whenever he wanted to . . . Being raped over and over and there was no&hyphen;one I could turn to. They were supposed to look after me and protect me but, no&hyphen;one ever did.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This was a girl just 13 years of age. Then there is the submission of a South Australian woman who was forcibly removed from her family as a baby in the 1940s. She was consistently raped in a work placement in Colebrook. Her evidence reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I remember when my sister come down and visited me and I was reaching out. There was no one there. I was just reaching out and I could see her standing there and I couldn't tell her that I'd been raped. And I never told anyone for years and years.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Her evidence can be found on page 148 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bringing them home</EMPHASIS> . I am very keen to point out that the damage caused over many years is not confined just to women or to the early decades of this century. On the same page we find the words of a male who was removed from his family during the 1970s at age eight and was also the victim of sexual assault over many years. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There's still a lot of unresolved issues within me. One of the biggest ones is I cannot really love anyone no more. I'm sick of being hurt. Every time I used to get close to anyone they were just taken away from me.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In a recent address to a Sydney Rotary club luncheon, Ross Wilson, the Victorian TAB Corp chief, presented to his audience some disturbing data on Australia's addiction to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> gambling. Australian punters will lose over $11.5 billion over the next year or $640 for every man, woman and child in this country. This estimate is $1.2 billion or 12 per cent higher than the forecast gambling losses of $10.3 billion for 1996-97 and $1.9 billion higher than the $9.6 billion lost the previous year, 1995-96. </PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The loss of $11.5 billion over the coming year is double that of the $5.9 billion lost only four years ago. As a nation, we now spend more on gambling than we do on beer. It is interesting, but for informed observers not surprising that, according to Mr Wilson, since the opening of Melbourne's permanent Crown Casino Tab Corps's gaming income or punters' losses have reached record levels. Gambling turnover is now in total approaching $65 billion annually. It has trebled in a little over two decades. Most&mdash;75 to 80 per cent&mdash;of those frequenting Australian casinos are locals. Frequently, it is those who are least able to afford to lose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Earmarking of gambling revenue for philanthropic and worthwhile programs, as we are currently seeing in New South Wales over debate ensuing from the government budget, is not in my opinion conducive to moderation in relation to gambling behaviour. They should instead be funded out of general revenue. I note that a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> Morgan poll on attitudes to gambling found that only 10 per cent of respondents thought gambling a useful way to raise taxes. The same survey conducted last year found that a staggering 10 per cent or 1.3 million Australians admit that gambling has caused problems for their friends or for their families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those who feel that they ought to rail in some way against taxation reform, one other argument that ought to be added to the already persuasive ones for reforming our tax system is that gambling revenue is now being used by state governments to compensate for a decline in stamp duty and payroll tax receipts. State governments this year will collect in excess of $3.2 billion from the proceeds of gambling. Offering excitement, exhilaration and the time of your life, the casino culture now rapidly enveloping the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5300"> country is a development about which we should all have a heightened sense of concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look throughout history for those societies that are in crisis and go through some considerable degree of turmoil, there are a number of consistent characteristics. The first is a preoccupation with death, whether it be by suicide or euthanasia. Australia, having the fourth highest youth suicide rate in the industrialised world and the highest in the OECD, already fits the first category. As all members here know, we are currently going through a debate about euthanasia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A second indicator is a society that starts to divide along race lines and engages in what might be described as a race debate. Few could doubt that Australia has done that over the last year. The third is the elevation of gambling to having the status of a religion. I think there are some state governments that have sought to elevate gambling to a level that simply encourages a degree of rampant individualism and a set of values that are not going to provide much hope or confidence for young Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem is not that young people have not learned our values; it is that they have. I think all governments and those in the community currently arguing the need for certain gambling institutions to maintain their tax free status ought to consider where society is headed generally and the contribution in particular that gambling is making toward it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The two most important matters in people's minds today are jobs and job security. This budget does not address either of them; in fact, it does the opposite. The Howard government came to office with a promise to make people `relaxed and comfortable'. In its first 15 months it again has done the opposite. It steadfastly refuses to set an unemployment rate target and it has slowed down the rate of growth in the economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a government without leadership. It is the lack of leadership from Prime Minister Howard that is helping to destroy public confidence and so generating insecurity. The fact that the Prime Minister refuses to set a target rate for unemployment highlights in the public mind that this government, with this Prime Minister, does not have sufficient confidence in its own policies or its own performance to risk setting a target.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an `us and them' budget. It does nowt for industry and nothing to generate jobs. It is a budget that will make life harder for the aged, the sick and the unemployed. They are the trifecta that has always been the target of Liberal&hyphen;National Party governments&mdash;from the McMahon government's 50c per week increase for pensioners, to the Fraser government's attempt to abolish funeral benefits and impose a tax on newspaper boys' earnings, to this government's incredible strategy to solve unemployment by forcing 10,000 young Australians to work for the dole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us never forget that Prime Minister Howard of today was Treasurer Howard of yesterday. The legacy of Treasurer Howard that we inherited in 1983 was a $9.6 billion prospective budget deficit. If we take the deficit from that government's final budget before we came to  power in 1983, as a proportion of GDP its equivalent in today's terms would be $28.6 billion. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5305"> We inherited, along with that legacy, double digit inflation running at 12 per cent. That level of inflation was exceeded only during the Korean war. We inherited double digit unemployment. We inherited what was, for the first time in 30 years, negative growth. That was the great achievement of the Fraser government: being able to turn almost 30 years of continuous growth into negative growth. We inherited interest rates of 20 per cent plus&mdash;interest rates and cash rates that have not been surpassed since.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we compare the record on employment, in our government's last year in office employment grew by 176,000. In the first year of this government, total employment grew by 89,000&mdash;half of the growth under the previous Labor government. Male full&hyphen;time employment in Labor's last year in office grew by 57,000. In this government's first year, it fell by 12,600. The number of long&hyphen;term unemployed fell by 45,000 in Labor's last year in office. In this government's first year in office, long&hyphen;term unemployment has grown by 44,000. The Treasurer claims the budget is directed at helping families, boosting small business, creating jobs and encouraging saving. But the mantra and the rhetoric do not solve the problem, no matter how many times they are chanted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But let us turn to the rebate for savings, the so&hyphen;called savings initiative. Scrapping the superannuation co&hyphen;contribution scheme will mean that workers now in their mid&hyphen;30s, on average weekly earnings, will each lose around $110,000 from the lump sum they would have received on retirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We turn to the rebate for savings&mdash;a two&hyphen;stage introduction. It does not do anything for anybody now. No&hyphen;one would get one cent from this initiative until the second half of 1999 because the tax year is 1998&hyphen;99 and the rebate will become available in 1999&hyphen;2000. No&hyphen;one benefits anything from that. It is a 7&half; per cent rebate from 1 July 1998 and a full 15 per cent rebate from 1 July 1999. The rebate applies to the first $3,000 of taxable income from savings, with a maximum rebate of $450. From the Treasury example, the rebate will apply to the whole of the interest earned on $60,000 invested at five per cent. I can assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, I have few, if any, constituents in my electorate who have $60,000 invested. A family able to put $5,000 aside for savings earning five per cent interest would receive a tax rebate of only 72c per week when the ultimate receive the full amount at the end of 1999&hyphen;2000. This savings initiative will not assist savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn now to the deferred pension bonus plan. For the life of me, I cannot understand why it has been defined as a pension bonus plan. This is really a proposal to reduce pension payments. It is not about equity or fairness for pensioners or people likely to receive pensions; it is about reducing outlays by the Department of Social Security. There is a bonus of 9.4 per cent of basic age or service pension entitlements for each year of pension deferral, up to a maximum of five years, implemented from July of next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The deferral is possible if the person continues with gainful employment for at least 25 hours per week and it can be paid as a lump sum on pension take&hyphen;up. The maximum bonus is $21,251 for a single person, or $35,450 for a couple. A single person would be foregoing some $51,000 of pension to receive a payment of $21,251 after five years, if he or she lives that long.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We look at the great problem of unemployment in this country. A lot of attention is given to youth unemployment, and rightly so, but there is a terrible problem among mature age people. The mature age allowance helps address that in a way. It is the mature age  unemployed&mdash;those people 45 to 50 years of age and over&mdash;who are so demeaned by being 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5306"> unemployed, many of them for the first time in their lives. They are more likely to have liabilities, kids at high school, problems with moving and lesser mobility for moving to other places to find work than the young Australians have. They are the people who would fill the jobs that are created by those retiring at age 65.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This proposal, the so&hyphen;called deferred pension bonus plan, as I said, is aimed at reducing pension outlays. That proposal actually holds mature age people out of work, decreasing their opportunities to get employment. I define it as a `work till you drop' plan. If you can keep going for another three, four or five years, and if you have not passed on, then you may be able to get the reward. For most it will be a short&hyphen;lived reward. It denies job opportunities for mature age people who otherwise would replace retirees and it exacerbates Australia's unemployment problem. Those who benefit from this scheme are likely to be better off and they do not need help as much as young families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We turn to child care in families. This government is rich in rhetoric on families. They utter the words ad nauseam but they do not practise the policies that help families. The most important things for a family are an income and to have somebody at work supporting the family. The policies of this government are slow growth rates and increasing unemployment which damage families and family structure, as will the cuts to child&hyphen;care funding&mdash;$500 million last year and another $321 million this year. That will reduce the number of child&hyphen;care places available and the amount of non&hyphen;work related care which is subsidised. The basic fact is that child care is being made unaffordable for a lot of Australian families. Parents have to pay more, whether it be for reduced quality of care or higher fees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we turn to the sick and to the increase in the cost of pharmaceutical benefits. The new drugs tax is based on drugs which have a similar clinical effect. It is very different from our government's initiative, which was based on drugs which have identical chemical make&hyphen;up. The $500 million cut from the pharmaceutical benefits scheme in last year's budget and another $700 million cut in this year's budget will worsen the burden upon people needing medical care. Australians will pay more for the latest, the safest and best medication. People will be increasingly forced to choose between the safest and the cheapest medication.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That new system takes effect from 1 February 1998. It is going to be implemented against six drug groups for treating high blood pressure, hypertension, depression, cholesterol and ulcers. The government will only provide a full subsidy for the cheapest drug in each of the six groups. That increase in costs, and the pressure upon people to choose between the best and the cheapest, is going to cause a great deal of trauma amongst aged and sick people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Going to the other end of the age scale, there is the work for the dole scheme. Now, somehow, that is a brilliant scheme&mdash;I do not understand the government's mathematics, but they must be absolutely brilliant when we have got 900,000 unemployed people, 90,000 are youth unemployed, and they are going to solve 90,000 unemployed youth by forcing 10,000 to go to work for the dole! A lot of debate has already passed about that, and more will occur in the future, so I will not dwell upon it here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to compare that to the cuts in the federal Public Service. This government is railing against unemployed people and applying more and more pressure to them, in many cases for jobs that just do not exist. Those on the other side in this committee and on other side in the main chamber know that very well. They can go through the posturing, but they know deep in their hearts&mdash;the same as we know&mdash;that for most of those people the jobs are just not there, no matter how hard they search. In the Public Service, 12,600 jobs have already gone, with 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5307"> 16,500 more to go with the closure of the CES, Social Security, Medicare and tax offices, mainly in rural and regional Australia. Add to that the 20,000 jobs to be lost from Telstra and another 8,000 jobs to go from Defence. And to each of those figures add the multiplier effect, which is at least 1&half; to one and up to two to one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My accounting friends in the accounting and financial advising business in the Hunter say to me that business is absolutely flat, that numerous of their clients have not seen business as flat as it is and has been for the past few months. On 24 May, 11 days after the budget, I attended one of the largest clubs in my electorate. They were just concluding the quietest week that club had experienced in the past 12 months. They are the hard facts; they are anecdotal, but they are the hard facts that I find when I move around my region. So at the hands of the 15 months of hard labour under Prime Minister Howard, we see not only a downturn in growth and increased unemployment, but a hopelessness, a growing insecurity and a lack of confidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to say something about some of the individual members of the government. I will not name them, but I am sure other members in this committee will recognise them. This is an arrogant, uncaring government, from the Prime Minister down. It is a government devoid of leadership, a government that clearly does not understand the consequences of its decisions. Somebody said to me the other day, `Well, you have got to understand that this government is like a dog chasing the car. It has caught the car; but, having caught the car, it does not know what to do with it.' When I watch some of the ministers perform in the chamber I can relate to that, I can understand that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ministers are not across their portfolios. Ministers display an arrogance, and at times a pomposity, that I have never seen before in all my experience&mdash;and I have seen quite a few ministers. Ministers do not answer representations. When one makes representations on behalf of constituents, they are entitled to get a response; but, no, you do not get a letter. After quite some weeks&mdash;even months&mdash;you get an answer back from a third&hyphen; or fourth&hyphen;level staffer, or some minor character in a department, but not a response from the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I make ministerial representations, that is what I expect and what I always practised. If a member or a senator wrote to me, that member or senator was entitled to, and demanded, a response from the minister&mdash;and they always got it. I did not have to agree with what they wrote, I did not have to like what they wrote sometimes, but I had a parliamentary and ministerial responsibility to ensure that that member or senator representing his or her constituents received a reply from me. That is not the case with ministers of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me turn to my electorate and the losses that are occurring in the Hunter and the central coast. Belmont CES is closed. Belmont Medicare is to be closed. Newcastle immigration office is closed. Swansea Visiting Service of the Department of Social Security is closed. Amalgamation of Charlestown Department of Social Security and Charlestown CES is in process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Add to that the centralisation of payroll facilities in the Department of Social Security, and DEETYA and Taxation are coming down to about three centres each across Australia, as I understand it. All of those changes together mean that there are massive losses occurring across our region from federal public offices. The Newcastle area office of DEETYA, the area for which stretches from the Hawkesbury to Coffs Harbour and out to the west, is to be abolished and replaced by a state office. It is back to the old structure of eight years ago&mdash;a head office 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5308"> in Sydney with a few troops and instead of there being 120 staff in Newcastle there may be 15 or 16.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those jobs in regional Australia generate other jobs. They are the jobs in regional Australia that provide tertiary employment, as you, Mr Deputy Speaker, know very well. They are the jobs that are sparse and much needed in regional Australia. Three hundred and seventy five jobs are going in the Hunter and central coast regions, in my electorate, from federal offices. You can add to that at least another 375 from the multiplier effect, and I am being conservative. That means a reduction in the quality of service to the constituents that I represent, and all of us represent, through that region. It means longer delays, more mistakes and poorer service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not the BHP closure, which is two years away; this is federal government abolition of jobs in regional Australia. It is hitting hard and it is hitting where it hurts most&mdash;the people who need those jobs in our communities. I ask the government to at least offset the damage it is doing in abolishing these federal jobs. I cannot change the government; they are hell bent on doing this. I am sure there are also members on the government side who are very unhappy about this&mdash;some of them will feel the sting of it a bit later. I ask the government to think of the people who live in those areas and to think of the small businesses that depend upon the trade from those people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask the government to ensure that the headquarters, payroll and staffing of the PEPE, the Public Employment Placement Enterprise, be located in the Hunter, to ensure that a new teleservice centre for the Department of Social Security be located in the Hunter, and to ensure that at least one of the payroll centres in the Department of Social Security, which is going to Parramatta&mdash;of all places&mdash;be located in the Hunter, and similarly with DEETYA and Tax. This will at least be some compensation for the jobs that are being abolished by this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, I ask for the constituency used Medicare office at Belmont. This is a new office. It was opened in July last year at considerable expense. Its growth rate is 20 per cent and it is continuing to grow. Thousands upon thousands of people are going to be inconvenienced by the closure of that office. Already, almost 6,000 people have signed petitions and there will be many more thousands. I ask the Minister to think of those people&mdash;not of me, forget that I am a member of the opposition&mdash;and remember that he has humanity and that he has a responsibility to everybody in the community and not just to government members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I read that rural Medicare offices will remain and that Medicare offices further down the central coast will remain. They will not be affected. The petition for Belmont reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your petitioners request the House to require the government to ensure that Belmont Medicare office remains open.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Similarly, I read that the Family Resource Centre at Wyong, which services my electorate, is to be closed. Its funding is to be cut out at the beginning of next year as a result of the government's decision to abolish funding for family resource centres. ITRAC at Wyong provides an excellent service across several electorates across all of the central coast. It provides information to services such as the legal centre and the Central Coast Tenants Advice Service. It provides for better preparation and coordination of services in that area&mdash;services at the grassroots level where expertise is needed by all of those voluntary organisations. I ask that that be allowed to continue.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5309">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, when you look at the budget, do not turn to me&mdash;I have expressed my view&mdash;but think about the pensioners and what they think of the budget.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to vigorously support this Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1997&hyphen;98 and in doing so oppose with equal vigour the amendment moved by the honourable member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans). I support the bill because this second budget of the coalition is a strategic part of the government's plan to help the families of Eden-Monaro, to create real jobs, to boost small business and to encourage savings. It will also repay a fair bit of debt which, in itself, will translate into great benefits for the people of my electorate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition has made a great deal of noise in relation to unemployment in this budget. In fact, the first part of their amendment claims that the budget `does nothing for jobs'. Therefore, let me spend some time comparing our approach to reducing unemployment with the opposition's dismal record and their supposed solutions. We all remember the one million unemployed people of the early 1990s. They were unemployed as a direct result of Labor's recession we had to have, the recession purposely induced to overcome their high interest rate regime. I will come back to that aspect a little later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor finally got a bit concerned about the high level of unemployment and decided the way to solve this was to create the magic pudding called Working Nation. This magic pudding did not have threepences and sixpences in it, it had dollars by the millions. In fact, there were a couple of billion dollars. `Spend, spend, spend,' they said, `that will fix unemployment.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my electorate of Eden-Monaro a few organisations were rubbing their hands together as these labour market programs were thrown around. I recall back in 1995 being told by a number of these organisations that they had been contacted by the department and told that there was all this money to spend so could they throw some sort of project together that the department could fund. Labor's solution was to write big cheques for programs that were short&hyphen; 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5310"> sighted and that provided only very short-term jobs, after which they were thrown back on the unemployment queues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition also claims that they created 700,000 jobs during this period. Their definition of a job was of someone being paid by the government to attend one of their labour market programs. If someone over a one- or two-year period was enrolled in, say, three or four of these programs then that was counted as three or four jobs. What a joke! That is not creating jobs. That is simply moving people off unemployment into government subsidised programs and then the government claims it has created jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the then government created was a lot of artificial positions paid for by the taxpayer, purely and simply to get a reduction in the horrendous unemployment figures they were responsible for as a result of the recession we had to have. In the course of this absolutely wasted exercise, they spent a couple of billion dollars they did not have. If directors of a company had spent shareholders' money in that fashion, the directors would not only be sacked but they probably would also face serious charges. We all know that the taxpayers, being the shareholders, well and truly sacked the directors in March last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the opposition's record on unemployment. Our strategy is somewhat different. Our first task was to get the economy back in order. We inherited a virtually bankrupt organisation. If the spending had continued at the same rate we would have been out the back door quick smart.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will touch on that overall spending regime for a minute. We all know that the budget we inherited was in deficit to the tune of $10.3 billion. What needs to be understood and remembered is that that went on for five consecutive years, but at a greater level. Budget paper No. 1, at page 2&hyphen;63, shows revenue and expenditure for all financial years going back to 1960&hyphen;61. It makes quite interesting reading. It shows that in 1995&hyphen;96 the overexpenditure was $10.3 billion, as I have just mentioned; in 1994&hyphen;95, the overexpenditure was $13.1 billion; in 1993&hyphen;94, it was $17.1 billion; in 1992&hyphen;93, it was $17 billion; and in 1991&hyphen;92, it was $11.5 billion&mdash;a grand total for the five years of $69 billion of overexpenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those opposite say that that is okay because, as a percentage of GDP, it is nothing. That is nonsense! As a percentage of GDP, those overexpenditures represent 2.1, 2.9, four, 4.2 and three per cent of GDP&mdash;an average of 3.2 per cent for the five years. Those opposite also make claims that they inherited a worse situation back in 1983. We have just heard the member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) make that accusation yet again. But that is not so; he obviously cannot read.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was quite interested in his claim, and I took the time to look at some of the figures. Looking at the last five years leading up to Labor taking office in 1983, you will see a deficit of $3.1 billion in 1982&hyphen;83, and a surplus of $0.5 billion in 1981&hyphen;82. The budget in 1980&hyphen;81 was balanced. There was a deficit of $1.2 billion in 1979&hyphen;80, and a deficit of $2.3 billion in 1978&hyphen;79. This gives a total deficit of $6.2 billion for the five years. Compare this with the $69 billion deficit for Keating's last five years. I do not think that there has been a ten&hyphen;fold increase in the ensuing period. In fact, the overall budget went up by just over double. In terms of percentage of GDP, the average for the last five years of the Fraser government was 0.9 per cent&mdash;once again, substantially less than the 3.2 per cent of Labor's last five years. No matter how you look at it, the figures show gross mismanagement of the economy by the former government.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5311">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said, our strategy is somewhat different. Our first two budgets have gone a long way to rebuilding the foundations of our economy. We have seen already the benefit of this rebuilding in a substantial drop in interest rates. This has meant the equivalent of over $290 per month in savings on an average home mortgage of $100,000. There is nothing that any government could do that is more basic than helping families with their mortgages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other great beneficiary of the interest rate drop is small business. Small business was decimated in the early 1990s with interest rates of well over 20 per cent. I remember paying 21.75 per cent on my overdraft in my business during that time. If ever there was a disincentive to invest, grow and employ, it was those exorbitant interest rates, and I knew it only too well. Small business interest rates are now down to around nine per cent. I would like to see them lower than that and, with the increase in competition, I think that will occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These lower rates, combined with low inflation, sensible industrial relations laws and a reduction in red tape, are the four key elements which will help small business. These are the four things that small business wanted us to address before last year's election. They have all been addressed, with substantial improvement shown. But the benefit of those changes is still coming. As much as people want to see miracles overnight, the reality is different. Small business suffered so badly in the roller&hyphen;coaster of interest rates under Labor that it is no wonder it is being cautious about investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With interest rates steadily decreasing over the past year and inflation stabilised at less than two per cent, businesses are now feeling some confidence about the future, and the benefit of that confidence will come over the next 12 months. That process will translate into real jobs&mdash;not artificial ones, but real, substantial jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will digress from my prepared speech in this debate to say that I have seen it very recently in my electorate at the Bega Co&hyphen;op. Over the last year, the members of the co&hyphen;op made the decision that they would invest $20 million in a packaging plant. They have increased their export of cheeses, et cetera, from nothing to $4 million worth of exports in the space of a very short period of time. The next big step is to do their own cutting and slicing and those sorts of things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They did not invest that $20 million lightly. They had to have the confidence that interest rates were going to be kept down so that they could afford to go into that investment and chase those overseas markets. It is a great investment for the lower south coast and it will probably generate something like 150 jobs in Bega over the next few years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because those opposite have made such a noise about jobs, I read the contribution to the budget debate by the honourable member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson), the opposition spokesperson on employment. As the member for Batman made so much noise, I thought that he would have something positive to contribute, but it was not so. He had absolutely nothing to contribute, except 20 minutes of whining and whinging.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only hint of what he would do was just what the Labor Party did before&mdash;more spending, more artificial jobs, more debt. The members of the Labor Party cannot get it through their heads that it did not work. The member for Batman and his mates have never created a real job in their life&mdash;and it shows. They do not know the feeling of risking savings, developing a business and employing people&mdash;and it shows. When I look at the waste that occurred between 1991 and 1996 and I think of how that government expenditure could have been used, I nearly despair. Those billions of dollars could have done so much good.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5312">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My electorate of Eden&hyphen;Monaro could have benefited substantially if those funds had been directed towards good infrastructure projects instead of mickey mouse labour market programs. It would have taken only a small proportion of that wasted money to build a new port at Eden, to upgrade infrastructure that would have helped to get a softwood mill in Bombala, to accelerate the fast train proposal between Sydney and Canberra, and to improve the Princes Highway along the coast and into the mountains. My electorate would have moved along very nicely with projects like these if that government money had been directed in that way rather than in the nonsensical way that it was.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These projects are the priorities for the people of Eden&hyphen;Monaro. Recently, I contacted Bob Mansfield, who is working out of the Prime Minister's office and breaking down some of the bureaucratic barriers that are there to get major projects going. We have wasted time over the last five or six years in not getting into these areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is particularly so in the south east where the hardwood industry has been decimated&mdash;more recently, by the Labor Premier of New South Wales who continually pre&hyphen;empts decisions. He does not want to wait for scientific work to be carried out in the forests. He runs around declaring national parks before anybody has done all the studies. The industry is thus being decimated at a greater rate than it should be. We could have had these other projects in place if some of that government money had been spent in a sensible way on infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will move on these projects and our budget will set the climate that will allow these types of projects to be addressed in the years to come. We will make sure that, when we have paid back some of the debt, that the money we have is directed towards job creation projects like infrastructure, and not artificial ones that move people off queues into short&hyphen;term programs, back onto queues, and then take the credit for creating two jobs because they have been given two programs to deal with in the first six months or something like that. This is a responsible budget and it must be supported.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another sector of Eden&hyphen;Monaro that had it tough under the previous government and was desperate to see a change was the rural sector. As well as being small businesses suffering under high interest rates, that sector, particularly on the Monaro, has had the added burden of drought&mdash;to the extent that we have never seen before on many properties. There are dams and springs that are dry for the first time in memory for long&hyphen;time owners on the Monaro. Stock prices have been way down and many farmers have had to sell stock before winter really hits because they have no feed and cannot afford to buy it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These difficulties have been recognised by the government, who last year increased drought assistance and in this budget allocated $200 million over four years towards an integrated rural package. In recent days I have been able to meet with the minister and keep him informed of the situation on the Monaro and he will await any recommendations from the New South Wales state government, which is currently assessing the circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our government will be ensuring the farmers of Eden&hyphen;Monaro are assisted to get back on their feet. Wool, sheep, beef and dairy products are major income earners for Eden&hyphen;Monaro and I want to see them play a big part in Australia's growth. Further micro&hyphen;economic reform will also be a priority in the coming year. Things like waterfront reform will be crucial to the increased exports of our produce.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Markets are opening up every day. We have seen the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Fischer) spend a lot of time overseas since we came to government, and it has been well used time. We have seen tariffs coming down in many countries. There are trade&hyphen;offs happening. People 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5313"> have this perception that we are knocking down tariffs in Australia and our competitors are not, making our exports harder, but it is not the case. We are having big wins in a number of areas. We have seen, in places like Mexico and India, tariffs on wool and other products coming down and we are really opening up new markets. Those sorts of new markets are going to be of great benefit to the farmers of Eden&hyphen;Monaro, who have been the producers of some of the finest merino wool, sheep and beef. Our dairy products from the south coast are really becoming a major export item as they make inroads into the new markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mentioned the Bega Co&hyphen;op before. I was told, only the other day, that one of the areas that they have managed to get their cheese into is the English market. Never before had another country been able to get a produce in under their own brand name. There are a lot of cheeses from New Zealand and other places that enter the English market, but they go in and they are shown as Sainsbury's or Tesco or something like that in England. We have now got Bega with that Bega brand name actually in the supermarkets in England. I think that is a great thing and there will be a lot more of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the savings area the opposition have really lost the plot. Everywhere that they look for examples, they try to say, `Well, this is the situation and these people will not be able to take the benefit for the savings plan that they put in place in the budget.' That is the whole point, the country has not been saving because there has not been the incentive there. What this is all about is creating that incentive to save.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One group of people in my electorate who will benefit substantially from this measure are the self&hyphen;funded retirees. I have a lot of self&hyphen;funded retirees down the coast who have contributed enormously to the growth of this country. They have done the right thing by planning and putting away for their retirement. They would have got nothing from the l&hyphen;a&hyphen;w law tax cuts that became superannuation under the previous government. They would have got nothing out of that. They get a great boost out of this savings plan. I think it is a start. I would like to see a lot more for the self&hyphen;funded retirees, but it is certainly a substantial start for them, along with the other measures that we introduced in the budget last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our strategy is based on substance. It is based on creating the right circumstances for private enterprise&mdash;small and large businesses&mdash;to invest, to risk their capital, to find new markets, to grow and to employ. These are the strategies for the businesses, for the families, for the people of Eden&hyphen;Monaro.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am disappointed that the honourable member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) is not preceding me because it was one of the reasons I thought it would be rather fun to speak on this budget debate. I say `fun' because I think it is terribly important that people understand the simplistic nonsense that I find she is repeating around the country. Sadly, there are a number of people who are taking to her rhetoric and believing that, in some way, there is an alternative.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I guess it is also unfortunate because, in looking at the budget and where we are going in Australia, a lot of people need to understand the world in which we live. I want to come from the world in which we live back to the budget itself in the few remarks I make.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first aspect is one that we are all conscious of but do not have much to do with, and that is the expanding membership of ASEAN and the importance of ASEAN as a group of countries to us and to each other. Beyond that, the only two countries of the world who have more than a billion people, who are just outside the borders of ASEAN, also impact enormously on us. Of course, Australia's closest trading partner, Japan, is also outside the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5314"> ASEAN grouping but, with the tigers of Asia, it plays an enormously significant part in the world scene as we move into the 21st century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People generally, looking at the ASEAN countries, think that Australia is still much more important financially. We are obviously a more sophisticated country. We have remarkable economic capability, we have done reasonably well in education and people, rightly, look at our achievements and say that we are still, in many respects, a society which can be proud of where we are and look with confidence into the next century and know that we are still going to have an edge on many others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I see the world, I do not think that is so. By looking at the world around us, I want to identify firstly, in economic terms, some of the problems that I think people like the member for Oxley tend to dismiss too glibly. In the seven members of ASEAN up until now, you would see countries with a GDP of about $750 billion. That GDP covers a population somewhere in excess of 400 million people. If you then move from the GDP of the seven to the GDP of the 10, taking into account the accession of Laos, Cambodia and Burma&mdash;or Myanmar&mdash;to ASEAN, you would find that the GDP has only been increased by $50 billion to $55 billion, but it still is somewhere in excess of $800 billion. The population base has gone up to towards the 500 million mark.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at that before we start looking at that wider world. Australia has a very small population of 18 million. To think complacently that we can draw boundaries and ignore altogether the reality of that world indefinitely into the future is extraordinarily foolish. It is just not on. Whatever prejudices people might have, they need to understand that those Asian countries inevitably look on us as a fortunate country. Every time a new cargo of boat people&mdash;if you call people a cargo&mdash;arrives on our shores, it is partly a reflection of the same opportunities which for generations they have seen in the United States. Today they tend to see them in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In any measure of where we go from here, we need to understand the realities of today, not just the aspirations of being able to close up barriers and live on the fat of the land and be happy forever after. That is not on. No longer can we look inwards. If we do not look outwards, our capability to survive as an independent nation, preserve our living standards and offer our children and our grandchildren the opportunities that we believe are ours, is going to be lower.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the first fundamental. One needs to look to that world around us. If you go a bit further, some figures this week identified the GDP of a number of the individual regions of Japan. Some of you might have seen them. It really hit me that the GDP of the largest region&mdash;that around Tokyo&mdash;is greater than that of China, South Korea and Australia combined. That is not Japan as a whole, that is one small area around Tokyo. Not only does that small area have a GDP as huge as that, but it is also a region where intellectual endeavour is significantly greater than many see in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While for years it was said that the Japanese were very good at imitating others' capabilities, today to say that of them would be to deny the incredible advances they have made in technology, in the silicon area, in computers, and generally in electronics. The whole capability of that one of the many regions of Asia is significantly greater than the GDPs of China, South Korea and Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are, in fact, three major areas that are significantly greater than China and Australia. If you take the first five, they are some of the most significant economies of the world. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5315"> Without going into the details of other countries with their population bases, the one thing that we really need to register is not just where they are geographically, but also the size of their relative growth. While many of us feel that Australia's economy is now coming out of the rough, in reality the opportunities in our region are such that most of those economies are growing at about twice the rate that Australia's economy is growing. So, while you can say that most of the Asian economies will be eight plus, Australia will have a parameter of four or thereabouts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is in that dimension that I think we have to look at Australia's budget and the adverse consequences of the rhetoric of the honourable member for Oxley and those who support her. Within the Australian economy there are quite real difficulties, and I want to talk a little bit about the economy because I think it is important. The first thing we need to remember is that we have been fortunate to be now coming out of, if not quite a recession, very nearly a recession. Certainly, in housing it looked to be a recession in most states. If you have a look at the rural economy, the fact that we have recovered from drought, rather than any other factor, has been the main reason for this significant lift in incomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It worries me, however, that behind those figures there is a lot of fundamental change. I want to come back to that because it is the fundamental change in where we are going that we need to be concerned about. The housing upswing is now under way, perhaps more in New South Wales and Victoria than in some of the other states. One of the worries I have about our savings policy is how fundamental housing has been to the whole economy. Every small business tends to revolve around housing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that for years the economists have said that we place too much emphasis on home ownership. I do not accept that and it worries me that we seem to no longer recognise how important it is for people to own their own home and how important that has been as a catalyst to economic growth and to the falling interest rates. This has been a significant part of the program this government has been able to facilitate that has enabled the housing sector to grow. Falling interest rates more than anything now are starting to see that housing economy revive and, to my mind, that is going to be the real catalyst to recovery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to business investment, if you look at the 1996&hyphen;97 business surveys, they suggest that business investment has risen 15.5 per cent nationally, and 15 per cent in New South Wales, with Olympic&hyphen;related projects there only one factor in that growth. In other words, we are starting to see a significant turnaround in housing and in business investment. As far as employment goes, there is no better catalyst to change than that reflects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I felt sad that the budget was not promoted more than it was. I know that it is very difficult with so many other major issues about to keep concentration on a budget. For most people a budget is just another financial set of figures and they do not understand the impact it has. I know that some have said&mdash;and certainly the opposition was suggesting&mdash;that the budget did not achieve a great deal. I thought that was one of its successes. For too long we have looked for spectacular change year by year in our budget. I am one of those who has argued for years that we ought to try and start budgeting for more than 12 months. I think that we are at a disadvantage in Australia because we have this mind&hyphen;set that every 12 months you are suddenly going to get a new set of numbers and move away from that. In that first budget we produced I would have liked to look at a three&hyphen;year program. People would have seen that it did not have to change fundamentally every year, but that we were really moving to a freely identifiable and declared objective.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5316">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, that is what this budget has done. It is not just a separate budget; it is part of the product of last year's budget and is moving in its fiscal outcomes towards the surplus next year from which we can operate. As we know we will move from an underlying deficit of $3.9 billion to a small surplus of $1.6 billion next year and a substantial surplus of $5.4 billion in 1999&hyphen;2000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To my mind, that is a significant when looking at the longer term. What we have got to do to get Australia stable and developing again is to stop year-on-year changes. Spectacular policies might be all very well but spectacular policy changes do not give the stability that economic growth and job generation require. There is a belief that because the fellow next door is doing something else that we should do something else and that therefore we will be better off. In fact, that does not work. In government as in business, even though you might not like all the financial and economic programs that are in place, it is better to have constancy. You can plan and you can get better outcomes as a result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other significant change under the coalition has been the level of asset sales. Over the period 1997&hyphen;98 to 1999&hyphen;2000 the level has been lifted to a net expected return of about $15.9 billion and that is going to mean substantial headline surpluses and negative funding requirements. That is going to ensure that government debt will contract by more than $20 billion, from 19 per cent of GDP, to around $84 billion or 13 per cent of GDP by June 2001.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The significance of that is that pressure on interest rates as the economy revives is going to be downwards. If we can keep interest rates down, above all else it is going to help those two sectors I identified before, business investment and housing. To my mind, more significantly than anything else, those are the two areas where you are going to get long and permanent job growth. That is why I regard this budget outcome as being significant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were, of course, two new initiatives&mdash;the private savings policy and the indexation of the pension to 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. The private savings policy I regard as a worthwhile step. My concern for a long while has been that there has been too much emphasis given to superannuation. I do not agree that superannuation is the only way by which people should be encouraged to save. We ought to have far more flexibility. Of course we have to generate savings, nobody can deny that, but we have to ensure that savings are not in any single sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mentioned housing before. I think housing is an important part of savings. But so too is reinvestment by small businesses in their enterprises. So too are savings that are deposited in banks. To highlight one of the bete noirs that many of us have had about industrial super, I still find it absolutely impossible to understand how those who have small sums deposited on their behalf into a superannuation account at the end of the year are charged for the administration of that money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I was a child, when we were all young, many of us had Commonwealth Savings Bank accounts. If you had a few dollars, in my days it was a few pounds, you were paid interest on the amount. Why can't those who have got use of your money pay you for the use of that money that they hold, albeit as superannuation. It has always seemed to me to be bizarre that that is not the case. I believe superannuation is not the only way that governments should encourage people to save and aggregate their money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I wanted to go beyond that to look at the general direction of where we are going. The important thing is to look not just inwards but also to look outwards. There is no doubt that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5317"> our export generated growth is going to be the most significant part of the changes I see about us. Changes brought by the World Trade Organisation are important. Breaking down those tariff barriers has been far more successful than it ever was. The initiative that Joe Dawkins, the former member for Fremantle and former Treasurer and Minister for Trade, introduced through the Cairns Group was probably one of the most successful initiatives in our recent trade history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was one of those who battled over the years to try to get the common agriculture policy of the European Community and the export enhancement programs of the Americans countered. The Cairns Group for the first time brought together a very effective and ongoing group that has been able to battle against some of the price setting policies of the more powerful and affluent Europeans and Americans. I commend Tim Fischer, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, for the efforts he has made because the Cairns Group has done an enormous amount to free up an area of our exports which is still very important. And as far as rural Australia is concerned, it continues to be important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the rural sector about which I want to express my principal concern. Commodity price volatility remains with us. We have had better access through the WTO, but we are still in a very difficult position. Wheat and sugar industries are in the process of tidying up their marketing arrangements. One would hope that, out of that, they are not going to destroy the very good market access that we have enjoyed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sugar now has to compete far more than it used to, and the industry's technology gives advantage to the developing world. It is not going to be as easy to sell sugar as it is at the moment, and sugar prices remain volatile. It should also be noted that, if we are in a good season, we produce 20 million tonnes of wheat: in a bad season, the United States produces more than 150 million tonnes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to recognise that we export a great deal of our product&mdash;wheat, sugar, beef, wool, and increasingly mutton and lamb, and many other agricultural goods and produce. Our difficulty is that we still have no capacity in the rural sector to set the prices&mdash;in other words, to budget accurately ahead. It worries me, because out of that we have a serious defect in many of the family farming business operations around this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that the policies the government is putting in place in investment, small business and certainly as far as the rural sector is concerned, are on the right track. I am still very worried about the rural sector and price volatility. That is going to be one of the challenges that this government and state governments need to address over the course of the next few years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The thing that worries me most is that, if we are going to protect the small business sector, it is intellectual property on which we have to rely. Years ago Bob Hawke talked about the clever country. For years CSIRO research in the rural sector was a very important part of our being able to maintain our competitive edge. I am concerned that at the moment we are not giving the priority to research that I believe is necessary if we are going to maintain that competitive edge in the rural sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Two things are important for the revival of the rural sector. It is not only volatile markets but what we do ourselves. It is not just production research, it is very much looking at the ongoing processing, the development of finished products, and the marketing of those goods. The big challenge for us in Australia is to make sure we look at the world around us, recognise where we are and, if we are going to be competitive in the future, spend more money on 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5318"> research, individually and collectively, as a nation. We must maintain the CSIRO and its range of achievements, and we certainly must look at the marketing of our product.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we can maintain research and we can maintain assistance for marketing and promotion, then I believe we can overcome those problems of small business in the rural sector. If we do not, then I suspect, no matter how good the budget, we are going to have ongoing difficulties in employment and in aggregating savings and, above all, in being competitive in the world. If we are not competitive, I am afraid that the sorts of policies that the honourable member for Oxley proposes are likely to leave us in a very much inferior position for the future.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise here this evening to support Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1997&hyphen;98, and to commend my government on a number of visionary and positive initiatives announced in our 1997&hyphen;98 budget. I note that there has been some criticism from some sectors claiming that the budget is somewhat bland and boring. May I suggest that handing down a budget that meets all commitments without having to borrow a single cent, thus resisting the normal tendency these days of accessing bankcards, could be more appropriately called living within our means as a nation. I would call that being responsible. If dull and boring is being responsible and restrained, then so be it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is even more exciting is the $1.6 billion surplus expected next year. We should really dwell on the significance of this achievement. In just three years since our election to government we will have gone from a $10.5 billion black hole deficit spiralling hopelessly out of control towards bankruptcy to an expected $1.6 billion surplus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the benefit of those on the other side, we will not only be starting to repay some of our massive foreign debt but we will be able to again start expanding services to those most needy in our community. If I may say so, Mr Deputy Speaker, this is quite an achievement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly one of the best indicators of the success of the budget is the decision by the Reserve Bank to drop a full 0.5 per cent off official interest rates 10 days after the budget was announced. That is the fourth drop in interest rates that we have had since coming to office, and the significance is reflected in the fact that at this point in time our interest rates are the lowest since the 1960s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This means that the family home buyers are now paying $276 a month less for their average mortgage. In other terms, this represents a pay rise of approximately $400 a month before tax&mdash;not a bad effort for just over a year, and I have no doubt that things will get better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the most visionary aspects of this budget is, in my opinion, the introduction of the tax relief on savings rebate. Mr Deputy Speaker, let me paint you a picture. In this country two children of the same sex can be born of the same womb on the same day. They can experience the same family environment, be offered identical education opportunities and on leaving school be offered identical jobs at the same rate of pay. During the course of their working lives one of these twins saves his hard&hyphen;earned wages; he may even take on a couple of extra part&hyphen;time jobs. In doing so, he will miss out on much of the joy associated in seeing the growth and development of his young family. He forgoes personal pleasures, struggles with mortgages and loans for the betterment of his family but all the time he puts away just that little bit of extra money so that he will not be a burden on his family or the wider community when he reaches retirement age.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other brother has a different view. He likes to live life to the fullest&mdash;I guess some people would call that selfish. He drinks and gambles away his wages, goes on endless 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5319"> holidays and accepts no responsibility for his family. He is a real good-time guy, one who enjoys and indulges himself throughout life, but on retirement he finds himself with hardly a penny.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are no prizes for guessing who the bureaucracy will fall over to help, and I can assure you it will not be the Mr Responsible. But at last things are starting to balance out and the Mr and Mrs Responsibles of Australia, and all of those independent retirees who will definitely be included in this category, are finally starting to be recognised. An amount of $450 in tax savings does not sound much but to independent retirees it is very significant. Its application to the broad savings spectrum, from shares and debentures to trust incomes and interest, will enable these worthy citizens the opportunity to maximise the benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I was saying earlier, moving into a surplus will give us an opportunity to expand on programs and this is one that I would be very keen to see developed further. It is a small start but certainly one in the right direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The $1 billion Federation Fund is another great initiative. For years now successive governments have shirked their responsibilities to continue to upgrade national infrastructure. We are changing that. I must say that I have already moved to establish a Federation Fund committee in my electorate to ensure that we have maximum opportunities for accessing our fair share of this fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been numerous other initiatives worthy of acknowledgment. The $18 million allocated for defence infrastructure in Leichhardt and a further $1.5 million for the Daintree buy&hyphen;back as part of our commitment to the environment are just two good examples.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Families living in remote areas will receive additional support through changes in Austudy. Children will be given greater opportunities for work through the modern apprenticeship scheme and the one&hyphen;stop apprenticeship shop which recently opened in Cairns. I will address these initiatives and many others separately on later occasions, but on this occasion, however, I would like to focus on several issues which are of special importance to me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have had a long interest in the area of aged care, disability and palliative care. In my electorate there is an enormous demand for these essential services. I am pleased that a number of reforms with respect to these important issues were announced in the recent budget. The national carer action plan, changes to the child disability allowance and further support for the aged and frail members of our community are welcome measures. I believe these measures will be particularly meaningful in rural and remote regions, which comprise a large proportion of my electorate. These measures alone will not resolve the acute shortage of beds in nursing homes and hostels, nor the lack of appropriate accommodation for people with disabilities. However, they are an indication of the government's recognition of the specific needs of people in the community and are a very significant step in the right direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, I will raise the issue of carers. I must commend the government for significant changes announced in the Budget with respect to carers. These changes are very positive and will make a vast difference to the many carers who are giving their love, commitment and time to caring for people with disabilities. The $16.60 increase in the domiciliary nursing care benefit&mdash;an increase of 28 per cent&mdash;will be of enormous benefit to many carers in my electorate. My only regret is that this measure will not come into effect until mid next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The DNCB is paid to carers looking after people who would normally be in nursing homes or hostels if they were not being looked after at home. Keeping potential nursing home and hostel residents in their own homes longer makes a great deal of sense to me. It means they 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5320"> are in a familiar environment where they feel comfortable and secure. It means less pressure on current facilities and a cost savings to government. Increasing the DNCB is therefore a very wise measure in my opinion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The carer payment of $347.80 a fortnight, which will soon be made available to carers of children under 16 with severe or profound disabilities, will also help many families in my electorate. The many parents who, up to this point in time, have not received recognition nor assistance from the government for caring for their children with severe disabilities will now not only have recognition but also assistance in real monetary terms. Parents, like carers, need assistance and support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Extending the carer payment to carers who are required to take care of an adult and that adult's child is also recognition of the fact that the work of many carers normally goes far beyond their call of duty. I note, however, that this positive measure will not come into effect until March 1999. This is almost two years from now and it means that there are many carers who will be missing out and that those who need immediate relief will not benefit. I feel this is quite regrettable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am particularly pleased with the increase in the number of days of leave that carers can now access&mdash;up from 42 days to 63 days&mdash;without having their payments reduced or terminated. Considering the stressful, distressing and frequently physically exhausting nature of their work, carers could do with more time off. This is necessary just for them to recuperate and energise so that they can continue their work as carers more effectively for a much longer time. Without the threat of penalties, carers can now concentrate more fully on their work. I would go so far as to say that carers are the most unrecognised heroes in our nation. They are totally selfless. Interestingly, it is their compassion, commitment and generosity which best qualify them for the position of carers. They are very special people who do great and wonderful work in the area of caring.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At this point I would like to bring to the attention of the House one such person in my electorate who lives up in Kuranda, just west of Cairns. His name is Norbert Wald. He has been a carer for well over 20 years and I believe deserves very special recognition for his work. For all those years he has cared for Mrs Elvira Berg and has also helped raise her two children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say that I was incredibly touched when I learned of Elvira's story. While still in her mid&hyphen;20s, her and her husband were involved in a car accident. The car was driven by a gentleman who, while under the influence of alcohol, missed a red light and drove straight into them. Elvira's husband was killed instantly. Elvira herself spent a night in hospital. Unfortunately, the doctors did not pick up a blood clot and nerve damage. Soon after, she lost all capacity to move, to talk, and has been bedridden for over 27 years. Fortunately for Elvira, Norbert was found as a carer in her time of greatest need. His background as a hospital foreman meant that he knew the exact needs of Elvira and was able to accommodate them. His commitment and faith in the person he cares for, his generosity and selflessness are certainly very commendable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Changes announced in the budget relating to the child disability allowance are, I believe, also a step forward. However, caution needs to be taken to ensure that unnecessary draconian assessment methods do not develop that would prevent families who rightly deserve assistance from being eligible for it. The notion of more reliable and simpler methods of assessing eligibility for the child disability allowance is, I believe, reasonable. I am pleased that the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5321"> inclusion of a list of manifest and chronic medical conditions has been made which will enable families to fast&hyphen;track access for the child disability allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe the measures introduced in the budget with respect to the child disability allowance are generally very positive. It is particularly pleasing to know that the government recognises the sensitivities involved in and the special needs of families who have a child or children with disabilities. I am sure that those families who are already receiving the child disability allowance and those who will be receiving it at the end of June 1998, will be relieved to know that they will continue to receive payments until 30 June 2003, without being subject to further medical reviews during this period. Few families will mind reverting to the new assessment system at the end of this period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that the new child disability allowance applicants who do not qualify for the benefit under the new table assessment system but who have a chronic medical condition will qualify for the health care card. This will assist in meeting the costs of medication and will benefit families in my electorate. I believe this measure could easily be adopted in other areas as well, particularly where it concerns people who are on low incomes, part&hyphen;time workers or self&hyphen;funded retirees on modest incomes who are not eligible for the health care card but who clearly need one. I urge the government to consider this seriously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that an allocation of over half a million dollars has been made to support the elderly members of our community who suffer from dementia. I am particularly pleased that $19,000 of this money will go towards the Cairns aged care assessment team. This assistance will enable the team to retain and further expand the psychogeriatric services currently provided in the Cairns area. The Cairns aged care assessment team plays a vital role in the recognition of signs of dementia and the assessment of respective needs. Although $19,000 is very much welcome, it is nowhere near enough to meet our current needs and more needs to be done in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Palliative care is an area which I also feel very strongly about. I cannot help but think of the issue of euthanasia when the pros and cons of palliative care are debated. Many of you I am sure would be aware that I voted against the Kevin Andrews private members bill which overturned voluntary euthanasia in the Northern Territory. I take this opportunity to remind the chamber that I voted against the bill not because I am pro&hyphen;euthanasia but because I am enormously concerned about the federal government's interference in state and territory internal affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was particularly concerned on this occasion as I was very much aware that approximately 85 per cent of Northern Territory residents voted for the euthanasia legislation in their territory. In light of this majority, I do not believe that our government had the right to overturn the people's will. I must say that, in overturning the Northern Territory euthanasia laws, the federal government must now look more closely at the issue of palliative care with the view of seriously addressing the current shortcomings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The allocation in the budget of $14.7 million for palliative care is a positive step in the right direction. However, I am convinced that this is nowhere near enough to meet current needs. I cannot help but feel that this allocation will only scratch the surface. I am also very firmly of the view that the Northern Territory legislation had nothing to do with a community hell&hyphen;bent on killing less fortunate citizens. It was more of a cry for help out of sheer desperation in seeing their citizens dying slowly and, in some cases, very painfully, due primarily to an 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5322"> almost total lack of palliative care funding. I personally believe that once appropriate palliative care is made available, the call for euthanasia as an option will greatly diminish.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In closing, let me say that this budget is one that is finally starting to remove the blinkers. It is one that shows that we have a government that is capable of lateral thinking and is not prepared to continue to offer bandaid solutions. It is a government that is looking to establish new and innovative ways of dealing with age&hyphen;old problems, and one that is finally starting to get its priorities right. It is going to go some way to identifying, supporting and rewarding the most needy in our society, as well as those who are, without doubt, the most worthy. I am confident that with continued successful financial management, we can continue to grow and further develop those essential programs. I commend this bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1997&hyphen;98, I must say that this government is to be congratulated on the second budget in our first term. I notice, as an aside, that the Labor Party has dropped out of this debate. By their absence, in dropping off the speakers list, they are doing one of two things: they are either endorsing without criticism this appropriation bill; or they are showing that they have lost interest. I think it is probably the second.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The debt inherited from the previous Labor Keating&hyphen;Beazley government has been significantly reduced. This budget has Australia paying off $5 billion worth of Beazley's bankcard debt, without having to raise taxes. That is in this current second budget. Not only has this government been able to reduce the debt in its second budget, but also the next budget will produce a surplus&mdash;the first surplus for a decade. We should be congratulated for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is getting us out of debt, and the people of Australia are benefiting from this. If anybody knew before the last federal election what debt was, it was the Australian people. The Labor Party, though, is trying to convince us that this budget contains many mindless and counterproductive cuts affecting the quality and decency of life in Australia. This is not what the people of Australia think.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people of Australia are experiencing low inflation and low interest rates. Again, as an aside, I remember the scuttlebutt saying that if Keating could have got interest rates down, he would have gone in November rather than March 1996. Families under Labor were struggling to pay their mortgages in the early 1990s because of high interest rates. They are now experiencing the benefits of this government's responsible financial management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 14 months, the coalition government has presided over a reduction of interest rates from 10.5 per cent to 6.99 per cent. An average family on a mortgage of $100,000 will now be at least $275 a month better off. That is better than any wage rise. This is a real achievement for the battlers of Australia&mdash;John Howard's battlers. I know that many families and individuals in Swan have mortgages around this amount and they will benefit from this. You can really convince people when you talk about their wallet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Dobell (Mr Lee) says that interest rates are down because unemployment is up and the economy is flat. If the member for Dobell had just hung on, he might have  remembered that in the late 1980s and early 1990s, under the Hawke and Keating governments, not only was unemployment high but interest rates were up around 18.5 per cent in some sectors. Debt was high and the economy was in a lot worse shape than it is in now. Small business interest rates were around 26 per cent in the late 1980s. That is what the Labor Party did for small business.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5323">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was a slowdown in the economy last year, but there is evidence of a pick-up in the economy now in the form of investment figures, lower interest rates and increased housing starts which will ultimately feed through to the labour market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are in a process of correcting the unemployment figures. It cannot happen overnight unless we are irresponsibly throwing money around like the previous government did. I believe that in the next year we will see the gradual improvement result in better employment figures as well as a managed economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor is trying to convince us that this budget continues an assault on families, the elderly and the needy. Under this budget, carers who stay at home to look after an elderly relative or child with a disability will receive a long overdue increase in domiciliary nursing care benefits and an extension of the carer's payment. Approximately one&hyphen;third of my electorate of Swan is aged and I know that this is going to assist many of my constituents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor is trying to convince us that this budget does nothing for jobs, the nation's most overwhelming current economic and social problem. One hundred thousand new apprentices will get a boost from the $265 million that has been set aside to create real jobs. There is $50 million to expand vocational education in high schools, $24 million for new national network apprenticeship shops and $20 million to help disadvantaged unemployed people gain an apprenticeship or traineeship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The $1 billion Federation Fund will create jobs next year when the projects commence to mark the federation of Australia. Australians will be involved in building projects of national significance to commemorate the federation of Australia, and so we should. This $1 billion is not a training scheme, it is a tangible project which will support construction, infrastructure projects and their associated industries as well as providing the spin&hyphen;off to employment. These are all measures directed towards reducing the level of unemployment and, in particular, youth unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite ironic that in my seat of Swan, before I was able to take over from the previous member, who was also the minister for unemployment as I like to call it, Kim Beazley&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PK6">Mr RANDALL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is well below the percentage that he had. It has been taken over by the older sector, actually. There is going to be $21.6 million for the work for the dole initiative which will, importantly, enable people to get back into the community. As anyone who has been long&hyphen;term unemployed can testify, they start to feel removed from the ordinary everyday association with their peers, et cetera, if they are long&hyphen;term unemployed. It is a well-known fact that once you are in the employment sector it is far easier to get a job with the networks that you create.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This work for the dole scheme will break the damaging cycle of unproductivity, isolation, low self&hyphen;esteem and health problems which many unemployed people experience. In my own electorate of Swan approximately 7,000 people currently receive the newstart allowance, the allowance paid to longer term unemployed people. These are some of the people that the work for the dole scheme will assist.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5324">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the Labor Party would rather be obstructive and complain about the government's initiatives and our attempts to put some hope into the lives of the long&hyphen;term unemployed than do something constructive. Their proposed amendments to the work for the dole bill only highlighted the ALP's inability to do anything without their union mates' say&hyphen;so, and that is because their union mates are running their agenda, and we know that. Just have a look: you have got Bob Hawke, former ACTU president; Simon Crean, former ACTU president; Martin Ferguson, former ACTU president; and Jenny George, who tried to get a job on the Senate ticket. It is a retirement village for former ACTU presidents. The Labor constituency should be quite cynical about their motives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ALP is concerned that the work for the dole scheme will introduce even more people into the work force who are unaccustomed to union interference; in other words, people who are self&hyphen;reliant and self&hyphen;motivated. The ALP knows that there will be safety nets in place for work for the dole. They know that work for the dole participants will not replace those in existing jobs. The ALP knows that there will be occupational health and safety regulations and other conditions to ensure the participants are properly treated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, a nice newsletter from Cables Downunder says that in Sydney during the 1920s and 1930s Depression, as a part of unemployment relief, councils applied for funding to underground all cables, as part of the work for the dole scheme, so it has been around for some time. Poor Kim Beazley! He is faltering in his leadership. He has Simon Crean looking over his shoulder, and the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans) would not mind being king in this House because he did not go too well in the other one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Beazley is trying to find something to remind him of the old days of Labor. He would like union interference in the work for the dole schemes, just as he supported union interference in the recent strikes in Western Australia. In fact, Kim Beazley is a disgrace when it comes to supporting Western Australia. He is anti Western Australia. He supported the previous blockade in 1993 or thereabouts, and he also supported the current union action in Western Australia. In fact, he was up at their so&hyphen;called workers' embassy, encouraging them to continue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The power shutdown alone cost the state of Western Australia $100 million&mdash;totally endorsed by Kim Beazley. In fact, unionists who were not providing services were saying, `This is not a strike; it is a protest.' What is the strike about? What is the reason for 25,000 people marching up St George's Terrace in Perth? What is the reason for the extraordinary scenes of abuse and aggression at Parliament House in west Perth, preventing members of parliament from entering the House to carry out their duty? It was an absolute disgrace to see the former President of the Upper House of Western Australia being barred from getting into his own House by a bunch of union thugs&mdash;quite reminiscent of what happened to this House last August when the world as we knew it was going to end because of the current budget and the current legislation. They smashed the front door down, dragged the female federal police into the crowd and kicked the living daylights out of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has this legislation done, other than improve the lot of unionists and workers in Australia? They do not want secret ballots. I go through a secret ballot when I get elected, and most of us go through a secret ballot. What does the Labor Party with their union mates have to fear from secret ballots?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No wonder the member for Brand is so frustrated! He has got the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) sitting in his dad's old seat&mdash;the safe Labor one that he really wanted. He tried to get it, but they would not let him have it. Somehow he has not got enough pull in Western 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5326"> Australia to get the seat of Fremantle. He would be up for some compensation, though, if he really did make a move towards Fremantle, because I believe Senator Chris Evans, Peter Dowding&mdash;the former state Premier&mdash;and another failed WA Inc. former Premier all want the seat of Fremantle. I say to the member for Brand, `You have got no hope of getting Fremantle, even if Carmen does not keep going there.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why put the member for Brand into the seat of Fremantle? How do you turn a safe Labor seat into a marginal one? You get Kim Beazley, the current member for Brand, to run for it; he will run it down to a very narrow margin.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I love it so much that I love flying over it. The budget continues the fiscal consolidation strategy which moves the budget from a deficit position to a $1.6 billion surplus. This is a budget for small business. The budget impacts on, and assists, those small business initiatives announced in the March budget last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A small business innovation fund of $120 million to the Commonwealth to commercialise technology ideas, capital gains tax exemption on retirement, and simplification of record keeping are all benefits for small business as well as a single entry point and common licences to help small businesses when they are dealing with governments. What will complement those initiatives even further is the opposition's acceptance of the workplace relations exemption regulations, which propose to exempt small businesses. We can expect continued obstruction from the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that you are trying to stop businesses with under 15 people from being exempt from the unfair dismissal provisions. I really hope that you continue to stop it, because I would love to go to a double dissolution on native title and the Wik decision, on the unfair dismissal provisions, and on work for the dole. I would increase my majority and I would be very happy to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that, as far as unfair dismissal goes, Labor originally supported this and recognised it as an incentive to employ younger people in particular. But this legislation is currently in the Senate where the ALP and the Democrats do not support anything unless there are millions of taxpayers' dollars attached to it. They want to throw money at it and, in this case, it is not going to happen. As I say, I hope it becomes a trigger.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not for a moment deny that there are some unscrupulous employers&mdash;I mentioned this in the House today&mdash;who would unfairly dismiss staff. But, realistically, employers have nothing to gain by going through the lengthy selection process, spending time and money training new staff, allowing them to develop into productive employees and then dismissing them and doing it all over again. In the youth unemployment area, quite often you will try several people before you find a successful one. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last week two of my young constituents told me they were taking the plunge and buying their first home. With home loan interest rates now below seven per cent, they decided it was too good an opportunity to miss. Just nine years ago, as a Brisbane city councillor, I had constituents crying over my desk that they could not pay their rates because under Labor their mortgage interest rate had rocketed to 17.5 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now, thanks to this budget and the 1996&hyphen;97 budget, interest rates are at their lowest level since 1972. To most this means a cut in mortgage payments of around $292 a month&mdash;far more than any union&hyphen;delivered wage increase. You do not have to have a degree in economics, or even a vague understanding of the finances of the nation, to recognise the impact on the community of these changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget continues the economic groundwork established by this government with its first budget. Above all, we are paying off the massive $10 billion&hyphen;plus debt left to Australians by the former Labor government. This budget also introduces a first for the people of  Australia: 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5328"> a savings rebate to encourage saving. A rebate of 15 per cent on up to $3,000 of savings, which includes personal superannuation contributions, will give people a motive and a profitable reason to save.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since this government was elected, we have seen a lowering of inflation. This is of benefit to all Australians, including independent retirees. When your income is limited or fixed, spiralling inflation means rising costs of goods and services while low inflation means more for your money. Anyone who does not understand this should try buying a cup of coffee in Tokyo, where you will not get change from $10, or take a trip to Zaire, where inflation is now running at 600 per cent. Four years ago, a traveller received three Zairean dollars for an Australian dollar. Today you get $162,000 Zairean dollars for one Australian dollar.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our cost of living is, in my opinion, still far too high. It is, again, a legacy of 13 years of Labor government. It is now obvious to even the most inexperienced punter that this budget is leading us well on the way to financial recovery and therefore to social recovery. Social recovery will also come with a change in attitude. After more than a decade of untargeted immigration, handouts to any group who knew how to make enough media noise and a second generation of people with no expectations of jobs, urgent and dramatic changes had to be made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, let us look at the emotive issue of immigration. Despite the claims that we are being discriminatory by making changes to the concessional family category, the feedback I am getting from my electorate of Griffith has indicated strong approval for this move. Our new course in family reunions is one which most other countries have always adopted, with a focus on immigrants who have skills. As much as we would like to be a country of plenty, the taxpayers of Australia are hurting and simply cannot afford to sponsor migrants who have to be supported for several years after their arrival.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is just as important for the families of immigrants that those who come to join them and live in our country also have jobs. When we came into office we inherited a migration program dominated by the family stream which represented almost 70 per cent of the program. The previous government had simply opened the gates. Little or no serious consideration had been given to the impact of entry of persons with low skill levels and little or no ability to speak English.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A respected member of my Chinese business community expressed her concern at the number of Chinese who had trouble finding work and assimilating due to their inability to speak, read or write English. She also told me that she knew of immigrants who chose Australia simply because, as she said, `It was the easiest country to get into'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is restoring balance and integrity to our immigration program. Our goal is to make life as easy as possible for those who make Australia their new home. Our measures are consistent with taking responsibility for not only the future of those immigrants who have settled here, but also the new arrivals. If this is being discriminatory, as the opposition so loudly proclaims, then I suggest that their concerns are more for votes than the wellbeing of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our priority lies with the reunion of migrants entering as the spouses or children of Australians. Parents, brothers, sisters, aunts and uncles can apply on their own merits and if they qualify, will be welcomed. By introducing a two&hyphen;year waiting period for social security benefits for migrants, we have redirected a substantial amount of welfare dollars into the community.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5329">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It must be noted that this government has a commitment to skilled and business migrants who, we all know, benefit the economy and create jobs for Australians. Those of my constituents who look closely at this government's employment program will see that we are not focussing on shuffling funds by moving people off the dole onto the endless and often pointless training schemes. This was the cycle for the unemployed as established by the Keating government: off the dole to reduce the figures; onto a training scheme with a marginal chance of a job at the end, and then back on the dole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A young man who came to my electorate office to have his CV photocopied had done six courses during the year, including a six weeks course in panel beating. I ask this House: who would allow a person with just six weeks training to start knocking dents out of their car? I am not alone when I say that I get many calls from constituents complaining that they have a job available but cannot find anyone with enough basic skills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A local builder told me two weeks ago that he had more work than he could handle and desperately needed to hire another three carpenters. He said any good carpenter was as busy as he was. He was now having to knock back work because he could not find anyone experienced enough to hire.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This brings us to the $265 million in this budget set aside for more than 100,000 new apprenticeships and traineeships for the next year. Employers cannot afford to train young people without assistance. This bill introduces a $1,500 completion payment for employers whose apprentice or trainee achieves Australian qualification framework level 3 competency. In other words, we are training young people in jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there is the work for the dole pilot scheme, with funding of $21 million. This is not a shuffle off the dole scheme; this is giving people on the dole the most important thing they can achieve&mdash;that is, a work ethic&mdash;while placing them with a team to work at a real job, one that is of value to the community and therefore of value to the participant.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not need to remind anyone of the demoralising effect of being unemployed. This can lead to the belief that you are unemployable. We can and will turn this around with our school to work strategy which has already been piloted in Queensland with great success.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also have introduced our Green Corps program, which creates training for people in one of the most important areas&mdash;the environment. People joining the Green Corps are working alongside environmental specialists and learning skills that are vital not only to the future of this planet and our nation but vital to the immediate community in which they live.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind the House of the $1.25 billion in this budget to fund the Natural Heritage Trust over six years. The government was opposed tooth and nail by the opposition and minor parties in establishing this fund&mdash;the largest restoration program for our environment. Besides its vital importance to restoring our rivers, vegetation and land, this massive injection of funds will create employment. This bill makes it clear that this government is establishing the environment for jobs and training for young people from the moment they leave school, not after they have spent years losing confidence as they queue for the dole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition and many politically motivated groups in the community are demanding faster action in creating jobs. This government will not create illusory jobs. This government is establishing a sound foundation for industry to create jobs&mdash;real jobs with lasting benefits. If the previous government looks at its own track record in my electorate of Griffith, there is a major area where jobs could have been created but this has been ignored.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5330">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I take you back to when the federal government, in consultation with the state and local government in Brisbane, set about upgrading Brisbane Airport and the Brisbane port. The port, at great expense, was moved to the mouth of the river at Fisherman's Island. The federal government committed funds to these two major projects, as well as funding for a national gauge rail line running from Acacia Ridge to the port. This was completed in November 1994. This grand plan was known as the gateway strategic plan, an initiative by the then Liberal Lord Mayor of Brisbane, Sallyanne Atkinson. This was a plan for industry along the Brisbane River from Colmslie to Moreton Bay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The region along the northern corner of my electorate is well&hyphen;positioned to take advantage of this strategy and we looked to receive major investment from the commercial and industry sectors. Industry would create not only construction jobs but long&hyphen;term employment. After exhaustive public consultation a regional strategic plan known as SEQ 2001 was evolved, which included the gateway strategic plan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I point out all of this because it shows just how much work and planning went into creating the infrastructure to encourage industry in the suburbs of Colmslie, Cannon Hill, Murarrie and Gibson Island, all of which are in my electorate. This strategic plan has gone into stagnation. I look at the rail line, the port, the airport and the arterial road, and ask the same question as my constituents: what happened to the promised jobs? I can tell them what happened at least to the last 200 which were promised by BHP. Last year the Brisbane City Council refused approval for BHP to establish a $160 million steel plant right in the heart of the area earmarked for such industry. I investigated the project. It fulfilled all criteria. It was knocked back purely for political expediency&mdash;and with it went 200 construction jobs and over 70 permanent jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With signals like that from Labor's Brisbane City Council, it is no wonder industries pack up and leave Australia, taking their jobs with them. This government has shown, with its first and now with its second budget, that we pay our bills before we throw taxpayers' money around for political gain. The changes created by this budget are establishing a sound foundation for Australia to redirect its focus on work opportunities, to retrain young school leavers and to pave the way for employers to hire apprentices. This training is for jobs which exist. We are creating an environment for savings as this budget establishes for the first time a savings plan for all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very easy to swing a cudgel to make holes in the budget strategy as laid down by this government, but the facts and figures are there. This government has stopped the endless flow of dollars from the pockets of Australians. By the end of this next term, John Howard will have put this country back in the black. But it is more than dollars in the bank&mdash;this government has a social policy to match. We are changing the attitudes of two generations brought up to believe that the government was an employer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have set in motion aged care reforms to tackle the urgent, if not critical, need for reform in the nursing home sector. The opposition can rant and rave about the introduction of accommodation bonds, but they cannot alter the fact that the nursing home sector is in crisis. The Labor Party cannot deny that our senior citizens, who are in need of special care, have been ignored. The Labor Party cannot deny that our nursing homes are having trouble keeping afloat and that many are unable to provide adequate care and facilities for their residents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party argues that we are not putting enough money into the nursing home sector. Funny about that; it had been busy taking it out. The Keating government reduced capital 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5331"> funding to nursing homes from $200 million in 1989&hyphen;90 to just over $10 million in its last year. We have not only introduced accommodation bonds as a capital funding program for nursing homes, but also increased the government subsidy for dementia care by 30 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have redirected funding for child&hyphen;care assistance to increase the number of low&hyphen;income families able to qualify for assistance from 19,000 to 51,000. There has been relative silence from the opposition on this budget reform, but I am not surprised. Under the previous government, non&hyphen;working parents were receiving 50 hours of taxpayer funded child care per week. This has been reduced to 20 hours. We have acknowledged that non&hyphen;working parents who are studying or looking for work do need child&hyphen;care assistance, maybe for up to 50 hours a week, and we have also increased assistance for those using outside school hours care. This is a government which has produced a budget for economic and social growth, and I support this bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It gives me great pleasure to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1997-98, the 1997&hyphen;98 budget, together with the estimates for the coming years. I would like to congratulate the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) for putting together a document that not only meets the requirements of our nation today but, more importantly, meets the requirements of our nation in the period leading up to the next millennium.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget is clearly focused on improving Australia's savings record. It is clearly focused on providing a stable economy in which business can grow and in which business can develop. Up until now there has been a growing tendency in government budgets to focus on issues that seem to please the electorate as opposed to budgets that focus on issues that are good for the electorate. There is a fundamental difference, of course. It is easy to envisage the Treasurer coming down the flagpole of Parliament House every budget with a bag full of goodies like Santa Claus and delivering a lot of goodies to people in the electorates and to businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will remind the House that North Sydney, in my electorate, is the third largest business district in Australia. I discussed the budget with some of the 36,000 small businesses in my electorate, which is a very large figure, and with many of my 125,000 constituents. I encountered a disappointing response in all those discussions and that was, `What's in it for me? What do I get out of the budget?'. I have called it the Santa Claus phenomenon. Santa Claus comes twice each year to the Australian people&mdash;once on 25 December and again when the federal budget is announced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to change that attitude. It is a very difficult change to incorporate into the Australian ethos. It is very difficult. It is difficult when you have the New South Wales Carr government promising to give the parents of every school kid a cheque for $50 at the beginning of the school year just because the kid turns up to school. It does not matter whether they go to Newington or whether they go to Mount Druitt High, they get a cheque for $50. It is classic middle class welfare.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even worse, the Keating government introduced the pregnancy benefit, if you like. Every woman who had a baby was to receive a cheque in the mail for $200, and that was meant to ease the pain. It was not means tested so, in effect, it was a new form of middle class welfare. My response to that is that we cannot have middle class welfare at a time when we are trying to change the attitude in Australia so that people must rely on themselves for their future and save for their future.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5332">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Too few Australians would be aware that every week 7.5 million Australians expect a Department of Social Security cheque. That includes age pensioners who are, of course, in many cases, deserving of their age pension. That is 1.673 million people. In addition to that there is family tax payment; farm household allowance; mature age allowance; mature age partner allowance; Newstart allowance; Newstart mature age allowance; parenting allowance; partner allowance; rehabilitation pension; sickness allowance; sole parent pension; special benefit; widow allowance; widow's pension; wife pension; youth training allowance; bereavement allowance; carer pension; child disability allowance; disability support pension; disability wage supplement; disadvantaged persons scheme; double orphan pension, and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When is it going to stop? When will people stop expecting that they are going to get some form of benefit? There are 7.5 million Australians who expect a Department of Social Security cheque. Not for one second would I deny those who need help a helping hand, not for one minute, not for a second, because if people deserve then they deserve it. But 7.5 million Australians are not deserving of Department of Social Security support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are 7.2 million Australians that are paying taxation and of the total budget of $133 billion, $53.4 billion is spent on welfare. Over 40 per cent of the budget is spent on welfare&mdash;health, $20.7 billion; education, $11 billion; defence, $10.4 billion; economic services, and that incorporates repayment of our national debt, $8.3 billion; general services covering administrative services and a range of functions in support of the other areas, $6 billion; and of course payments to the states, $17 billion. That payment to the states is supplemented by the states' own taxation system, which roughly accounts for $33 billion around Australia.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So the total tax take around Australia is around $150 billion, of which one&hyphen;third goes in welfare to 7.5 million Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose what I am trying to say to the people in my electorate is that we should support the people that need a helping hand. That is, part of the most basic Liberal phenomena and theme in the 1990s has to be to support people that deserve a helping hand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my electorate, there are people that can afford and are prepared to pay their way in the 1990s and in the years beyond. It is those sort of people that are starting to come to terms with the fact that we cannot expect to get middle class welfare. We cannot expect to get a whole range of schemes that are going to prop up business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have got a simple message, particularly for big business and it is this. As soon as you start to develop a welfare mentality, we can almost give up the game, because you are meant to be the proponents of self sufficiency, you are meant to pride yourselves on making a buck, earning that buck, producing a buck and then making a profit out of it. If you start to cry out for business welfare then you are letting the side down and you are making yourselves not only nationally uncompetitive but more importantly internationally uncompetitive. It is that part of business welfare when you see significant business interest groups in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> or in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> saying, `What is in the budget for me? What did I get out of it'?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will tell you what you got out of it. You got something out of it that you never got in the late 1980s or in the early 1990s under the Labor party. You are getting a long&hyphen;term stable economy. And what does that mean? That means low inflation, that means low interest rates and lower interest rates and it also means most importantly that you have got an economy that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5333"> is starting to grow and to improve its exportation particularly to the biggest consumer markets and the fastest growing consumer markets in Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In short, what does that mean for business? Businesses went through a very volatile period under the Labor Party in the late 1980s and early 1990s. They were sold a pup during the 1980s that a boom would continue forever. The Labor Party sold it. You saw Bob Hawke and Paul Keating arm in arm with the Alan Bonds and the Christopher Skases and the Russell Gowards and all the various players that were out there&mdash;the entrepreneurial godfathers of the Australian economy, arm in arm. And what happened? Those people that they were shaking hands with and being photographed with in their black tie suits went to the wall quite dramatically. We are still feeling the effects of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most serious effect of that was not the October 1987 crash. The most serious effect was not the movement of money out of equities into real estate. The most significant effect was that it blew the confidence of small business in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We came into the 1990s following the credit squeeze instituted by Paul Keating when he was treasurer. We came into an environment with fairly high inflation, but the government was trying to rescue the economy and failing miserably with the net result that again small business seemed to suffer the brunt through high interest rates, uncompetitive inflation levels and significantly falling consumer confidence.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is the most revealing table in the entire budget because it gives a total breakdown of the underlying balance of the Commonwealth from 1960&hyphen;61 to 2000&hyphen;2001. And lo and behold, this extremely revealing document seems also to indicate the ebb and flow of the political fluctuations in Australia. What we saw throughout the 1960s was an underlying balance of a surplus between one and nearly four per cent of GDP.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the mid&hyphen;1970s, the underlying balance suddenly went into a deficit. Suddenly, we were running deficits of around minus two per cent of GDP and, of course, that was the effect of the Whitlam expenditure years when, basically, underlying outlays jumped around five per cent of GDP and he increased expenditure by 25 per cent in three years. And we start to wonder why we still have not recovered from the Whitlam years. Of course, revenue did not follow it and Australia went into significant deficit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the early 1980s, we managed to recover. We started to have a couple of surpluses but with the recession in the mid&hyphen;1980s, we went back into a deficit and, of course, as revenue was booming in the late 1980s we went into a surplus again. That was primarily linked to the massive creation of false capital in the Australian economy and, of course, in the late 1980s and early 1990s Australia once again went into a deficit as a part of GDP and we have not actually recovered. In fact, this year the deficit will be around minus 1.3 per cent and in 1997&hyphen;98, it will be 0.7 per cent. It will not be until 1998&hyphen;99 that we will actually achieve a balance for the first time since 1990.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does this mean for business? Over the next few years we are going to try and create a stable environment for you to do business. There is no doubt that interest rates have to come down further. When small businesses are paying 9.5 per cent and we have an inflation rate of 1.5 per cent, you start to really recognise why they are not making the super profits that everyone expected. You start to really recognise why they are not employing more people because within our taxation system there are significant disincentives for people to employ other people because of payroll tax, the superannuation guarantee levy, and a whole range of other factors that make the oncosts of employing someone far too great for a business to cope with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So how do you get business to employ more people? How do you get business to start to generate its own expansion? It is simple: you start to make businesses profitable, and that is a partnership between the economy and the businessmen or the businesswomen themselves. In the first place, this budget focuses on the economy. It is saying that we want to give you the right indicators and the right environment so that you can start to take a calculated risk to expand your business. You are not going to have rapid increases in interest rates. We are going to start to give you lower interest rates for the longer term. The best indication of how successful we have been in this is the significant narrowing of the gap between the 10&hyphen;year bonds of the US and the Australian 10&hyphen;year bond benchmark to just under 60 basis points. That is the narrowest difference between the US 10&hyphen;year bond and the Australian 10&hyphen;year bond for many years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does that mean? It means that international investors are starting to gain confidence in Australia. When they start to price our 10&hyphen;year bonds at the same level, or close to the same level, as the US 10&hyphen;year bonds, they are saying, `Listen, Australia is actually a stable and growing economy to invest in and we have confidence in Australia.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does that mean? The Governor of the Reserve Bank expressed it perfectly when he appeared before the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration. He said that there is growing confidence in the Australian economy and that at no time in Australia's history have home loans been more affordable or more accessible to the Australian people. That was a very significant comment. More importantly than that, the Governor of the Reserve Bank said that we have to get increased competition into small business lending.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of the day, banks are there to make a profit for their shareholders. We must recognise that. The banks' profit comes about through their making one loan, managed by three people, of $500 million to a major corporate customer, rather than making a multitude of small loans to small businesses&mdash;500 loans at $1 million each or 1,000 loans at $500,000 each&mdash;because the resources going into the cost of managing the loans and the possibility of business failure is far more significant with small business than it is with big business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, the banks will lend to a big business every day because it is easier and cheaper to manage than it is to lend to a small business. How do we create competition in that environment? Banks have to play their part, but we also need to look to other means. One of the Wallis inquiry recommendations&mdash;which I will not go into today&mdash;was that we should be looking at trying to improve competition in the banking sector in the provision of lending, particularly to small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is little doubt that through this budget we are providing the stable economy that Australians have been yearning for. We are concerned&mdash;and we should be concerned&mdash;about 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5336"> wage growth. We should be concerned that there is not an outbreak of wage demands, that people are not going beyond the pale in terms of negotiating increases in salary over the next two to three years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very concerned about recent claims that Commonwealth Bank employees are looking to increase their remuneration by around seven per cent per annum. If that happens, rest assured that Australian businesses will suffer the pain. Even if it is offset by productivity improvements, the people who are going to suffer are the businesses that cannot make the profit to pay the salaries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is only one way, in a low inflation environment, that they can meet the expectations of, essentially, their shareholders, and that is to start improving productivity to perhaps unreasonable levels. You can only do that by improving your equipment, looking for new markets and working out better industrial relations, or simply by retrenching people and getting people to work longer hours. Maybe that is one of the reasons why we had a very disappointing jobs outcome in the last month. Australian business needs to stop focusing on reducing its employment levels. It needs to focus on how it can become more profitable and, therefore, employ more people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the bill to the House. It is a landmark bill. It puts in train the budget until the next millennium. It puts in train the basis upon which we are going to build a stable economy for Australian business. More importantly, we are building an environment in which the Australian people can continue to have confidence that we as a government are acting on behalf of all Australians, particularly Howard's battlers. They are the big beneficiaries of this budget through the various announcements that have come to pass. I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later date.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) I am provided with updates on new technologies in the field of aircraft landing systems by Airservices Australia when there may be a beneficial impact on the management of aircraft take&hyphen;offs and landings at Australia airports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Airservices Australia has advised me that it had no specific knowledge of the Compressed Heuristic Universal Reaction Planners (CHURPs) being developed by Dr D Stirling and a literature search has provided little information on the project.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) Airservices Australia has advised me of: (a) the benefits of the Microwave Landing System (MLS) as a standard precision approach, landing and departure guidance system capable of supporting aircraft take&hyphen;off and landing in conditions of low visibility. Standards for MLS are published by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) MLS has been developed and manufactured in Australia. Currently an MLS is installed and is available to be used at Canberra Airport.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia is following a strategy established by ICAO at a world meeting in 1995. This strategy provides for the retention of the ILS, the installation of MLS when and as required and the evaluation of Differential Global Navigation Satellite System (DGNSS), sometimes called Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS), for approach and landing applications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A changeover from ILS to MLS is not seen as necessary in Australia and no further MLS installations are planned for Australian airports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) Airservices has advised the Minister that: (a) Current expectations suggest that the DGNSS system will provide greater flexibility in operation and lower cost compared with the existing ILS system.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs has 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5342"> provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Yes. The 1996/97 Budget delivered the most significant reorganisation of labour market assistance arrangements since the establishment of the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) fifty years ago. The new arrangements are designed to improve both the efficiency and effectiveness of employment assistance for job seekers who will have access to a service that is more convenient, accessible and tailored to their individual needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">By March 1998 there will be: an integrated, `one&hyphen;stop&hyphen;shop', Commonwealth Service Delivery Agency (CSDA) providing income support, basic employment and student assistance services to traditional CES and Department of Social Security (DSS) clients; and a new employment placement market in which employment placement enterprises (EPEs) and a corporatised Public Employment Placement Enterprise (PEPE) will operate in a contestable market to provide employment assistance services to job seekers, particularly disadvantaged job seekers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The new CSDA will provide support services to all job seekers. The new Agency with over 300 sites across Australia built on the existing DSS Office network, will continue to provide high quality information services to all job seekers. Staff from current DEETYA Student Assistance Centres, Youth Access Centres and around 2000 other CES staff will transfer to the Agency throughout 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The CSDA will be located in the former DSS Caulfield and St Kilda sites. The CSDA will provide a single shopfront where young people will be able to go for assistance including services provided by Youth Access Centres. The new arrangements will enable servicing of young people to be approached with a clearer emphasis on education and training assistance. Early intervention and the provision of information on available options and careers will also be an important part of these arrangements. The rationale for this focus is that without appropriate skills or education levels, young people will have difficulty in getting out of the unemployment cycle and are less likely to gain long term employment. The St Kilda Youth Access Centre will be relocated with integrated youth services at the CSDA in St Kilda.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new PEPE will compete alongside private and community providers in the new employment placement market to provide intensive support services to disadvantaged job seekers, job brokerage services to job ready clients, job search assistance to job seekers and other support services to employers of apprentices/trainees and job seekers seeking self employment opportunities. The size, organisational and locational arrangements for the PEPE will depend on its market share, and in particular the extent, mix and spread of the business it is contracted to provide. Its role as provider of last resort or provider of community service obligations will also impact on its locations/sites. Once the market shares are decided by DEETYA, following the tender round in the period June&hyphen; 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">December 1997, PEPE management will decide the numbers and locations of staff required by the PEPE to effectively deliver its services. In determining its likely sites, the PEPE will draw on the existing CES offices, including the two offices mentioned, namely St Kilda and Caulfield.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Yes. Persons unlawfully in Australia are usually restricted from making an application for residence while they remain in Australia. My announcement on 30 May 1996 was intended as a concession to allow certain unlawful non&hyphen;citizens to apply for residence, while remaining in Australia. It applies where the applicant has a spouse relationship with an Australian citizen or permanent resident and can demonstrate compelling circumstances of the nature described in my media release, which may prevent departure from Australia to apply overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The definition of "long term relationship" relates to waiver provisions within the two&hyphen;stage processing of applications for permanent residence on the basis of a spouse relationship or an interdependent relationship with an Australian partner. Applicants for these visas are either persons offshore seeking to migrate or holders of a substantive visa onshore.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) No. The definition of "long term relationship" included in the November 1996 regulations amendment does not apply to persons unlawfully in Australia who have applied for a visa following the media release of 30 May 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The definition relates to waiver provisions within the two&hyphen;stage processing of spouse and interdependent applications. New processing requirements offshore were introduced in November 1996 which entail two stages. The new procedures require a combined application for a temporary visa and a permanent visa be lodged at the same time and same place. The first stage of processing allows for the grant of a temporary visa to successful applicants, and the second stage, which normally occurs two years after the combined application was made, allows for the grant of a permanent visa to the applicant. The decision maker may waive the requirement that two years must have passed since the combined application was made before deciding the permanent visa application, if, at the time the combined application was made, the applicant was in a "long term relationship" with their Australian partner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new processing requirements offshore mirror existing procedures for onshore applications. The definition of "long term relationship" therefore also applies in onshore applications lodged by persons who hold a substantive visa at the time of application for a spouse or interdependent visa.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8E4">Dr Wooldridge</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) There are a number of difficulties in attempting to estimate the number of opiate dependent people on a national let alone a jurisdictional and age group basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Heroin use is illegal and hence users often prefer that others not know about their drug use. There is no universally accepted definition of "regular" or "dependent" heroin use and there are no well tested and unbiased methods available to produce a credible estimate of the number of people who make up such "hidden populations".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The number of people who are registered to receive methadone maintenance treatment in each State and Territory is known and occasional surveys of treatment agencies provide information on the proportion of clients seeking treatment who are opiate users. However, there is currently no reliable way of monitoring the number of opiate dependent people there are in addition to the groups who are in contact with treatment agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Drug Strategy Household Survey collects data on lifetime and recent (in the past 12 months) use of heroin. In the 1995 Household Survey the proportion of respondents reporting recent use of heroin was 0.4 per cent. Because of the very small numbers involved, any sub&hyphen;analysis of these responses or extrapolation of the results to the general community is of limited value. Furthermore, population surveys are not well suited to estimating the number of heroin users in the community. Household surveys are likely to under&hyphen;sample heroin users whose lifestyle makes them less likely to live in conventional living arrangements and less likely to participate in household surveys either because of their unavailability at the time the interviewer calls or their reluctance to agree to be interviewed. Heroin use is also likely to be under&hyphen;reported because it is illegal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of the 1995 Review of Methadone Treatment in Australia, the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre (University of New South Wales) used multiple methods (all with a degree of imperfection) to produce a range of estimates of the number of heroin users in Australia. While there were considerable uncertainties in these estimates, the work suggested that in 1990 there were approximately 59,000 regular heroin users. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">My department is currently working with the Illicit Drugs Expert Working Group (a subcommittee of the National Drug Strategy Committee) in developing a program of research relating to opiate use, one component of which is expected to be the establishment of baseline data on the number of heroin users in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) There are also difficulties associated with monitoring the number of deaths caused by illicit drugs. The Australian Bureau of Statistics routinely collects data on all deaths in Australia. This data is provided by the Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages in each State and Territory and is based on the information provided on death certificates, coded according to the International Classification of Diseases. The codes relevant to deaths caused by illicit drugs are largely those which identify drug dependence and accidental poisoning. This coding system results in some limitations. For example, while deaths due to opiates can be distinguished from those due to amphetamines it is not possible to distinguish deaths related to heroin use from those related to methadone or other opiates. The accuracy of the data is also highly dependent on the accuracy of the information entered on the death certificate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because of the limitations of the mortality data, I am not in a position to provide information on the current death rate due to illicit drugs. However, the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre is currently undertaking work on behalf of my department which will analyse available information on opiate&hyphen;related deaths on a jurisdictional and age group basis. This work is expected to be completed by July 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) (a) It would of course be feasible to express funding under the National Drug Strategy in per capita terms, however such calculations are somewhat meaningless because the National Drug Strategy does not represent the total response to the problems of drug and alcohol misuse, nor does it represent the Commonwealth Government's total contribution. The National Drug Strategy did not replace the existing prevention, treatment and law enforcement programming to deal with drug problems. Large amounts of funds outside of the National Drug Strategy continue to be spent on the treatment of disease and trauma caused by the misuse of drugs, and for law enforcement efforts to restrict the supply of drugs. These expenditures&mdash; which amount to much more than the total National Drug Strategy funding&mdash;continue to be spent by governments. For example, private sector methadone maintenance treatment has been largely covered by Medicare Benefits Schedule funding while public hospital drug and alcohol services receive funding through the Medicare Agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Simple comparisons of drug strategy expenditure on a per capita basis made between Australia and the USA are unlikely to have any validity given the significant differences in health, social and economic infrastructure in our two countries. Nonetheless, I have asked my Department to investigate the levels of expenditure on 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5349"> drug issues in a number of different countries which are comparable with Australia and to advise me on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) I consider that it would be wasteful of resources and unnecessary to convene a national drug summit at this point in time, for two reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Firstly, an independent evaluation of the National Drug Strategy has just been completed. The evaluation addressed the advisory and wider consultative mechanisms in place through the National Drug Strategy. The evaluation team, led by Professor Eric Single of the Department of Preventive Medicine and Biostatistics in the University of Toronto and Professor Tim Rohl of the Australian Graduate School of Police Management in Charles Sturt University, received written submissions and held discussions with expert researchers, service providers, community groups and consumer organisations. The report of the evaluation will be discussed by the Australasian Police Ministers' Council and the Australian Health Ministers' Conference at their respective meetings in July 1997. These meetings are expected to look at the future directions of the National Drug Strategy and particularly the incorporation of broader consultative mechanisms as recommended by the evaluators. If such a broad consultative approach can be achieved, a national drug summit will not be necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, the "heroin problem" is complex and could not be resolved by a single summit. We need to develop and maintain a multi&hyphen;faceted, national, strategic approach, such as that being pursued through the Illicit Drugs Expert Working Group (a subcommittee of the National Drug Strategy Committee), in conjunction with ongoing public debate and consultation. This underlines the importance of a broad consultative mechanism within the framework of the National Drug Strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) (a) On 2 April 1985, the Prime Minister, each State Premier and the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory met in the House of Representatives chamber in Parliament House, Canberra. That meeting was the Special Premier's Conference on Drugs, later known as The Drugs Summit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) The 1985 Drug Summit established the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse (NCADA), which subsequently became the National Drug Strategy. At that Special Premier's Conference, all States and Territories, and the Commonwealth committed themselves to conducting a continuing, co&hyphen;operative effort attacking drug abuse at all levels of Australian society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) The Summit established the broad directions of the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse. In particular, it was decided that the Campaign would place emphasis on reducing the demand for drugs through education, treatment and rehabilitation programs, while also including efforts to maintain and enhance restrictions on the supply of illegal drugs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) (a) The first national study of HIV prevalence in injecting drug users carried out during 1989&hyphen;90 in Perth, Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney reported a prevalence 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of approximately 7 per cent in Sydney and approximately 2 per cent in the other cities. Similar results were obtained when the survey was repeated in 1994, and in national surveys of HIV prevalence among people attending needle exchange programs in 1995 and 1996. The HIV prevalence overall was 2 per cent in 1995 and 1.7 per cent in 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) In 1996 clients attending needle exchange programs were tested for hepatitis C (HCV) antibody. The overall prevalence of HCV was 66 per cent. There was a small non&hyphen;significant increase in HCV prevalence in 1996 compared to a similar survey in 1995 when a prevalence of 63 per cent was recorded. The highest seroprevalence rate was recorded in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory (81 per cent) and the lowest rate in Queensland (46 per cent). Clients who had been injecting for more than three years and who were over 35 years of age were more likely to be HCV positive.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8T4">Mr Laurie Ferguson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 26 May 1997:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Is he able to say how many AusAID dam project personnel in Indo&hyphen;China have had a work history outside of dam construction activity or its ancillary engineering aspects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) What measures have been taken to ensure a reasonable level of scrutiny of the social impacts of the projects on the local population.</PARA></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="5352" SPEAKER="Downer, Alexander, MP" NAMEID="4G4" ELECTORATE="Mayo" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Foreign Affairs" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4G4">Mr Downer</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The Australian Government aid agency, AusAID, has no dam projects or dam project personnel in Indo&hyphen;China.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The only support that may be loosely interpreted in this way is our support to the Laos Hydropower Project Office through the United Nations Development Program (UNDP).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Lao Government has identified hydropower as its primary resource to provide revenue to develop the country. The Laos Hydropower Project Office (HPO) has the responsibility of assessing commercial proposals to develop hydropower in Laos. The HPO lacks education, skills and experience to properly assess the hydropower proposals to ensure that the people of Laos receive a fair return from the utilisation of a major resource, and that all environmental, social, legal and technical concerns are met.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The UNDP approached AusAID and sought Australian participation in an assistance program aimed at upgrading the skills levels of HPO personnel and at establishing a system that will allow hydropower proposals to be properly assessed. AusAID is not the only donor assisting the HPO in this program. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5353"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since August 1995 AusAID has been funding, through UNDP, a full time "Power Development Adviser" and a number of short term Advisers. All of these advisers have had relevant work history within the hydropower industry. This is to be expected given the nature of the tasks required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Long Term adviser assists the HPO to plan and manage the appropriate development of hydropower in Laos, taking account of all relevant environmental, social, legal and technical factors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AusAID funded short term advisers include a financial adviser and a costings engineer. Provision of a short term legal adviser and a full time "Environment Adviser" has recently been agreed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any advisers funded by AusAID have experience relevant to the Terms of Reference for which they are engaged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The Lao Government Hydropower Office, (HPO), is responsible for the scrutiny of social impacts of potential Projects on the local population. There has been concern regarding the HPO's  capacity to assess all proposals. Hence the support AusAID is providing through UNDP is highly valued in Laos, and supports the Lao Government's efforts to ensure all environmental and social impacts of projects are fully considered.</PARA></ANSWER></ANSWER.TO.QON></ANSWERS.TO.QUESTIONS></HANSARD>
