<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable gentleman for his question. There has been an outstanding response to the government's decision to sell AN to the three new owners we announced on Thursday last week in partnership with the Minister for Finance. There has been a lot of coverage in the media and a lot of response from union leaders and community representatives. For example, the Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> , a newspaper from the state greatly affected by the sale, said on its front page `We're back on the rails' and, in the shortest number of words, said what people who work for AN actually believe has 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7505"> happened as a result of this decision&mdash;we are back on the rails. A number of newspapers  commented very favourably. For example, the Launceston <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Examiner</EMPHASIS>  said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Cheaper rail freights likely . . . users can expect a better service.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS>  ran a profile on one of the apprentices who works for AN, a bloke by the name of Mark Edwards, who is featured on the front page. He is an apprentice boilermaker at the Port Augusta workshops. When he was interviewed, he said about the decision:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I'm definitely over the moon.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He is over the moon about the decision made by this government. We then go to people like community representatives. The Mayor of Port Augusta, Joy Baluch, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are now embarking on a new era . . . This will certainly promote confidence in the business sector.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Then we go to customers of AN. Mr John Lush of the South Australia Farmers Federation&mdash;farmers are one of the main customers of AN in South Australia&mdash;said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian National crisis is now over.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A window of opportunity exists for the South Australian country rail system to be rehabilitated.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Phillip Peterson, a TasRail customer, said in relation to the government's announcements last Thursday:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is what is most likely to bring investment and jobs to the State.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Then we can go to other political representatives like Democrat Senator John Woodley, who chaired the Senate inquiry into the sale of AN. On ABC Radio last week, following the announcement, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I've got to say that I'm really pleased. I mean, I'm really thrilled about it actually.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The union which represents drivers and service staff said that the decision that it was the `best possible outcome' for rail workers. Indeed, the Public Transport Union State Secretary for South Australia, Mr Rex Phillips, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . this is better than expected. Commonsense has prevailed . . . The emphasis has been on investment in the future, regional investment and most importantly jobs. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Electrical Trades Union representative, Frank Sghirripa, who works at the Port Augusta workshops, said of the decision:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It's the beginning of a new era for the Port Augusta community . . . the workers were looking forward to the future.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Australian Metal Workers Union representative, Mr Kym Thomas, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the union had fought hard to maintain jobs for the youth of Port Augusta, and that is now going to be achieved.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Australian Workers Union organiser at Port Augusta, Len Scharenerg, who has really worked out Labor on this issue, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it's either go down this path or go the way of the dinosaurs.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There are no prizes for guessing who he thinks the dinosaurs are. The dinosaurs are the people on the Labor side who, through their 13 years of mismanagement of AN, destroyed that company, particularly through their decision to create the National Rail Corporation the way they did.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are comments there from community leaders, political representatives, the customers of AN and from the workers, particularly people like the apprentices. There is only one thing that you can say about all of those comments; that is, they are all favourable. They all agree with the decision of this government to give AN a new future. The only people who do not agree with that decision are the Labor Party, who did so much damage to AN during their time in office, the same Labor Party who tried to block the sale of AN when the legislation when through the Senate. Those people in the Labor Party&mdash;the young and the heartless in particular&mdash;should be ashamed of themselves because they are the only ones out of step on this issue and the workers know about it. They have worked out what Labor is up to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The best way to sum up what people really think about this is to use the words of Mr Rex Phillips, the Public Transport Union State Secretary for South Australia, who said:</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8E4">Dr WOOLDRIDGE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So you can understand it, Leo, I will try. In a question to the Prime Minister last Thursday, the honourable member for Dobell asked about drugs of equal clinical value, and used the example of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Pravastatin&mdash;which is called a `statin' drug&mdash;which is a cholesterol lowering drug. He claimed that the trial had had to be stopped because it was so successful.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I went to check the honourable member's claims. In fact, what he is referring to is an article that appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New England Journal of Medicine</EMPHASIS>  in November 1995, which was about a trial of Pravastatin. But, unlike the honourable member's suggestion in the question about drugs of equal clinical value, Pravastatin was not compared with other drugs of equal value such as Simvastatin or Fluvastatin; it was compared with a sugar pill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should come as no surprise to honourable members, even those who lack the technical expertise to understand pharmacology, that a drug aimed at lowering cholesterol should be more effective than a sugar pill. I would make the point to the honourable member that this is the exact reason we take scientific evidence on the basis of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, and do not allow politicians to make arbitrary decisions on the misreading of an article where we compare one drug with a placebo.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Treasurer aware of burgeoning salary packaging practices by some state government instrumentalities&mdash;for example, favouring health care employees in Western Australia&mdash;which defeat his government's anti&hyphen;avoidance objectives? If so, what action does the Treasurer intend to take?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="7506" SPEAKER="Costello, Peter, MP" NAMEID="CT4" ELECTORATE="Higgins" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Treasurer" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CT4">Mr COSTELLO</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government takes such measures as are required to prevent legitimate taxation liabilities being avoided. In relation to packaging, of course the fringe benefits tax prevents packaging for the private sector out into non&hyphen;salary forms. We are aware that there are certain tax exempts which, because they are not subject to fringe benefits tax, it has been found are much more attractive to package into non&hyphen;salary benefits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is something that the government has looked at. But, on the occasions that it has looked at it, it has come to the conclusion that, by and large, tax exempts which do perform public services have a special position in the taxation system, and one that we 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7507"> recognise. However, I do make the point, as is regularly made to us, that where you have tax exempts which are competing against private sector operations you can get an advantage which your competitor does not  get. The principle of competitive neutrality would say that in those circumstances one has to be careful that the special tax system is not taken to such an extent that it becomes an unfair competitive advantage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is, of course, aware of this, and it supports the competitive neutrality principle generally. It is very much a part of our competition policy. Where things can be done by the private sector we encourage it to be done for that competitive neutrality reason. But I assure the honourable member, as he knows, this is a government that has been very vigorous against tax avoidance. We acted in relation to the undue generosity of benefits to high income earners for superannuation, we acted in relation to R&amp;D syndicates, we acted in relation to infrastructure borrowings and we acted in relation to foreign source income. This is a government that has been very active and vigilant, and we keep all of these areas under our constant attention.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

The El Nino effect is a matter of growing concern, particularly to people in my electorate of Wannon but also to people in many other parts of Australia.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4K4">Mr ANDERSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Wannon for his question. I know that the issue that he has raised is of great 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> concern to many people in this place, particularly those who represent rural electorates in the eastern part of the country where the predictions are, indeed, the most serious in terms of the potential impact of a fully developed El Nino weather pattern. We hope it does not happen. Even the scientists who are putting forward the predictions will not mind, I am sure, us saying that this time we sincerely hope they have got it wrong. Nonetheless, it is as well for us to know and to use the modern diagnostic tools and better forecasting capacities that are increasingly available to us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that in many parts of eastern Australia people are already looking at the very serious prospect of declining yields and, in some cases, even lost crop yields; there is no doubt that in many instances people are already turning off livestock in large numbers. There is no doubt that many are already looking at very real difficulties. The government is watching the situation very carefully. From the Prime Minister down we are conscious of the need to meet expectations not only of people in the bush but of all Australians that the government will do what it can to help ease the burden in rural Australia should this develop into another full&hyphen;scale drought. We hope it does not. But, if it does, whilst government assistance is no substitute for decent seasons and good prices, it can be a real help.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth noting that last week we re&hyphen;declared drought exceptional circumstances in the northern Darling Downs and South Burnett regions of Queensland at a cost of some $20 million. I know that the relevant members, Mr Slipper and Mr Truss, are particularly relieved. They have had several things to say to me about the matter in recent times. This re&hyphen;declaration is a recognition that the recovery that everyone, including farmers in those areas, believed was under way in June 1996 proved to be a false hope, a false dawn. Here is the demonstration that the drought exceptional circumstances systems, as we have finetuned them, are working.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The drought relief payment has again been extended for an estimated 5,000 or so farm families. When we came to office, the recovery period was just six months. We have

This is again demonstrating our commitment to rural people who are in difficulties and our willingness to help. In fact, the assistance is anything but paltry. In conclusion, I note that there will be a new program in place shortly to offer farm families a safety net when they lose access to the drought relief payment. All will shortly be revealed in the integrated rural policy package which has been alluded to since the time of the budget.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Last Friday meatworkers at the Stuart meatworks in Townsville came to me with concerns about their jobs in relation to the live export of cattle. They claim that the live export of cattle is affecting the jobs at the meatworks. Could you give me your comments on that please?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4K4">Mr ANDERSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. One of the very interesting developments in the Australian livestock industries in recent times has been the explosion in live exports, particularly in cattle from northern Australia, and the numbers have now reached very high levels. Some estimates indicate that the equivalent of throughput for some seven to 10 works are now leaving the country in live form, and that is understandably putting some pressure on domestic works. I note that processors have expressed some concern about that in recent times.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the last couple of years, I recall the answer from those opposite to their political mates in the union movement in relation to having a very successful live cattle export trade was to say, `We'll put an export tax on them.' It was a successful export trade, so they wanted to put a tax on the trade to make sure it was not successful. But the real name of the game here is to ensure that our processing works are as cost-effective and efficient as possible and that their costs are as low as they can be. Again, those opposite failed completely to grapple with that issue. They failed to deliver any meaningful reform at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The industrial relations changes that we have made are making a real difference. The reductions in interest rates are also making a real difference. In the last year under Labor, and members might be interested in this, the export meat sector in this country paid $62 million for meat inspection services; last year under us they paid $53 million&mdash;less, even without a subsidy. Just this afternoon I have completed dialogue with the meat industry which ensures that they will again pay $53 million this year, in contrast to $62 million in the last year under Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final point I would make on this issue is to offer some hope, because we are genuinely concerned about those jobs. There are jobs being generated by the live trade. It is also keeping in business many northern producers and the trucking companies and so forth that go with them. But we are concerned about the processing works as well. That is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7509"> why we want to give the meatworkers the opportunity to be more efficient and to preserve their jobs. One important aspect is that, often on the back of live exports, a boom in boxed beef exports can also be developed. I hope that takes place for the benefit not only of producers but also of those workers who  might otherwise see their jobs go in processing plants in northern Australia.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We always assist those who make genuine claims. Equally, they must be dealt with quickly and fairly as well. I think it is fair to say that we now have a proven record of success. Last week, 135 people from the Port Hedland detention centre were returned to China. These were the people who arrived in the Torres Strait in June from the Fujian province. I know there was a good deal of interest in that matter. Four people from that boat remain in Australia to assist us with further inquiries. Regrettably, the cost of removal is quite expensive. It was $590,000. I am sure no-one is pleased with having to incur this cost, but it is the only viable way of returning people with safety after an incursion of this type.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is remarkable that we now have only 55 people in our Port Hedland detention centre. Very much larger numbers of people were held in recent years. The centre has accommodation for more than 700 occupants. Since the coalition achieved office, about 900 people have arrived illegally by boat. The vast majority of those have been returned home on the basis that they failed to have any claims that met our protection obligations. In addition, we have been successful in arranging for the return home of large numbers of people who illegally arrived in the term of the previous government. It is a matter of some concern that has been drawn attention to before that, regrettably, over a period of time, numbers of people were held in detention for periods far longer than most reasonable people would have expected was appropriate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Parramatta for his question. I acknowledge his great commitment to young people in his electorate. From a number of visits that I have had to Aboriginal communities it is very clear to me that Aboriginal parents want 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> their children to be literate in English. Equally, it is also plain that many of these young Aboriginal students do not come from English speaking backgrounds and, indeed, in some cases English is actually their third language.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to inform the House that to help these students the government has decided to provide some $6.2 million a year for intensive English as a second language assistance for students who commence school for the first time next year. This is a very significant breakthrough in providing foundation English language skills for young Aboriginal students. It shows this government's commitment to addressing in a very practical way the literacy needs of all young Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The target group for this program will be young indigenous students living in communities in which little English is heard or spoken and who are therefore significantly disadvantaged when their first exposure to English is when they attend school. Each eligible student will attract funding to provide an average of 10 hours of intensive tuition per week for six months to enable them to reach a basic level of English communication. Eligibility for assistance will be based on a local assessment of language barriers to individual students' participation in the classroom, and it is expected that some 2,000 students will be eligible each year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to say that this initiative has been strongly welcomed by the Chairman of ATSIC, Mr Gatjil Djerrkura, who said that the injection of these funds is a start to addressing one of the real problems confronting young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is encouraging to see that the government recognises that our people face a language barrier and that they are prepared to assist us to overcome this situation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question, which seems to be a preface to the matter of public importance which is to be discussed this afternoon. There are a number of facts and figures on the question of job security. For example, a while ago Ross Gittins in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>  reported that he had asked AGB McNair to undertake a survey question, which  was, `How secure do you believe you are in your job at the moment?' Interestingly, only 4 per cent of the respondents in paid employment said that they felt very insecure and a further eight per cent said that they felt somewhat insecure. That left 25 per cent reasonably secure, 23 per cent secure, and 39 per cent very secure. It is true that, asked whether they felt more secure or less secure than they did a year ago, 18 per cent said that they felt less secure now; but against that 21 per cent said that they felt more secure, which left 60 per cent saying that they felt no difference. The recent AWIR study is also relevant to this, and there has been some interesting OECD material.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of more direct relevance is that if you ask in the public debate who is concerned about job security or insecurity, the Labor Party has a political tactic to raise the question of job security absolutely on every occasion. They get up in the morning and you say to them as they are walking along the corridor, `How do you feel today?', and they say, `We feel that job insecurity is on the rise.' If you say, `What's the weather like?', they say, `Job insecurity is on the rise.' In the trade union movement, they have got people going out with surveys promoting the idea of job insecurity and stress at work.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Push polling. The Australian Services Union is just one example of this. They have got a questionnaire containing six questions, the last of which is, `What do you feel would be the solutions to stress at work?' 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> The third question is, `Do you suffer from any of the following&mdash;never, sometimes, frequently?' Then it has got a list including headaches, indigestion and continual tiredness. It sounds like a description of those sitting on the front bench opposite. The interesting thing is that there is no reference to whether or not these conditions relate to people's work performance. This is a significant issue. The reality is that if people are to enjoy higher pay and secure jobs, then what Australia needs is a system which allows the terms and conditions of people's employment to relate to the circumstances of their work so that through higher productivity people can enjoy higher pay.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The questioner asks whether or not the government has fulfilled its commitment in respect of better pay for better work. No better and more graphic demonstration of us fulfilling that commitment is the recent decision of the Industrial Relations Commission to give a $10 a week safety net wage increase to the low paid. Compare the reality of $10 in your pocket, which is a 2.6 per cent real change&mdash;that is, an increase in real wages for those most disadvantaged&mdash;to the situation that applied in the years from March 1984 to March 1996, when Labor was in government, when the minimum wages of those disadvantaged in our society actually fell by 10 per cent or more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thank you very much for the question. Thank you for the MPI. The reality is that in government we are fulfilling our promises. What a stark contrast that makes to the years that Labor was in office delivering real wage declines for low income workers.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On coming to government last year we had a review done of the 12 business units of the Department of Administrative Services, and you would remember that in the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7515"> August 1996 budget a decision was made to sell eight of those 12 business units. That decision was made for a number of reasons. A number of the enterprises had been losing quite a lot of money. Some of them were restricted by tremendous bureaucratic overheads. There were constitutional problems with some of them. Access to capital was another real problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to inform the House that four of the business units have now been transferred to private ownership. They are: Dasfleet, DAS Distribution, Works Australia and Australian Operational Support Services.  Yesterday I was delighted to receive a cheque for $407.9 million from Macquarie Bank for the sale of Dasfleet. The remaining four business units&mdash;Interiors Australia, the Australian Property Group, DASCEM and Asset Services&mdash;will be transferred to private ownership between now and early October 1997. These sales were certainly part of the government's agenda for smaller government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am absolutely delighted to inform the House that we have achieved a very positive outcome for staff, with some 80 per cent of our staff who applied for jobs across all the business units being successful in gaining employment with the new owners. A great deal has been done too in terms of our outsourcing, and areas such as Nomad, Auslig, the Australian Government Publishing Service and support services have now been contracted out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the interesting things&mdash;it is probably the first time it has been done by a government, certainly to my knowledge, anywhere in the world&mdash;is that provision was made for the staff of these business enterprises to in fact buy out the businesses. Obviously, they had to compete with the private sector in those bids. At least two of these businesses will be taken over by the staff. Some people have been critical of what might happen to the staff members who did not go with their businesses. I think this department probably has the best redeployment, retraining and career counselling program, and those staff have been looked after.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;On behalf of the government, I announce today a comprehensive set of financial system reforms in response to the recommendations of the financial system inquiry, the Wallis report. This is a major structural reform by the government which will deliver billions of dollars of benefits for Australian business and consumers. In line with our election commitments, upon taking office the government moved quickly to set up the financial system inquiry, headed by Mr Stan Wallis. I take this opportunity to thank Mr Wallis for the job he did, together with his fellow inquiry members&mdash;Mr Bill Beerworth, Professor Ian Harper, Professor Jeff Carmichael and Mrs Linda Nicholls.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The inquiry delivered a high quality report making 115 recommendations for regulatory reform in the Australian financial system. The report was directed to the fundamental goals of the government, to increase competition and improve efficiency, while preserving the integrity, security and fairness of the financial system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The system now provides annually over $40 billion worth of services to consumers and other sectors of the economy, directly employs over 300,000 people and plays an 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> increasingly important role as a service export industry. The performance of the financial system and the cost effectiveness of its regulation are critical to the efficient functioning of the whole economy:</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> and in its own right, the financial industry can make an increasing contribution to Australia's economic welfare and progress.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Rationale and Goals for Reform</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Wallis inquiry concluded that efficiency, choice and quality in Australia's financial sector has improved since the major deregulation measures of the 1980s. After nearly two decades, now is the time to improve the system further. There are three main reasons. Firstly, in a globally competitive world we must strive to be the best. Given its contribution to every other sector of the economy, creating the best possible financial system provides a vital foundation to Australia's future economic success. The Wallis inquiry found Australia's financial sector performance to be close to the world average rather than among the world's best.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="DOT" TYPE="NORMAL"> In every area, there remains room for further improvement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="DOT" TYPE="NORMAL"> Reform is needed to secure those potential gains.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, we must maintain the pace of reform to respond to change. The financial system is undergoing accelerated change through rapid technological innovation, increasing globalisation and changing business strategies and consumer needs. Our regulatory arrangements must keep up. Existing arrangements do not treat all new market structures and activities equally, and do not always ensure that we get the maximum benefits from change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, the Wallis inquiry found that there are a number of areas of the financial system which could be more competitive, and proposed a number of ways to promote more competition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="DOT" TYPE="NORMAL"> The government is keen to pursue all of these initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The proposals I am announcing today will:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="DOT" TYPE="NORMAL"> help obtain for Australian consumers and industry the potential benefits of new 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7517"> technologies and world's best practice in the financial system, and at the same time maximise the international competitiveness of our financial services industries;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="DOT" TYPE="NORMAL"> better focus regulation according to its underlying objectives and ensure that it applies in a competitively neutral way across the newly emerging market structures; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="DOT" TYPE="NORMAL"> promote greater competition, and through it the achievement of greater efficiency, across the spectrum of financial and payments services.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">At the same time, the reforms that I am announcing today build on the advantages of the existing arrangements, preserving the basic goals of safety and stability.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">OVERVIEW OF PROPOSED REFORMS</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn now to the main proposals for reform of regulatory arrangements in the financial system. The key elements of this package are a new organisational framework for the regulation of the financial system and a variety of measures to improve efficiency and contestability in financial markets and the payments system.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Rationalisation of the Regulatory Framework</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has decided to establish a new regulatory structure based on three agencies. Each agency will be responsible across the system for clear regulatory objectives.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The government has decided:</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> firstly, that the Reserve Bank of Australia will be strengthened and its role focused on the objectives of monetary policy, overall financial system stability and regulation of the payments system. As part of this, a new Payments System Board will be appointed within the Reserve Bank with stronger regulatory powers to ensure safety, greater competition and efficiency in the payments system;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> secondly, an Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, APRA, will be established to prudentially supervise deposit taking 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> institutions, life and general insurance companies and superannuation funds; and</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> thirdly, an Australian Corporations and Financial Services Commission, ACFSC, will be established to cover market integrity, disclosure and other consumer protection issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new regulatory agencies will have substantial operational autonomy and a clear charter of objectives. They will have boards of directors or commissioners responsible for operational and administrative policies, and will be accountable to the Treasurer and the parliament for their performance. There will be legislative provisions to authorise the exchange of confidential information amongst the three regulators and there will be close co&hyphen;operation between them, both bilaterally and through a Council of Financial Regulators responsible for coordination across a wide range of issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In principle, the government considers that regulation of building societies, credit unions, friendly societies and possibly other financial entities should come under this scheme, and will facilitate this transfer from state to Commonwealth regulation if the states and territories also agree. Given the importance of settling the future of these sectors as soon as possible, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) will be asking the states and territories to determine in principle their positions before the end of this year.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Balancing Prudential and Competition Goals</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Wallis inquiry concluded that prudential regulation should maintain safety while being sufficiently flexible to respond to financial system developments. Prudential arrangements should also minimise adverse effects on competition, competitive neutrality and efficiency. The government agrees with this general approach. We have decided to establish a single licensing and prudential regulation regime for all deposit taking institutions. This will achieve more neutral regulatory treatment and maintain financial safety across all providers of similar deposit products.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7518">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Non-bank deposit taking institutions will more readily operate on a national scale and provide more effective competition for banks in the retail market. The new regime will provide a flexible approach to prudential regulation to deal with the unique characteristics of different deposit taking institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Licensing and prudential regulation of life insurance products, as for deposit taking, should be provided under a consistent and competitively neutral regime. Therefore, subject to the agreement of the states and territories, we propose that the financial business of friendly societies be subject to the same regulatory arrangements as life offices. To encourage new entry and more effective competition the government will also:</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> facilitate the establishment of non&hyphen;operating bank holding companies, and allow holding  companies to own more than one bank or other licensed entities;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> streamline the process of licence issue, transferring responsibility to the prudential regulator;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> remove prohibitions on mutual ownership of banks;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> facilitate possible future participation of a wider range of entities in the deposit taking market; and</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> streamline the regulation of financial institution shareholdings with a single ceiling of 15 per cent above which government approvals must be obtained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The broad objectives of prudential regulation will be set out in the charter of the regulator. In setting these objectives, the government will broadly follow the approaches to the conduct of prudential regulation recommended by the Wallis inquiry, ensuring that standards of financial safety are not diminished. In particular, the conduct of regulation will ensure that the risk of loss of depositor funds remains, as now, very remote and that regulation is consistent with international standards. Prudential standards will as far as possible be reinforced through encouraging greater public disclosure by financial institutions of their risks, management systems and ratings.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Total superannuation savings have reached $280 billion and are growing at a much faster rate than bank deposits. They are vital to the retirement security of millions of Australians and for increasing numbers of people represent by far the greater part of their total financial assets. The APRA will take responsibility for the prudential regulation of superannuation funds and retirement savings accounts. This will create more consistent and effective prudential arrangements for this rapidly growing sector, enhancing its safety while facilitating greater choice, competition and efficiency.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Maintaining Protection of Depositors</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As part of its package of reforms, the government will fully maintain and in some areas strengthen the effectiveness of the existing arrangements for the protection of depositors. There will be no lessening of protection for bank deposits from that which is currently provided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The existing depositor protection provisions will be retained under the Banking Act and extended to all licensed deposit takers. This will involve extending to all regulated deposit taking institutions the priority over the assets of an institution now afforded only to bank depositors. This will apply for the first time to deposits in building societies and credit unions if they join the Commonwealth regulatory scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The APRA, instead of the Reserve Bank, will be responsible for dealing with institutions which are unable to meet their obligations, but will undertake this action in close cooperation with the Reserve Bank. The Reserve Bank will retain its existing role in providing liquidity support to financial institutions if such assistance is required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The operational effectiveness of the depositor protection provisions will be strengthened, by providing powers for early intervention in a financially troubled institution and by making clear that the regulator can wind up an insolvent entity. The APRA will also be given enhanced powers to take action in the case of financial difficulties experienced by life and general insurance companies, and superannuation funds. APRA will be a sepa

<PARA STYLE="Para">Promoting Efficiency, Competition and Confidence in the Payments System</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has accepted recommendations for further measures to promote efficiency and competition, as well as safety and confidence, in the payments system. The payments system is a particularly important, yet little understood, part of the economy. It is the infrastructure that enables resources to be traded and goods to be exchanged. The smooth functioning of the economy relies on confidence in the payments system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Wallis report concluded that there is considerable scope to increase efficiency in the payments system without compromising its safety. The government accepts there is a need for greater oversight of the payments  system. A Payments System Board and new regulatory powers will be established within the Reserve Bank to regulate clearing and settlement systems, to control risk in the financial system and to promote efficiency and competition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Reserve Bank will have the power to ensure that clearing stream bodies provide access to their facilities to third parties on reasonable terms. Access to clearing streams and settlement accounts would be liberalised on the basis of clear and open guidelines determined by the PSB. These guidelines will ensure there is no compromise in safety and stability objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Greater competition in payments services will be possible from new types of players processing payments on behalf of their customers. The development and application of new payment technologies also have the potential to reduce considerably the costs of financial services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To ensure that they continue to develop with consumer confidence and do not undermine the safety of the financial system, the funds underlying general payments instruments such as electronic cash and stored value cards will be subject to prudential regulation. The government has taken careful note of the inquiry's comments relating to ensuring that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> there are no impediments to migrating from paper based payments instruments such as cheques to lower cost electronic payment instruments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government accepts that financial institutions will need to reflect the cost advantages of more efficient systems in the overall pricing structure of their services. At the same time, the government is not yet assured that the financial system is adequately competitive to ensure that pricing is always fair. Accordingly, it will continue to monitor informally developments in relation to financial sector fees and charges and will oppose any unfair or uncompetitive practices.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Promoting More Effective Disclosure and Consumer Protection</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The inquiry also made a range of recommendations aimed at achieving more effective and efficient disclosure regulation, better regulation of securities and futures markets, promoting the coordination and extension of dispute resolution schemes and overhauling the regulation of financial advice. The government has endorsed a range of recommendations aimed at achieving more effective disclosure and consumer protection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Financial sector conduct and disclosure regulation is currently undertaken by a variety of regulatory agencies. The main disadvantages with this are that: regulation is inconsistent across the range of competing financial products; financial service providers face a range of different regulatory rules that raises the complexity and cost of compliance; and consumers face inconsistent rules resulting in difficulties in understanding and comparing competing products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For these reasons a single market integrity and consumer protection regulator will be established&mdash;the Australian Corporations and Financial Services Commission. The agreement of the states and the Northern Territory will be required since this commission will exercise all of the current powers of the Australian Securities Commission. The new commission will be given comprehensive market integrity and consumer protection functions across the range of Commonwealth level interests in the financial system.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7520">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to current powers, the commission will be given the same general consumer protection laws to enforce as currently exist under the consumer protection provisions of the Trade Practices Act as well as a range of enforcement powers. This framework legislation would provide specific regulation in certain areas and allow for industry codes of practice in others, provided they are cost&hyphen;effective and fully meet essential standards and coverage requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Trade Practices Act will continue to have universal application administered by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. However, arrangements will be made to provide that the ACFSC undertakes full responsibility for consumer protection issues arising in the financial system. This will improve the level of specialist financial services consumer protection regulation in Australia as well as remove areas of duplica tion and inconsistency which are ultimately costly to the consumer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Disclosure requirements for retail financial products will be reviewed by the new regulator to ensure they provide information which enables comparison between products. In particular, I want to ensure that disclosure information is: comprehensible and sufficient to enable consumers to make informed decisions; consistent with that for similar products regardless of which institution offers them; and sufficient to identify remuneration or commissions paid to advisers. The government also endorses the inquiry recommendation for a single gateway for consumer complaints and dispute resolution and will act on this as soon as possible.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Other Measures to Promote Efficiency</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will be pursuing a number of other initiatives to promote financial system efficiency. Further study will be undertaken of the potential economic benefits of changes in credit reporting and intra&hyphen;group information sharing arrangements and of options for alternative instruments for social security payments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The implications of foreign investment policy for life offices and other funds managers will be reviewed as part of a broader 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> review of foreign investment policy. Regulatory responsibility for self&hyphen;managed superannuation funds will be transferred from the Insurance and Superannuation Commission to the Australian Taxation Office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once the new regulatory arrangements have been fully implemented, the existing requirement that banks hold non&hyphen;callable deposits at the Reserve Bank will be abolished. This will eliminate a competitive disadvantage of licensed banks compared with their unlicensed competitors and ensure that all licensed deposit taking institutions face the same regulatory arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, the government also will establish closer consultation arrangements with the private sector on financial sector issues. A Financial Sector Advisory Council will be established to provide the Treasurer with ongoing advice on financial sector developments and policies. The members of the council will be drawn wholly from the private sector and a secretariat will be provided by my department.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The financial system inquiry and the many other financial system initiatives already announced by this government have received strong support in Australia and favourable recognition overseas. The reform package that I announce today represents the government's most substantial step yet to improve Australia's financial system. Further details of the measures we are taking are contained in the document I now table.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister is writing today to the premiers and chief ministers seeking the cooperation and support of the states and territories. The government will also consult widely with industry and consumers on the details of the various reforms. Further reforms in the areas of disclosure requirements and other areas of the Corporations Law will be progressed through the government's corporate law economic reform program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A series of comprehensive papers containing proposals for reform will be issued over coming weeks, dealing with fundraising, takeovers, futures and securities markets, director's duties and electronic commerce. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7521"> After consultation processes are completed, legislative proposals will be presented to parliament early next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is in all of our interests to press on with these changes. In pursuing these reforms, I look forward to continuing close cooperation with the states and territories and with the financial industry itself. The financial sector lies at the heart of the entire economy, and we all depend on its success.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The measures I have announced today will facilitate greater choice and competition in financial services. They will encourage more rapid innovation, providing wider access and enhanced levels of service. Australia will have a world class regulatory structure that ensures the highest standards of prudence and safety and consumer protection. Regulation will be more efficient, with greater consistency and less overlap. More openly contested markets will drive lower industry costs and prices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These benefits will flow to all areas, including small business, those in rural and remote areas and consumers generally. At the same time, Australia's financial system will be positioned to compete strongly in the global economy and to continue to grow as a service export industry. The government's initiatives will ensure that Australia's financial system provides the best possible foundation for the continued development and growth of the whole Australian economy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The opposition welcomes the fact that the government has, after more than five months, finally got around to announcing its response to the Wallis financial system inquiry. Today's statement by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) at last tells us where the government is intending to go on the report's more detailed recommendations. Subject to some concerns and reservations about particular matters which I will come back to later and subject of course to reservations about not yet having seen the detail of the government's legislation, I can indicate that the opposition 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is in broad agreement with the substance of the Wallis report and its recommendations and with, accordingly, the government's acceptance of those recommendations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do understand that some of the issues raised by Wallis are highly technical, but I have to say that a five&hyphen;month delay in providing the kind of response we have heard today to the report is inexcusable for a government which has behind it all the bureaucratic might of the Treasury. In fact, it was not until the opposition announced a couple of weeks ago its in&hyphen;principle support for the basic Wallis regulatory structure that we saw any sign at all of government action on this report. This kind of delay is really very typical of a government that is all drift, indecision and muddle. Here, as elsewhere, it takes the opposition to provide leadership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The long delay involved has adversely affected the financial services industry. All the major players have had to put a lot of their planning on hold as they wait for the future regulatory structure of the industry to be determined. Indeed I note that the government is not proposing to introduce legislation to implement any of its decisions today until some time into 1998 and, moreover, that the transfer of responsibilities from the states, which is a very important part of bringing this whole scheme to fruition so far at least as building societies and credit unions and so on are concerned, will not take place until July 1999. So I do urge the government to get its act together. Try to improve your relationship with the states. Get a bit of speed up and get the regulatory system effectively into place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me begin my response to the substance of this report by just saying a few words about the Wallis committee report in its context. The Wallis report is widely considered to be the most important review of the financial system since the Campbell report in 1981, but, as important as it is and as useful as it is, this ain't no Campbell report. The simple fact is that the changes recommended by Wallis, while they are quite far reaching, are still relatively small beer compared with floating the dollar, opening up the banking system to foreign banks and deregulating as we did most of the financial system.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7522">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Treasurer may want to claim these things as his own but these are Labor's achievements. The deregulation that took place through the 1980s has brought significant benefits for consumers and business: there is now much greater competition in key markets such as the market for housing and finance, consumers have access to a much wider range of financial products, and there has been substantial innovation in products offered by financial institutions with Wallis counting some 1,760 differentiated mortgage products now on the market and another 1,800 deposit products as the fruit of that kind of deregulation. Before deregulation many borrowers were forced to supplement their regulated bank home loans with personal loans of higher interest rates, and these cocktail loans have now disappeared.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although deregulation has brought tremendous benefits for business and consumers, it has not also been without its significant transition costs and disappointments, not least of those associated with the explosive and undisciplined credit expansion of the mid to late 1980s. But I think it is fair to say that the system is certainly now working a lot better. It has learnt a lot from those excesses. In particular, it is worth emphasising that the housing mortgage market is much more competitive than it has ever been and there are some hopeful signs of greater competition as well emerging in the market for small business lending.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Treasurer shamelessly claims that this greater competition is his own achievement, but anyone with the most cursory knowledge of the financial markets and how they have been working in these institutional frameworks knows that this competition developed before Labor left office. It has got nothing whatsoever to do with any changes introduced by the coalition government. Although an important part of the Wallis report is concerned with stocktaking the effects of that deregulation over the past decade, obviously what it is basically about is the future and, in particular, the appropriate regulatory structure for the Australian financial system in the 21st century.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth saying that a Wallis&hyphen;type inquiry into the financial system would have occurred no matter which side of politics had won the last election. As Treasurer, the member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) foreshadowed the eventual need for it; Treasury had already commenced planning for a major inquiry, I can assure the Treasurer, despite his wishful thinking to the contrary, before we left office; and, indeed, an inquiry of this kind would have had to have been conducted under our national competition policy guidelines which required a review of the relevant legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor does understand the profound change that has been sweeping through the finance industry and the need for a new regulatory response to it. This change is the product of the financial deregulation which has already occurred, plus stunning continuing technological process and the impact here, as elsewhere, of globalisation. In the past, banks, life offices, superannuation funds and general insurers operated in quite distinct markets. However, with these other phenomena occurring&mdash;financial deregulation and so on&mdash;the differences between the products offered by these various institutions are becoming increasingly blurred. Life offices are now offering deposit type products which were once virtually the sole preserve of banks; super funds are entering the home mortgage market&mdash;so are the new mortgage originators; and the banks are offering superannuation and general insurance products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are no signs at all of any slowing in this convergence in the services operated by different financial institutions. If anything, the trend seems to be accelerating. As a consequence, we have to put in place a new regulatory framework to accommodate these changes. That is what the Wallis report recommends.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the heart of the recommendations are those to create two new regulatory bodies, dealing with prudential supervision on one side and consumer protection on the other. What Wallis does not propose&mdash;or, indeed, give any consideration to&mdash;is the manifestly ill&hyphen;considered proposal that was originally put forward by the Treasurer for a single mega&hyphen; 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7523">regulator. That would have been an absolute bureaucratic monster. It would have ensured that, both on the prudential and on the consumer protection side, we saw standards slipping in the context of that kind of regulatory nightmare.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On prudential regulation, the Wallis proposal embraced by the government is that supervision of financial institutions, including those in the insurance industry, be undertaken by a new body, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, or APRA. APRA would pick up many of the current prudential supervisory responsibilities of the Reserve Bank, the Insurance and Superannuation Commission and the financial institutions scheme. The Reserve Bank, however, would continue to have responsibility for overall system stability, maintaining very close liaison with APRA, in particular, in arrangements for the provision of liquidity in dealing with the financial difficulties that might be experienced by banks and other licensed deposit taking institutions. The opposition is very supportive  of the Reserve continuing to have that role; it is crucial.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also worth mentioning in this context that the Reserve will have the responsibility for oversight of the payments system, with the establishment within it of a new payments system board. There is a very significant job for that board to do. Given the decision to open up the payments system to some new types of player, we will be looking very closely at the actual implementation arrangements for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Going back to the creation of the single prudential regulator, APRA, in the form proposed, we do support that. There are no compelling arguments against moving to a new structure that will accommodate more naturally the profound changes that are taking place in the financial services market. On the other hand, there are some quite compelling arguments for bringing all deposit taking institutions under a single prudential regulatory body, the most obvious argument being that this will help to achieve a more level playing field between the banks, the credit unions and building societies.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Wallis inquiry was presented with quite substantial evidence that the state based regulatory scheme for credit unions and building societies, while having raised prudential standards considerably from what they were before, was nonetheless still cumbersome, duplicative and costly. As a result, the report found that if credit unions and building societies `are to be an effective source of competition for the banks in the retail market, it is fundamental that they be able to operate on a national basis and to compete on the same regulatory terms as banks'. The opposition supports that key finding of the report. We hope that the states and territories, with a bit of encouragement, support and cooperation from the Commonwealth, will respond quickly and unanimously to the recommendation that they bring their relevant institutions under the national scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new approach to prudential regulation proposed by the Wallis report would see the application of consistent depositor protection arrangements to all deposit taking institutions. The opposition believes that that will be of considerable benefit to credit union and building society customers. With the credit unions in particular filling the gap left by the banks in many rural and regional communities, it is vitally important that credit union customers be covered by the same depositor protection rules as bank customers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have already stated our view in the opposition that the current system of depositor protection for banks has functioned well and should be the core of future depositor protection arrangements. We are pleased to see that the government has followed our lead again and not gone down the path of removing depositor protection provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We recognise, as the Treasurer said, that new legislation will be required to extend the existing depositor protection provisions of the Banking Act to other deposit taking institutions. The government must not use this process to water down the level of protection that is currently enjoyed by bank customers. I heard the Treasurer's statement today that that is not the government's intention. I simply say to him that we will be looking 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7524"> with a very beady eye when the legislation comes in to ensure that that remains the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When it comes to consumer protection on a wider scale, the current regulation of financial services in Australia is manifestly highly fragmented and in need of some consolidation. The Insurance and Superannuation Commission, the Australian Securities Commission, the Reserve Bank, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the Australian Payments System Council, state and territory bodies responsible for administering state fair trading laws&mdash;all of them have consumer protection responsibilities in this area. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, it makes good sense for the current fragmented arrangements to be rationalised in a new body, as the Wallis report proposes, as the government has now said that it will do, and the opposition supports that general approach. We simply hope that the proposed new Australian Corporations and Financial Services Commission, the ACFSC, is properly funded and resourced to ensure that it can perform properly the proposed new regulatory functions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While it is logical that this new body, the ACFSC, acts as the day to day consumer protection and market conduct regulator for the financial services sector, we do believe, however, that the ACCC should retain its role as the economy wide regulator, without exception, of consumer protection. The ACCC has real teeth, has been willing to use them and should not be gutted. Although there is obviously scope for some resource rationalisation with the new body, some allocation of responsibility in such a way as not to ensure day to day duplication, overlap and confusion, we do have a concern&mdash;and this is one difference which I think is there; it is a bit hard to tell the extent of the difference given that we have not yet seen the legislation&mdash;based on the fact that we are worried that the ACCC would be completely dealt out of consumer protection in the financial services industry and that dealing it out in this way would be the first step towards the fragmentation of a genuinely economy wide approach to consumer regulation.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are saying is that, at the very least, the ACCC and the ACFSC should maintain a close working relationship, preferably under a clear operating agreement, with the ACCC retaining a reserve capacity, which you would not expect often to be utilised, to intervene to enforce the consumer protection provisions of the Trade Practices Act if it is becoming apparent that there is some shift away from a uniformity of regulatory approach. Maintaining strong consumer protection is absolutely essential in this area, as elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that context, I emphasise that one area of great difference between the opposition and the government goes to the question of consumer protection in the context of bank fees and charges. Wallis recommends that banks and other financial institutions should have complete freedom to set fees and charges `without government intervention or suasion'. The Treasurer, unsurprisingly, supports that recommendation boots and all, and in doing it today he sent a green light to the banks, and indeed to the other financial institutions, to go ahead and keep raising their fees and charges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That open slather approach runs right against the Prices Surveillance Authority's 1995 report into retail transaction fees and charges. Among other things, that report found that there was a need for the ACCC not to informally but to formally monitor fees and charges. The government has consistently rejected our calls for such a formal monitor, an issue which has become very much more lively as successive interest rate reductions have come into effect, as the banks' margins have narrowed and as they are looking now to fees and charges to earn a much greater proportion of their profits. The best that the Treasurer can offer today is a promise to continue informally monitoring fees and charges. Frankly, that is not worth tuppence&hyphen;halfpenny. Fees and charges will continue to spiral so long as there is no more formal monitoring process and, indeed, regulatory process put in place.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7525">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Treasurer says that formal monitoring is unnecessary because consumer power is going to help keep fees and charges down, but consumer power can only begin to work when consumers have complete information about the alternatives that are available so they can in fact shop around to get the best deal. The trouble is&mdash;as I guess we all know in the real world&mdash;consumers are completely bamboozled by the fees and charges jungle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last week Dr David Cousins, the former head of the PSA, one of Australia's foremost experts on bank fees and charges, admitted in a letter to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> that even finds it difficult to get consistent information on fees and charges which he can understand. The lack of authoritative, readily available and easy to understand information on the array of fees and charges in the marketplace today is a major market failure. There is a compelling need for the government to address that failure by directing the competition watchdog&mdash;ACCC&mdash;to formally monitor fees and charges, to make that information widely available so that ordinary people can in fact shop around and keep competitive pressure on the banks and on the other institutions to offer consumers a better deal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The remaining area where we significantly depart from Wallis is that which was given no attention at all in the Treasurer's statement today&mdash;I suppose, he said everything he wanted to say on the subject in his initial response to Wallis back in April&mdash;and that is the subject of bank mergers and mergers between the major institutions in this sector. We have a very strong difference with Wallis in its recommendation to scrap the so&hyphen;called four&hyphen;pillars policy which has prohibited mergers between the major four banks. When the Wallis report was released in April the government did not rule out scrapping the four&hyphen;pillars policy at some point in the future. Today's statement by the Treasurer has not changed that position because he was silent on the subject.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make it very clear for the record that Labor is steadfastly opposed to mergers 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> between the major banks. We already have one of the most concentrated banking systems in the world and further mergers between the major banks would lead to even greater concentration and less competition. In addition, consistent with the ACCC's decision in the 1995 Westpac&hyphen;Challenge case, we believe that strong regional competitors in each of the states are necessary to promote competition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, that ACCC position has now been watered down by the recent Westpac&hyphen;Bank of Melbourne decision, a decision which, while on the face of it sets some conditions which modify the impact of the merger, only does so for a relatively short time and I think at the end of the day the consequences are going to be unhappy for consumers. The simple fact is that retail customers and small businesses bank locally&mdash;they do not bank nationally, they do not bank internationally&mdash;and strong regional competitors to the major banks to keep them honest in those local environments are therefore absolutely vital to competition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also appropriate for me to restate here the opposition's concern with the government's decision announced last April to implement the Wallis recommendation to scrap the so&hyphen;called `six&hyphen;pillars policy'. The six&hyphen;pillars policy, otherwise know as the `majors policy', was implemented by the Labor government to prevent mergers between the major four banks and the two large life offices. While the degree of job shedding would be far less than that produced by a merger between two of the major banks, nonetheless a merger between a major bank and a major life office would involve substantial job shedding. We remain very concerned about that prospect and we are concerned that, as usual, as predictable and as is to be expected, the government obviously remains utterly unconcerned about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet another subject related to the role and financing of the banks and the relationships between them is the question of foreign ownership. I want to take this opportunity, again for the sake of completeness, to repeat the opposition's concern on the question of foreign ownership of the major banks. The Wallis report says there should be no special 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7526"> restrictions on foreign ownership of the major banks. The Treasurer said back in April only that there would not be `open slather' on foreign ownership, but his idea of when the slather starts will make a great many people nervous. Our position is one of blanket prohibition against foreign takeovers of any of the major banks, and that is a position which we believe, in the national interest and in the interest of Australian consumers, must be retained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I have identified those areas of the Wallis report and the Treasurer's response to it where we do have significant concerns. I have also indicated those areas where we will be scrutinising with a very beady eye indeed the government's legislation when it is eventually introduced. But it is fair to say&mdash;and I say it&mdash;that generally speaking the Wallis committee has made a major and very useful contribution to the ongoing modernisation of a key sector of the Australian economy. We would have established such an inquiry ourselves and the proposals that have here emerged and have now been accepted by the government are broadly consistent with those which we ourselves would have embraced.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday we established fairly clearly that the rock solid guarantee was not ever worth very much; it was not a core promise. We were able to refer to that quote from the Chief Executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You have to remember that the statement was said in the context of a political campaign. It was just a casual comment. It was an ideal, not a commitment.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It was obviously what the opinion poll of the day said, but the opinion polling must have changed, because the policy has changed. Nobody believes that any more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The promise to maintain the workers' awards if they wished to stay on them has been shattered. The awards as workers knew 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7527"> them no longer exist. They are being wound back to 20 allowable matters, and we have secret unreviewable contracts which can be unilaterally imposed to override awards. These are not agreements mutually agreed; these are conditions of appointment which you must accept. You do have a choice: you can accept the agreement or you can go without the job. That is the choice you have. Those two promises are long gone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we find now and what we are worried about today is the loss of better pay for better work. Let us have a look at the facts; let us be a little bit empirical about this. First of all, let us have a look at better pay. The overall figures show that percentage changes in ordinary time earnings have been slowing over the past three quarters. Over the last three quarters, they have gone down from 0.8 per cent to 0.7 per cent to 0.6 per cent to 0.5 per cent. Each quarter since the middle of last year, since this government took over, those things have been falling.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Mr McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If you would like me to quote the average weekly earnings for May 1997, if you would like to read it, it is saying that data is beginning to emerge about falling wages in all employees' total earnings and in full&hyphen;time ordinary time earnings in the private sector&mdash;both fell. But those are rather preliminary indications. What we do know is that there is a consistent pattern showing that the rate of increase is falling. Real wage declines in the private sector are beginning to emerge.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government made a miserable offer, based on awards, to people of $8. If the government's offer had been accepted a lot of people would have got nothing. But of course the industrial relations&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="REITH" NAMEID="WI4">

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"></INTERJECT>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Mr McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But your proposal deliberately restricted the number of people who could get an increase. Your submission to the national wage case was deliberately set out so that 600,000 workers would get nothing. You know it is true because you wrote it. The fact of it is that that is what would have happened. Fortunately, the commission rejected that and gave a little bit more&mdash;$10. Those figures are on the public record. The commission gave a little bit more, but subsequent indications show that, within all the most conservative parameters about inflation, it could have been substantially more.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us not forget that 33 per cent of workers depend on the award to determine their rates of pay. Those people's circumstances are getting consistently worse. We have got falling wages and worse. The results are getting increasingly unfair. In the last 12 months to June 1997 workers on the award received an average increase of 1.4 per cent. I know people will say, `Oh, but inflation is falling,' but go into the households of the people who depend on that 1.4 per cent and ask what is happening to the things they pay for. In the last 12 months the price of food went up 3.2 per cent; in exactly the same 12&hyphen;month period&mdash;the 12 months to June 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The price of health care has gone up 7.2 per cent. That is what ordinary Australian workers are paying for. The people on those lower incomes are not getting the benefit of the fall in mortgages in their weekly pay so that they have the capacity to meet their living standards. We know&mdash;the statistics make it clear&mdash;that in the bottom two quintiles, in the bottom 40 per cent of income earning households, a very low percentage of people are paying off mortgages. It is in the order of 10 or 11 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet, at the same time, while things are getting increasingly unfair for those people, things are getting pretty good at the top end of town. The latest Cullen Egan Dell survey showed quite clearly that executive salaries 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7528"> increased by 5.8 per cent in the same 12-month period to June. We also find this morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Happy days are here again&mdash;if you are in the richest 5 per cent of the population . . . the wealthy are cashed-up and spending freely again in a style reminiscent of the 1980s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . French champagne sales are up 20 per cent in a year. BMW sales have grown even faster over the past 12 months, while plenty of well-heeled property owners in inner Sydney and Melbourne have enjoyed price rises of 30 per cent or more in that time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">But there is not much of that happening in Blacktown, in Dandenong or in the working-class suburbs of any of our cities. There is not much of it going on in Newcastle or Geelong where people are living in fear&mdash;fear of loss of their jobs and loss of their family income. You do not see a lot of BMWs driving around Lithgow these days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the government's response? It has introduced an industrial relations system expressly designed to make the outcome more unfair. Those who have the bargaining power can win bigger increases and those who cannot get nothing or worse. I reiterate: 33 per cent of Australian workers depend on the award system to establish their rate of pay. What in the new system helps these people? How do they get a fair share of the wealth they are helping to create? So much for better pay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All you get from Australian workers about the proposal that under this government they  are getting better pay is a rather sad sort of horse laugh. But the situation is even worse when it comes to better working conditions. Before the election, the government really did not address what for many workers are the biggest issues: they are working longer; they are working harder; they are working more antisocial hours; and they are working under more stress&mdash;stress about whether they will have a job, about what sort of job it will be, about what the wages and working conditions will be, about how they will adapt those working hours and that change in income to meet their family and social commitments and about whether their kids will have a job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister in question time tried to cast some doubt on whether there is increasing 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> social concern about the issue of job security by throwing in some data. But let us have a look at what some research done in March by Clemengers says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What are people concerned about? Recent changes in workforce participation patterns, however, clearly worry many. The one problem seen as equally disturbing across all age groups is a lack of job security. The most vulnerable groups, the part-time and the unemployed, were particularly perturbed, as were blue-collar workers.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The statistics are pretty strong. The following were very concerned about lack of job security: 41 per cent of the sample&mdash;50 per cent of part-time workers, 46 per cent of unemployed people and 45 per cent of blue-collar workers. What we have is an increasing concern about job security from people in work and from those in households where perhaps there is now only one part-time job.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="REITH" NAMEID="WI4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr Reith</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So what were the figures last time?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Mr McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They did not ask it last time, to the best of my knowledge. But there is a very serious concern about job security. If you think the concern is not increasing, I am very pleased and I hope you continue to ignore it. The government did not address it because it does not understand it. The government sees industrial relations exclusively as an economic issue. It misses the whole social aspect of industrial relations arrangements. The same person whom the government wants to work a 12-hour shift is the person who is worried about whether they are going to have time with their children and who outside working hours is actively involved in the community. But when you are working a 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. shift, there is not a lot of time to be with your kids; there is not a lot of time to be involved in community organisations. These important social organisations that keep our society ticking over have depended, for the last 50 years and more, on people having time to be involved in them after they finish work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the government's response to this growing concern about job security? It is shown in every empirical study and given in every anecdote and discussion you have with people in every workplace that Australians are 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7529"> increasingly concerned about their jobs and their job security. The government, when it does not ignore it, makes it worse. The introduction of individual contracts, which make it easier to make changes to the working conditions that influence this concern over job security, and the overall pressure for deregulation of the labour market are leading to some changes that are exacerbating this very real and substantial Australian problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The market gives incentives to employers to employ their workers for longer hours rather than to employ new people. We are seeing either cashing out of overtime or slashing of the rates. We are seeing penalty rates for antisocial hours disappear. Sometimes these are very unfair; sometimes they are not. Sometimes it is a decent outcome for those individuals working with a decent employer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what about all those people who are not parties to the contract and who would desperately like to get some part of that extra work that is being generated? This is an issue that we need to begin to address, but this government is consistently making it worse. There are hundreds of thousands of Australians seriously concerned about this. They do not appreciate the fact that the minister who is supposed to be doing something about it thinks it is funny. They think it is an increasingly serious problem. There are lots of people working part time who want more work; of course, there are the unemployed who want work; and there is an increasing  proportion of people in work who would like to be working fewer hours. That is what the evidence says. It continues to say that the distribution of work is getting more unfair in our society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's changes make it very clear: the system does not protect those people any more. The government wants more and more people to work 12-hour shifts. It is removing the fundamental protections that have protected and enhanced the working conditions of Australians for generations. The Industrial Relations Commission, the award system and the capacity effectively to pursue the improvement of your living standards 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> through collective action&mdash;all of those things are being undermined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government decides it will add to this: they have got a new strategy to help job security; they will make it a lot easier for you to get the sack. This does not seem to me fundamentally to go to the concern that ordinary Australians have about the security of their jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have is Australians working harder and for less. And for what? Where is the social benefit? We have not seen any upsurge in employment as a consequence. We have not seen any fundamental change in the relationship between growth and jobs. We have got growth declining. One of the substantial reasons for this is the insecurity that the government is creating. It might not be in the economics textbook but it ought to be obvious to anybody. If it was not obvious before now, yesterday's housing figures and the response by Ron Silberberg from the Housing Industry Association, who is not renowned as one of our most ardent supporters, made it clear. The issue of insecurity in Australian households is what is holding back the housing sector. It is the reason why the benefits from the cuts in interest rates are not flowing into increased activity and jobs in the housing sector, just as the same problem is permeating the retail sector and other industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So let us have a look at the picture. This government has been in government for about 18 months now. They are about halfway through their term. We have some chance to start to measure their performance. In industrial relations, what do we see? We see the number of strikes going up. So what does the government do? It has plans for industrial war but no plans for industrial peace. We see wages rising more slowly, or even falling, but the government is putting on pressure for them to go down and not up. When figures come out, you sometimes hear the minister saying, `I am worried that the rate of increase is too high,' but I have never seen him express a concern that they might be too low. All the pressure is to put them down and not up.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7530">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We see the outcomes of the distribution of work and wages becoming less and less fair and the government introducing policies to make it worse and not better. We see the job growth stagnant and the government slashing confidence and flattening the economy. We see rising stress and insecurity in the workplace and the government increasing the pressure on workers and reducing their protection. The government is consistently showing a pattern of ignoring this issue, which goes to the very heart of the social concerns of Australian workers and the households in which they live.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If that litany of failure in the area of strikes, jobs, wages, fairness and confidence is a benchmark of this government's view that its industrial relations policies have been a success, I would hate to see what would be the benchmark for a failure. If they think more strikes, lower wages, falling jobs, increasing stress and insecurity are success, I would hate to see what constituted failure. Working Australians and their families and all those who aspire to work&mdash;if only they get half a chance&mdash;deserve much better than this.</PARA></SPEECH>

I was left virtually without a response when the shadow minister, the member for Canberra, (Mr McMullan) said, `Let's be empirical,' and then rattled off a series of facts and figures which are patently  and obviously wrong. For example, he said, `Growth is declining.' Didn't you see the annual report of the Reserve Bank and yesterday's comments by the Reserve Bank Governor, who said that growth in 1996&hyphen;97 would be just a bit under three per cent?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You said something about the number of strikes. Don't you bother to inform yourself of the statistics? The number of industrial 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> disputes in Australia was more than two&hyphen;thirds lower in 1996 than it was 10 years previously. It was the lowest number recorded in over 50 years. They are official Australian Bureau of Statistics figures, which give a lie to some of the shadow minister's claims. He even said, `Wages are falling,' and then read out a series of numbers which actually demonstrated that people have been getting wage increases, not wage decreases. It is quite an incredible performance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then he bemoaned the circumstances of people who are on relatively low incomes. So he should bemoan them, because no government did more to disadvantage low income earners than the Hawke-Keating government, of which this minister was a member.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Then I get the interjection, `When did you support wage increases?' Let me answer that question. We have just supported a wage increase. To your eternal embarrassment, we came into office and we said that, for those people who are on low incomes, we would make sure there was a fair deal for them. Not only did we make that promise before the election but, firstly, we legislated the rock solid guarantees that we gave before the election and, furthermore, we went down to the Industrial Relations Commission and we argued the case that these people on low incomes should be fairly treated and, lastly, the commission gave a $10 safety net wage increase. This would have to be one of the best outcomes for people on low incomes in recent history.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under our system, they got a $10 a week wage increase. When this matter was last before the commission, what did they get under your government? They got $8 under your government. What did they get under our government? They got $10. What was the value of that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank you for presenting this matter of public importance because, when you look at the real value of recent safety net increases and take C14 as an example, you see that  after an increase they were up $359.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the reality. You can have all the rhetoric you like about real wages for people who are on low incomes, but this government made commitments and legislated those commitments. We have seen those commitments in people's pockets. That is the most complete and comprehensive answer you could get.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me pick up one other thing the shadow minister said. He said we had not kept that promise. I find that very interesting because one of your criticisms relates to the agreement making process. Under the agreement making process that we have, if you enter into an agreement, it will be approved by the relevant authority&mdash;the Industrial Relations Commission or the Office of the Employment Advocate&mdash;provided it meets a test. That test is that the sum total of all the benefits of a particular award must be matched by the agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given that all the guarantees that you gave people when you were in office about their being reasonably looked after were summed up in the no-disadvantage test and given that we have the same test, how can you as a matter of logic then attack the very proposition that we have implemented?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only attack that you have been able to make is the attack you have made on the Office of the Employment Advocate.

The reality is&mdash;and you have got nowhere to go on this&mdash;that we kept your no-disadvantage test. We made it a bit more flexible, but the concept is the same.

It just shows that you have not even bothered to get out the latest international evidence on this issue. How pathetic! Then you get the AWIRS. You did not mention the Australian Workplace Industrial Relations survey of the last few days. In fact, 63 per cent reported job satisfaction&mdash;and that was before we got in, so I reckon that figure would be up since then&mdash;and 75 per cent were happy with their hours. That was under your rotten system when people did not have a say.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality on wages is that we have delivered what we have said. In a sense we have delivered more than what we said. I tell you what: at $10 we delivered a lot more than your $8. What an embarrassment it was when the commission said of your proposal that it would lead to higher unemployment. That is what it said. When it comes to job insecurity, the fact of the matter is that Australia, compared to the rest of the world, does very well. That is not to say that there are not issues that need to be addressed, but the way to address those issues is to empower people to have a greater say. Of course, you are opposed to that because the people you want to have a  greater say are the people up there at the ACTU congress. That is your problem and that is why we reject the MPI. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JK6">Mr McCLELLAND</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not in the minute yet. That AWIR survey said that slack 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> demand rather than minimum wage levels appeared to be the main constraint on small business hiring. But, to collect my $30 from the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith), I refer to the example of the application by the transport workers for an across-the-board industry increase of 10 per cent which was opposed by the government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the period of the previous government there were numerous increases of between 10 and 15 per cent&mdash;in the oil industry, the mining industry, the building industry and the communications industry. The fallacy of the government's industrial relations policy is that in those specialist industries where there are high levels of skill and they are still prospering&mdash;the government has literally ripped open the shirts of the employers and exposed their solar plexus, probably lower down than the solar plexus in fact&mdash;they have taken the role of the umpire out of the equation and those employers are going to find that they will suffer from the assault that they are going to get because of the government exposing them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the reality for most workers is that they are suffering stress and anxiety and it is now a major impediment to economic growth. I have referred to the AWIR survey which shows that slack demand rather than minimum wages is the main concern of small business, and that slack demand is the result of job insecurity. Job insecurity is now twofold. It is a question not only of holding on to a job but also of wages and terms and conditions of employment. Eighteen months after 1 January all but the 20 core conditions contained in section 89A of the act are going to evaporate. Overnight all conditions will go. Hard won conditions since the 1890s will go overnight.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They have been indeed won in a series of contests and negotiations since the 1890s. They have gone overnight under this government. If the workers want to attempt to restore their terms and conditions, they can only go to the those 20 core conditions under section 89A.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7534">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where do we find, under those 20 core conditions, anything resembling the termination, change and redundancy provisions which were contained in those famous test cases in the early 1980s? They are nowhere to be found. Employers do not have an obligation to give notice to workers about intended changes, whether those changes be in respect of the introduction of technology or in respect of the changing of manning level or in respect of outsourcing of work, which is an increasing phenomenon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is absolutely no obligation to give notice and, of course, as a corollary to that, there is no obligation to consult in any way, shape or form with workers. Workers are totally exposed. This government has introduced unfettered and unrestrained managerial prerogative, despite the advances that were taking place in terms of a sophisticated industrial relations framework where workers were increasingly having a say in their own destiny&mdash;and to the ultimate productivity gains of the employers, I might say.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Workers on basic conditions wanting to progress their wage rates&mdash;and this relates to the bet by the minister&mdash;are now left, in section 89A(3), with an inability of the commission to award anything other than a minimum wage rate. The commission cannot make an award or order for an actual pay increase. They are left to award virtually poverty level wages with the $380 minimum wage rate. If workers want to improve on that minimum rate, they are forced into an enterprise bargaining situation. There is no longer any obligation to bargain in good faith. The employer is under no obligation to disclose, for instance, their profit level. The employer is under no obligation to disclose the salary levels of their chief executives. The employer is under no obligation to display what their proposed manning level changes are going to  be. Workers are going in cold. All those enterprise bargaining in good faith provisions have gone. They exist right around the world in just about all European countries and in North America. Indeed, they existed in South Africa under the former apartheid regime. But we have not got those. They have gone.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Workers are left very much on their own in terms of enterprise bargaining. They are a victim to the market power of the employer. When there is a restriction or a hiccup in the bargaining process, what happens? What happens is what we are seeing at Rio Tinto. The commission has no power to arbitrate under section 170N; that has been taken away. The employer is also a victim in those circumstances where the reverse of the coin applies and unions, in the specific circumstances of the industry, retain industrial power. The government has removed the ability of the umpire to adjudicate in such enterprise bargaining situations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the ability of the employer to undermine conditions, there is no obligation on an employer to bargain collectively. The employers are trying to go behind the backs of unions and pick off workers one at a time, like the Tarzan movies where the villains come in and pick the last ones off along the trail. The employers are able to do that by going behind the collective bargaining process and picking off employees. One example that I confronted was of employers inducing workers to sign individual contracts by offering them a free dinner. They were being as fickle as that to pick off workers. They have completely and utterly undermined the enterprise bargaining process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the ability of workers to retain their conditions, there is no longer any power of the commission under section 89A to make an award or an order regarding contracting out. There are High Court cases which say that that is clearly a legitimate industrial issue, because if an employer can avoid or get around terms and conditions of employment by contracting out to a contractor who is going to undercut wages and conditions, quite clearly living standards are going to be affected. That has all been removed. The commission's role as a legitimate umpire or referee to ensure and protect workers' terms and conditions has been completely and utterly obliterated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had worldwide respect for our system of industrial relations because it was one where the law of the jungle did not apply. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7535"> It was one where the commission had the power to be an umpire. If one reads the constitution debates leading up to the then Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904, one will see that that motive existed as a result of the tremendous damage done by the disputation, which is going to be rife in those sectors where there is still industrial strength. As to whether this changed environment is necessary, in commenting on the Australian Workplace Industrial Relations Survey, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some 83 per cent of small businesses said they were satisfied with present arrangements for determining pay and conditions; just 7 per cent were dissatisfied. Some 76 per cent of small businesses agreed with the statement that "management thinks the award system has worked well in the past"; while only 9 disagreed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This government has introduced unnecessary draconian provisions which constitute an unprecedented assault on hard won terms and conditions and has created insecurity of such proportions that the economic development of this nation is being impeded.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Obviously the member for Barton (Mr McClelland) has lost the bet. The Howard government provided a $10 safety net, unlike the Labor government. So the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith), who is at the table, would be delighted to receive the $30 because he would like to contribute that to the `Save Bill Ludwig Fund' in Queensland during the factional warfare in that state. Let us compare the `better pay for better work' under the present Howard government with the performance of the former Labor government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the coal industry. We see a very interesting article here entitled, `Coal Miners on notice'. In that article the general manager of Rio Tinto points out some of the outrageous practices in the coal industry that were encouraged and abetted by the Labor 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Party during their time in power. Mr Clifford points out that the industry will not be able to survive unless there are changes in the work practices and the industrial relations activities of the Rio Tinto company and the union movement.

Australia needs to improve its productivity and efficiency and at the Rio Tinto No. 1 mine&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="FITZGIBBON" NAMEID="8K6">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8K6">Mr Fitzgibbon</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You support Rio Tinto, do you?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VH4">Mr McARTHUR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for Hunter would understand that. You have been there, you understand what goes on and you support it, and your government supported those practices. What happened there was that work was allocated to individuals disregarding their ability to do the job, disregarding whether management wanted to make some change to the work teams. The unions said that workers would do exactly what they instructed to do. There was no recognition of merit; there was no desire to improve workplace arrangements to improve productivity because of the stranglehold the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union had over the workplace.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was a closed shop in the Rio Tinto No. 1 mine; everyone in Australia knows that. Work was allocated according to seniority. New employees could work only a night shift; that was an unpopular shift. But of course the union said that new employees would work at that time. The lowest paid worker received only $55,000 per annum&mdash;only $55,OOO and their wage rates went up to $70,000 and $80,000. Industrial action in this coal industry, under the arrangements put in place by the former government, is 45 times the national average. There is a last on, first off seniority system for hiring and firing, as well as compulsory engagements from union lists. So if you were in the union and were put off, you were put on again. There was no ability to find new employees, new blood, with new outlooks.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7536">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Hunter Valley No. 1 mine, as the honourable member would understand, only returns two per cent on investment. It is a financial disaster, largely brought about because of the union practices of the former government. In 1996, the Hunter Valley No. 1 mine experienced 24&hyphen;hour stoppages on no fewer than 14 occasions. That is double the coal industry average and 100 times the average for all industries. In 1996, the working days lost per thousand employees for all industries was 131 days. Listen to this figure. For Rio Tinto No. 1 mine, 12,800 working days were lost. That is the comparison under the Labor Party regime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first stoppages this year took place in relation to the dismissal of an employee for misconduct. They had a strike at the mine because one guy was sacked. When the company refused to reverse its decision there was a further 24&hyphen;hour strike. How does the member opposite defend that? The matter was referred to the Industrial Relations Commission for arbitration. When the IRC found in favour of the company that resulted in yet another strike because they were not happy to receive the umpire's decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were more union stoppages for the Parliament House rally&mdash;that rally that members well recall at the front of Parliament House. The union insisted that 10 per cent of the work force be given time off to attend the protest. When this was refused they had a two&hyphen;day strike to reinforce their position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Hunter Valley workers also took industrial action in sympathy with employees at the Vickery coal mine. What was the background for that strike? There was a four&hyphen;day stoppage in protest to proposed changes to workers compensation laws. So it goes on. When the company refused to ban a contractor who had done some work for the company during the stoppage there was a 24&hyphen;hour strike. They would not agree to any management instructions or the rulings of the Industrial Relations Commission or the courts of law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last night at Parliament House, Mr Graeme Watson of the law firm Freehill, Hollingdale and Page addressed the Society of Modest Members, which is a free thinking group of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the coalition. He discussed the provisions of the new Workplace Relations Act which have provided Rio Tinto with legal provisions to improve the work practices in the Hunter Valley No. 1 coal mine, to keep the mine open, to keep it working and to keep jobs in that area. It was under the new powers under section 127 of the Workplace Relations Act that Rio Tinto was able to seek an order preventing further industrial action and to get an order to get people to return to work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Reith legislation is able to bring about a new attitude in the coal mine at Rio Tinto. The freedom of association provisions&mdash;that is, whether or not you join a union&mdash;are now being enforced under the new Reith legislation. The secondary boycott provisions of the Trade Practices Act have prevented strikes from escalating to national stoppages. The legislation eventually encouraged those train drivers to cross the picket line and deliver the coal to the port&mdash;something that would not have happened under the previous Labor government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You know that as well as I do. The new industrial relations policy, the Reith legislation, has provided a cooperative environment where we allow employers and employees to bargain free of union interference and has ensured that irresponsible strike action can be prevented. The figures on what has happened at this mine are horrendous, as you understand. You know that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to do a comparison with the situation under the Labor Party's preferred option. If we look at the Rio Tinto No. 1 mine in the Hunter Valley, there are some very intrinsic advantages in terms of the quality of the coal and the overburden. We get one tonne of coal for every 2&half; tonnes of overburden. That is a very important statistic which allows that mine to be profitable. You would think that that would be one of the best mines in Australia. The ratio of those figures is important. That is a union dominated mine where there have been a number of strikes which I have recorded. It was a first off first on attitude so nobody knew that employees 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7537"> could be replaced and also replaced from the union list.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us make a comparison with Queensland. We have the Ensham mine at Emerald in Queensland. They have 12 tonnes of rubble to one tonne of coal&mdash;a very difficult technical task. They decided to make a fundamental change to the industrial relations approach under the Reith legislation. The CFMEU of course wanted to fight that. One of the fundamental changes was the introduction of a 12&hyphen;hour shift. Thirty workers went on to the new contracts. The shift rosters ensured a new arrangement: 84 hours a week, seven days a week at the mine and seven days off. The workers wanted this change. It provided more leisure time for them in their week off back home. Mr Ken Foots, who is managing the mine, is reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Foots told the Australian Industrial Relations  Commission earlier this year that the 12&hyphen;hour shifts have been the key contributor to Ensham's productivity. Elsewhere in the Bowen Basin, open&hyphen;cut mines operating on eight-hour shift rosters only achieve 5.5 per productive hours work a day because of meal breaks, crib breaks, demarcation and the extra time it takes to change over the three shifts, he said. "The Ensham roster, combined with no demarcation, enables us to achieve 23.5 hours of productive work per day on a particular piece of equipment," he said, "an improvement of more than 40 per cent in utilisation."</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That particular change was supported by no less than Mr Graham Gosling, the National Secretary of the Communication, Electrical and Plumbing Union. He is one of your lot. He said that the changes have been very helpful. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The general view held by our members is that the working conditions, both in terms of the flexibility and the amount of time worked, you wouldn't take them off with a cannon . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is what he said they were so pleased with these changes. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On my experience there is certainly a high level of employee democracy there.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Foots went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the mine is now a high&hyphen;trust workplace with few managers, where employees virtually run the show. </PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We have a situation where, under the Reith legislation, we have people being employed 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> on merit, we have the task allocated to those employees who have the skills to do the job rather than the union dominated arrangements and we have employees being consulted by management to get the job done.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZT4">Mr SOMLYAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;This report reviews the audit reports of the Auditor-General which were tabled in the second quarter of 1996-97. Three of those audit reports were selected by the JCPA to be examined at public hearings which were held on 3 February. These were Audit Report No. 13, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tax Debt Collection</EMPHASIS> ; Audit Report No. 15, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Food Provisioning in the Defence Force</EMPHASIS> ; and Audit Report No. 17, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Work Force Planning in the Australian Defence Force</EMPHASIS> .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The JCPA's report does not attempt to analyse in detail all of the audit findings and recommendations in those three reports. Instead, it draws attention to key issues 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7538"> discussed at the hearings and highlights commitments given by witnesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The audit on tax debt collection was a constructive exercise which resulted in a number of sensible and useful recommendations, all of which were accepted by the Australian Taxation Office. An audit office analysis indicated that a combination of minor improvements to the timeliness of debt collection and the effectiveness of recovery level would result in potentially significant net ongoing benefits to the Commonwealth. The audit report estimated that even a modest improvement would provide a net benefit to the Commonwealth of about $142 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The JCPA's review of the debt collection report highlighted three issues of concern. Firstly, there is a risk that penalties for late payments of tax are not being administered by the Taxation Office in accordance with the law. The legislation requires that additional charges be automatically imposed when a tax debt is paid late. An assessment by the audit office showed that 35 per cent of the outstanding debt cases finalised by payment in 1995-96 had no ATLP&mdash;late payment&mdash;imposed. The results of this assessment were supported by the findings of an internal tax office audit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, it is a fact that taxpayers with large tax debts are more likely to have late payment penalties remitted than taxpayers with small debts. The audit report noted the risk that penalties may be being used as a negotiating tool in debt collection. The JCPA considers that both practices are wrong and represent an unacceptable risk to revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, the JCPA has a concern that too often litigation is pursued when negotiation would produce better results. It appears that good central tax office policy is not always matched by good regional office policy. A number of my colleagues have reported to me that regional tax officers were totally unaware of the thrust of the ATO's policy. From my own experience, my colleagues are right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The JCPA made suggestions and recommendations to improve the tax office performance in all of these areas. The JCPA looks forward to the ATO addressing these criti cisms seriously and with urgency. Whether 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the response from the ATO is satisfactory will determine if the JCPA needs to conduct further inquiries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The JCPA's review of food provisioning in the Defence Force again highlighted significant shortcomings in the ability of Defence's financial management systems to generate accurate information on the total costs of Defence activities. Defence was unable to provide the total cost of providing rations to Defence Force personnel to the audit office or at the hearing and took some time to construct an estimate of cost after the event. Defence's estimate of total cost of provisioning was $277 million per annum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The lack of ready access to such information makes it extremely difficult for Defence to manage its resources efficiently and to account adequately for its expenditure and performance. It is clear that much remains to be done in Defence to reform financial management systems and practices. Financial management reforms need to be a clear priority for Defence, as it prepares itself for the Commonwealth's new accrual budgeting environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As noted in the audit report and at the hearing, the fundamental flaw in food provisioning is the absence of a clear ADF&hyphen;wide policy on food provisioning. The audit office highlighted the resulting risk that procedures on food provisioning are not aligned to Defence Force objectives and may not be cost effective or best practice. The Defence Force has acknowledged the deficiency, and the JCPA has been advised by Defence that a policy will be in place by the end of the year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third and final report that the JCPA examined in this report was work force planning in the ADF. Work force planning is an issue of central importance to the quality and preparedness of the Defence Force. It is also an issue of great complexity. The audit report attempted to assess the work force planning systems used by the Defence Force with a view to identifying better practice and making recommendations to promote the overall effectiveness of planning systems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the main challenges identified during the review was a need to devolve a greater degree of management responsibilities 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7539"> from Defence Force headquarters to individual Defence managers. Although a balance needs to be maintained when devolving responsibilities in an environment that has a demand for strong, central controls, the committee considers that the advantages to be gained from increased management flexibility are quite significant. It is a balance which, if achieved, could help overcome many of the rigidities and inefficiencies in Defence's work force planning systems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, it is clear to the committee that Defence faces some fundamental work force planning problems. The committee accepts that the personnel managers require better tools and levers for managing the strength of the service than are currently used and notes the efforts currently being made in Defence to address a number of work force planning issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude by thanking those people who contributed their time and expertise to the committee's review. I wish to thank members of the sectional committee for their participation in this most effective round&hyphen;table process of examining reports of the Auditor-General. The work done by the JCPA staff cannot be overstated. They continue to perform to the high standards the parliament has come to expect. In particular, I wish to thank Jennifer Hughson for another report of the highest standard and quality. I commend report 352 to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA STYLE="Para">The reason I move this motion is essentially to set in place a guillotine so that these particular items are dealt with today. The blue shows that these matters were intended to be dealt with today. Clearly these are important matters from the point of view of the Commonwealth and in respect of Common 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> wealth&hyphen;state relations. Members of the House will appreciate that recently the High Court brought down a decision which invalidated certain state laws, which thereby undermined the capacity of state governments to raise certain necessary revenues for the running of those state governments. These nine bills are therefore obviously urgent. It is necessary that they go through this chamber to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am surprised that the opposition would today be insisting on measures which would make it more difficult for the government to put these measures through. In fact, I understood that the opposition was attempting to cooperate with the passage of this legislation, which is clearly not the case. Who is running your fiscal policy over there? Who is running it? The fact of the matter is this is a matter of national priority. You people are playing childish, juvenile stupid games. It is amazing, Mr Deputy Speaker.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just so it is on the record, we have these matters before the chamber today. There are 10 speakers in all&mdash;four opposition, a couple of Independents and four government. In the normal course of events, with people's sensible cooperation, these bills could be dealt with without any particular difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members of the House will understand that in the Senate recently there was a debate on an entirely separate matter, namely, the future policy in respect of the textiles, clothing and footwear industries. The Senate has a view about that. They passed a resolution.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I said, `If the opposition is not prepared to give us cooperation in the management of the House, then obviously we are not prepared to give time today to the Leader of the Opposition on his bill.' I do not mind if the Leader of the Opposition wishes to introduce it at some other time. But, given those opposite have told me to my face that they are going to do everything they can to delay the passage of these important bills, obviously I am not going to bend over backwards to provide additional time to the opposition. However, I have no objection to the Leader of the Opposition introducing his bill at some other time. We agreed yesterday, at 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7547"> their request, to change it. If he wants to move that bill at some stage, that is fine. I do not have an argument about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I do have an argument about is that the opposition is not entitled to hold a gun at the head of the government and require of us that we hold a vote on a matter of their choosing. When you say it, it just shows you how absolutely absurd this proposition is. Never in 13 years when we were in opposition was such a proposition ever put. Never would we have had the gall, the hypocrisy, the impertinence or the arrogance to have lost an election and then demand that we should run the agenda. Well, you do not run the agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am a bit disappointed because I thought last week that your more feral characteristics had left you in the winter recess and the reds of Bordeaux had tempered your normally far too excitable nature. Too early did I hope for a more sensible approach from you. That is why we have moved the suspension of standing orders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is regrettable that we have had no cooperation from the opposition. You leave us absolutely no choice&mdash;given that you have signalled that you will do all that you can to prevent it&mdash;because, of course, we are going to have this legislation through today. I commend the motion to the House. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We, of course, oppose this proposal to guillotine a package of tax legislation. The Leader of the House (Mr Reith) has got the hide of a rhinoceros and Pinocchio's nose. I have never heard such an appalling explanation for this mess that we find ourselves in because of the mismanagement of the Leader of the House. We have before us now a proposition to guillotine through what we had agreed to put through. We had even agreed to cut our speakers back by 15 minutes to get this proposition through.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what did we get today? We got the ratting on a deal by the Leader of the House. This was the deal: we all know the tragic circumstances of yesterday in which the world was mourning the loss of Diana; we had an understanding with the government that, if 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> they wanted it to be a low-key day, we would cooperate. On that basis, because the private member's bill that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) wants to move happens to relate to a plebiscite on whether we move to a republic&mdash;it just might have been a bit sensitive on the day that the monarchy lost one of its favourites&mdash;we offered to pull it off yesterday, when it was slotted in, on the basis that we were guaranteed a time slot today. That was the deal. No ifs, no buts, that was the deal. That is what you have ratted on; and that is why you have this lack of cooperation from us now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The second point is that, had the government stuck with the deal, the Leader of the Opposition would have introduced this bill at a quarter to five today and would have been required to have concluded it at 10 to five&mdash;50 minutes ago. So we would have been at least into the third speaker on this so-called set of taxation legislation for which you say you now need a guillotine. What incompetence, what foolishness, what stupidity and what an inability to manage the affairs of the House!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You might think you are a player in the leadership stakes&mdash;and, maybe you are, with the other incompetents that are on your side&mdash;but your function in this case is to manage government business, and all you are doing is delaying it. You are delaying it by your stupidity, by your arrogance and by your nonpreparedness to cooperate. We have given this government absolute cooperation in the way in which legislation has gone through&mdash;we have even had the Leader of the House thank us for doing so&mdash;because we do recognise that the government has got a mandate to get its legislation through. But the government does not have a mandate to rat on deals. The important thing for a politician is that their word is their bond. That is their currency. Once one debases that currency, one is worthless as a politician. And that is your position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, more importantly, you are required to manage the affairs of the House. You are now in the position where to get this legislation through, which we had promised to get through for you, you have to guillotine it. You will get no other cooperation from us

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. We all know that, in essence, most people understood that the High Court was going to make a decision of the type it made and that the states in particular had been prepared for it, as had, I would imagine, the Commonwealth government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make the observation that a number of us who represent our constituencies want to make a contribution in relation to the interests of our constituents&mdash;no party interest involved&mdash;and, therefore, whatever sort of deal has been arranged between the opposition and the government is mostly irrelevant. What we are interested in is finding out what exactly is in the best interests of our constituents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given that we have a cognate debate on nine separate bills and that you are now in the process of applying the guillotine to them, I consider that to be a gross infringement on the opportunity for members to make a contribution on behalf of their constituents.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, but you know very well what I am talking about. By making that sort of interjection and some of the silly comments 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> you made in your speech, you give good cause for people to become exasperated with this process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why would you bother? You do not even believe the debate is necessary, do you? In essence, debate to you is an unnecessary waste of time. Debate to the government and to the executive is an unnecessary waste of time before getting the legislation implemented. In actual fact the contributions of all of the people in this chamber, including the government members, are irrelevant because all the government is interested in is getting its legislation rammed through the legislature, through both houses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is little wonder why people feel cut off and divorced from the process when they can see their own representatives sitting almost impotent when involved in a serious set of legislative debates, as we are to be involved with this afternoon and this evening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The  Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997 [No. 2]  is another important bill. At least two members of the government have indicated that they intend to cross the floor. I, for one, would be very interested in hearing their contributions. We know that the member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) and the member for Dawson (Mrs De&hyphen;Anne Kelly) have both indicated their serious concerns with this bill. I, for one, as a member involved in listening to debate would like to know exactly what is causing these troubles. I would like to hear in depth the reasons for the positions that they have taken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In essence, we are being asked with this guillotine motion to cut back the time for debate on a very important set of bills. As a member of this place, I want to indicate my opposition to the motion. I am very disappointed that the government has chosen to move such a motion at this early stage in the spring sitting.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">I move this motion so that those members who had indicated their intention to speak on these bills will have some opportunity to do so. Members should be aware that the only reason that this guillotine motion has been moved today is that the opposition advised that, unless we had a debate and a motion and a vote on the TCF matter, they would not allow us to obtain passage of the tax bills&mdash;which is one of the more absurd and feral and stupid things that they have done in the time that they have been in opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday the opposition said that they felt that it was an inappropriate time for the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) to move a motion introducing his republic plebiscite bill, so we said that we were happy to have it moved today. We were happy to have it moved today, but when the opposition takes the view that they are going to do all in their power to prevent the passage of the tax bills, which forces us to the guillotine motion, obviously we are not going then to say, `Not only will we allow you to waste our time, we will give you more time simply at your beck and call.' This is one of the more absurd and extreme cases of the opposition being unprepared to sensibly manage the business of the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not and have not moved guillotine motions, except in the most onerous circumstances. These nine bills are obviously important. Maybe members of the opposition have failed to notice a recent High Court decision. Maybe they are of the opinion that we can just let time go by. If we were to play your silly games, you would not have us ringing you; you would have Bob Carr ringing to complain that you, by your absurd and juvenile tactics, were preventing the sensible passage of important legislation to undermine the revenue of the state of New South Wales.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had fine entertainment this afternoon. The Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Crean) has accused the government of the most dastardly motives. I have been called a rat, I have been called incompetent, I have been called all my favourite nicknames. I have been called everything under the sun. I must say that we enjoy the banter, we enjoy the to and fro. We enjoy seeing the struggle of opposition. What those opposite have to understand is that in March 1996, the Australian people went to the polls and voted for the coalition to manage the affairs of this country. When they so voted, they invited us to manage the affairs of the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have the Manager of Opposition Business on a long leash. Today he is struggling and straining a bit. Ultimately, it is the government that determines the program and management of business in the House. We will therefore determine that today we will do the tax bills which need to be done. I commend this final motion to the House. With a bit of luck, this will be the last one for the day.</PARA></SPEECH>

The second element of what the opposition is proposing is that there was a deal done with the Leader of the House whereby the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley)&mdash;not a backbencher, not a frontbencher&mdash;could come forward and in five minutes put forward a private member's bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot recall&mdash;certainly not in my tenure in the seat that you now occupy, Mr Deputy Speaker Hollis&mdash;an occasion when a Leader of the Opposition was denied an opportunity to bring a private member's bill before the House. As the member for Hotham has already outlined, the deal was done because of the circumstances of yesterday. It was considered inappropriate that a bill dealing with referendums and  constitutional change with respect to a republic should come forward on such a day. We agreed. The Leader of the Opposition agreed to come in today and put his private member's bill before the House. The member for Flinders, the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, agreed to that. He said that that deal would be done&mdash;it was a core deal&mdash;and that the Leader of the Opposition could come in here today and present his bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now he has turned around and it is not a core deal anymore. It is not even a non&hyphen;core deal. There is no deal. It is a deal that the Leader of the House can quite obviously rat on with no afterthought, no compassion&mdash;</PARA>

The deal had been done&mdash;a five&hyphen;minute contribution by the Leader of the Opposition and then we would go on to this legislation. You wanted it through tonight.

This is only the second week in this sitting of parliament. We have another six weeks to go and you are putting guillotine motions on. Is this what the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) meant when he said he was going to improve standards in the parliament? You have to be kidding. The Leader of the House should know better.

The issue causing conflict between the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) and the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Crean) is not whether or not the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) could put before this House his bill on a plebiscite for a referendum on a republic but that the Manager of Opposition Business also wanted a debate and a vote on TCF tariffs which, of course, is an issue still in the hands of the Productivity Commission.

You want to try to convince your own constituency that you did not let them down with your tariff policies. Why did you introduce tariff cuts? You did it because you did not have the courage to confront your bosses in the ACTU and bring in some sensible labour reform that might have allowed employers and employees to combine to save their jobs and protect Australian industry in a truly competitive way.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a great pity that we have spent two hours getting to this point because we could have had an adequate debate on this legislation as well as on other important matters to do with textiles, clothing and footwear and the private member's bill of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) concerning the republic.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The House is considering a very complex and important series of bills in this debate. They are the Sales Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 1997, the Sales Tax (Customs) (Alcoholic Beverages) Bill 1997, the Sales Tax (Excise) (Alcoholic Beverages) Bill 1997, the Sales Tax (General) (Alcoholic Beverages) Bill 1997, as well as the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1997, the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1997 and three franchise fees bills&mdash;the Franchise Fees Windfall Tax (Collection) Bill 1997, the Franchise Fees Windfall Tax (Imposition) Bill 1997 and the Franchise Fees Windfall Tax (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are critical of the handling of these issues by the Commonwealth Treasurer (Mr Costello), and I will come to that a bit later. The opposition intends to take a constructive and responsible attitude to this legislation. Indeed, the government's guillotine was entirely unnecessary. We have always intended to, and still intend to, support its quick passage through this House. It is Labor's intention to support relaxation of the cut&hyphen;off rules in the Senate to allow swift consideration of this legislation in the other place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As members may be aware, this package of bills has been made necessary as a result of the High Court's decision. We are proposing to implement the temporary Commonwealth safety net taxation arrangements which were 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> announced by the Treasurer on 6 August. The need for these proposed new arrangements has arisen from the decisions in the Ha and Lim and Walter Hammond cases which were handed down by the High Court on 5 August.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those cases considered the constitutional validity of the Business Franchise Licences (Tobacco) Act 1987, a New South Wales piece of legislation, which prohibited persons, under penalty, from selling tobacco, whether by wholesale or retail, without a licence. These licences are issued on application for periods of up to one month. The licence fees, payable prior to the licence period, were $10 plus 100 per cent of the value of the tobacco sold in the month two months prior to the period of the licence. For example, the fee for the month of August 1997 was payable at the end of July 1997 and was based on sales which occurred in June 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question at issue in the cases was: does the licence fee constitute an excise for the purposes of section 90 of the Australian constitution? The first part of section 90 states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the imposition of uniform duties of customs the power of the Parliament to impose duties of customs and of excise, and to grant bounties on the production or export of goods, shall become exclusive.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The first condition of section 90&mdash;that is, the imposition of uniform duties of customs&mdash;was achieved back in 1901. From that time onwards, the Commonwealth has had the exclusive right to levy customs and excise duties. The plaintiffs in these cases claim that the New South Wales statute breached section 90. New South Wales, which, in turn, had the support of all the other states and territories, submitted that the licence fees were not duties of customs or of excise within the meaning of section 90.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The specific argument which the states put forward was that the term `duties of customs or of excise' does not cover all taxes on goods but merely duties imposed respectively on the importation or the local production or manufacture of goods. That submission sought to reopen issues which had been decided in previous cases on the basis that incorrect reasoning had been used and that that reason 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7559"> ing had then been followed in later cases. Specifically, what the states were arguing was that the extension of the definition of excise to include taxes on the distribution or the sale of goods was incorrect and that that ought to be reviewed by the High Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The High Court did agree to reopen the issues. However, four of the seven justices found for the plaintiffs and therefore against the states, thereby invalidating the New South Wales legislation and, by extension, the legislation of the other states and territories concerning licence fees for tobacco. Whilst not certain, that decision probably meant that the court would strike down the licence fees on petroleum and alcohol as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The revenue threat to the states and territories from these decisions is estimated at around $5 billion in 1997-98, which is around one-sixth of the state's own source revenue. So we are obviously talking about a lot of money here. The only options for the states were to either recoup the threatened revenue from other tax bases or request that the Commonwealth use its power under section 90 to collect the moneys, effectively as an agent for the states, and to pass on that revenue to the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the Commonwealth's temporary response, state and territory leaders unanimously requested the Commonwealth to utilise Commonwealth tax bases to collect the revenue that was formerly raised by the business franchise fees and to remit that money to the states and territories. The Commonwealth agreed to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue of the Commonwealth stepping into the breach is complicated by the fact that the states and territories have imposed their own business franchise fees on differing bases and on differing rates. That is something that the Commonwealth cannot do, of course. The constitution limits the Commonwealth to imposing identical taxes across the whole nation. As a result, compromise rates have to be struck and a complicated formula devised to equitably share the revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth has announced increases, firstly, in the level of customs and excise duties on petroleum products of 8.1c per litre; secondly, in the level of customs and excise 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> duties on tobacco of $167 per kilogram; and, thirdly, in the rates of wholesale sales tax on alcoholic beverages of 15 per cent except for low alcohol wine which will not be affected. These bills are seeking to implement the announced increases. The Commonwealth has stated that these measures will be reviewed within a six&hyphen;month period prior to permanent measures being decided upon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the area of small business, to ensure that the increase in the wholesale sales tax rates does not detrimentally affect small business, the small business exemption and the quarterly remittance regime, which both provide greater assistance to small business than the normal administrative arrangements, will be calculated with the additional tax on alcohol being excluded. The opposition's position is that these small business adjustments are appropriate, and we will be supporting them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to revenue collected, the total revenue raised is estimated to be around $6 billion. This is obviously substantially more than the lost revenue for this financial year of $5 billion.

<PARA STYLE="Para">Yet they come back to the parliament suggesting that what we need now is a GST and that this High Court decision has thrown the nation into chaos, it has thrown federal&hyphen;state relations into chaos and that the only way of fixing it is via a GST.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have here are bills that propose a great increase in Commonwealth receipts&mdash;in excess of one per cent of GDP per year&mdash;and there needs to be a full accounting of the estimates of the revenue effects of each decision. I would ask that the Treasurer or the parliamentary secretary provide details to the House of the estimated receipts flowing from each of the measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All revenue raised, less the Commonwealth's administrative costs, will be passed on to the states and territories. The opposition supports this approach as there is no justification for the Commonwealth to benefit financially from the High Court decisions. The States Grants (General Purposes) Amendment Bill 1997 was amended in this House last week, with opposition support, to facilitate the passing on of the revenue to the other jurisdictions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Identified proportions of the separate revenue streams are to be handed back to each jurisdiction. In turn, the states and territories have the responsibility of making payments back to producers and distributors to ensure that businesses and consumers are not detrimentally affected and so no windfall profits are made by the governments. It is in this final phase&mdash;the reimbursement of businesses&mdash;that the whole response to the decisions has been badly mismanaged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The High Court decisions did not come out of the blue. Everyone knew the potential gravity of the decisions and the timing of the judgments. Accordingly, there is no excuse for the chaos that reigned after the temporary Commonwealth arrangements came into 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7561"> effect. The potential for this result had been known years earlier. Indeed, the former government had considered the issue back in 1993. There is no doubt that the Treasurer should have formulated detailed contingency plans with the other jurisdictions prior to the decisions and those plans should have been capable of immediate implementation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apparently, little if anything was done beforehand, which is a damning indictment of the judgment of the Commonwealth Treasurer. The issues are apparently still not resolved. In the area of tobacco, there is the likelihood of a significant hike in the price of a packet of cigarettes in South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 27 August reports that these three conservative state governments had boycotted a recent meeting between the Commonwealth Treasury officials and industry representatives to try to sort out the confusion. What a fantastic vote of confidence that is!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The industry estimates that the new regime could result in increases in cigarette prices of between 84c and $1.75 per packet. Consumers are entitled to ask: why on earth has this happened? The Commonwealth Treasurer has assured the public that they will not be detrimentally affected, yet there may be substantial price hikes in some or all of the three commodities affected. Something has gone very wrong. That something is the lack a preparedness of the Commonwealth Treasurer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister has used the High Court decisions as a reason to introduce a GST. The opposition absolutely rejects this proposition. We believe that the botched implementation of what is a relatively minor change, compared with that if there were to be a GST introduced, is an indication of the absolute chaos that a GST would involve. We have already had the Victorian Treasurer, Alan Stockdale, reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> on 14 August as complaining that profiteering was occurring and that the liquor industry was using the High Court decisions to rip people off. If a very conservative state Treasurer is prepared to attack business in this way, it indicates that the huge changes which would be inevitable under a GST would involve  enormous costs to consumers over and above 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> those which flow automatically from the imposition of a new tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some businesses will attempt to profit from confusion. The temporary package before the House involves only three goods and involves a situation where the taxpayers are already in the system. Where the confusion affects every good and service in the economy, it is obvious that consumers are going to be vulnerable in a huge way. In addition to affecting the current and future revenue of the states and territories, the High Court decisions have opened up the possibility of past licence fee payments being reclaimed by taxpayers. This would severely damage the fiscal position of the states and territories. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth's management of this High Court decision, which they should and could have seen coming, was absolutely appalling. The states had a dreadful time trying to get the issue resolved. For example, the Queensland Premier, Rob Borbidge, wrote to Prime Minister Howard asking him to take over the negotiations on federal&hyphen;state tax reform from Mr Costello. Premier Borbidge said, `As usual, Mr Costello is not being much help. He can't help himself&mdash;it's a personality problem.' It was so serious that the Queensland Premier wrote to the Prime Minister seeking his intervention to try to get the issue resolved.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . confusion escalated about the Federal Government's plan to bail out the States after the High Court struck down $5 billion in State franchise fees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both the hotel and tobacco industries were seeking urgent meetings with the Federal Government last night about how the plan could work.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Victorian retailers were concerned about it. The National President of the Australian Hotels Association said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7562">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"There is an immediate need for the Federal Government to revisit . . . their taxation plan as State governments are utilising the new measures to increase taxation by stealth."</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">CUB said they had `reluctantly adopted the federal government directive to increase the wholesale cost of beer by 15 per cent'. They expressed concern that, unless systems were quickly in place to reimburse retailers, many would be forced out of business. Both W.D. &amp; H.O. Wills and Philip Morris suspended sales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That happened on Friday, 8 August. A few days later a Sydney crisis meeting of state officials ended in deadlock with the Premiers forced to make the kinds of remarks that Premier Borbidge made about the Treasurer. The issue was appallingly handled and it was one the federal government had plenty of time to see coming.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The situation with this legislation is such that the High Court decisions could result in past licence fee payments being reclaimed by taxpayers. This would both severely damage the fiscal position of the states and territories and provide a windfall gain to the taxpayers as the licence fees have already been passed on to consumers. To overcome what would be a manifestly unfair result, the three windfall tax bills in the package will impose a 100 per cent tax on any refunds of tobacco, alcohol or petroleum licence fees originally paid before 5 August where the refund arises because the licence fee is unconstitutional.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also the question of commercial distortions. Apart from the other issues that I have identified, this is a significant commercial issue arising from these bills. The use by the Commonwealth of the excise tax base instead of the wholesale sales tax base is expected to significantly affect the profitability of the three tobacco producers. Estimates that the opposition has received from an analysis by Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu and the Allen Consulting Group indicate that moving from an ad valorem or value based system to a weight based system of taxation for tobacco will change profits significantly for the three domestic manufacturers. Estimates in fact are that Philip Morris will lose around $5 million per annum in profits, Wills will lose over $31 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> million and Rothmans will gain around $36 million per annum. The actual effect will probably be greater now, given that the total amount of taxation being imposed on tobacco is being increased by around $500 million per annum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Treasurer acknowledged this issue in his press release of 6 August. However, the government has done nothing to ameliorate the effects of the decision. The opposition seeks an assurance from the government during this debate that the switch to excise will not result in job losses in this industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In our response to the High Court decisions, the opposition indicated that there are four principles which we need to be assured of to facilitate the passage of this legislation&mdash;the revenue package. We need to be assured that it has the agreement of the states and territories, that it fairly distributes the revenue to the states and territories, that it does not involve extra taxes being imposed on Australians and that it is equitable in its impact on the businesses immediately affected. The first two conditions have been met by the temporary Commonwealth response. We are concerned, however, that the Commonwealth has been less than competent in ensuring that consumers and businesses are not detrimentally affected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I made some remarks earlier on about the fact that the government wanted to use this High Court decision as justification for its proposal to introduce a GST. Setting aside the remarks made in the past by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer categorically ruling out a GST and saying, `We will never ever have a GST'&mdash;the Treasurer described it as snake oil&mdash;nevertheless, the opposition is now required to participate in a debate over the introduction of a GST.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our position is simple: we believe that there are fundamental equity problems with a GST and that imposing such a tax on all items of consumption is inherently regressive. The higher the GST, the more unfair it is. A flat rate GST is unfair. The situation with existing wholesale sales taxes is that luxury goods, such as furs and jewellery, are taxed at a higher rate of 32 per cent and luxury cars are taxed at 45 per cent. What the coalition wants 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7563"> to do with a GST is to introduce a single rate of tax so that the furs become cheaper while school uniforms become dearer. It is inherently regressive to have a GST and the equity problem is not capable of being solved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have a `compensation now' problem in that no-one can be guaranteed that he or she will not be worse off at the outset. You have a compensation in the future problem in that no-one can be guaranteed that he or she will not be worse off down the track. You also have massive problems for small business. This government promised small business that they would have red tape reduced by 50 per cent. Instead, with a GST, they will become unpaid tax collectors and the amount of red tape will escalate dramatically.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With wholesale sales tax, there are only around 75,000 registered tax collection points; with a GST you would have one million additional taxpayers registering and having to remit GST on a regular basis. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight in support of these franchise bills made necessary by the High Court decision on 5 August in two cases where the states' right to levy a tobacco business franchise fee was found to be invalid. Discussion of the customs and excise power has had a long history in the High Court. Contrary to what the member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson) was saying, the answer is probably to be found in the constitutional convention which has been proposed by this government and opposed by the opposition in the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly in 1901, when the Federation was first proposed, section 90 of the constitution gave the Commonwealth exclusive power over customs and excise taxes. This section has been disputed a number of times in the High Court. First was in 1904 in Peterswald v. Bartley. This was the first time the High Court examined the constitution's prohibitions on the states imposing an excise duty. In that case the High Court adopted a narrow interpretation of excise duty by deciding that licence fees imposed by states on breweries were not actually excise duties. Under that narrow interpretation, excise duty was a tax specifically on the quantity or value of goods 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> produced in the states. States could therefore apply a tax on goods which did not discriminate between goods produced within the state and goods produced outside the state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1926 was the petrol tax case, Commonwealth v. South Australia. In that case the High Court ruled that a South Australian tax of 2.5c per gallon on sellers of petrol was invalid, despite the fact that some of the petrol came from overseas, some from Victoria and some was produced within South Australia. Again, under section 90, which prohibited the states levying customs and excise duty, that was disallowed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1927 there was a newspaper case where the High Court ruled that a New South Wales tax on newspapers published and sold in that state was invalid on the grounds that it was an excise duty. In 1938, in Matthews v. Chicory Marketing Board, the High Court ruled that a levy of $2 per half acre on land planted with chicory was invalid. In 1949, in Parton v. Milk Board (Vic), a levy of 0.1c per gallon imposed by the Victorian Milk Board on sellers of milk who were not the original producers was declared to be an excise and therefore invalid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Gradually over time you can see that the definition of excise was expanded to not just the production of goods but every stage of the distribution as well. Then in 1958, in Dennis Hotels v. Victoria, the High Court ruled that the temporary licence fee based on sales during a permit's duration was invalid. But they did allow a slight loophole, if you like, in that the annual licence fee based on sales during the previous 12 months was held not to be an excise fee and therefore was held to be valid. A number of cases, including State of Western Australia v. Chamberlain Industries Pty Ltd and Dickenson's Arcade Pty Ltd v. Tasmania, followed that. In the Dickenson's Arcade case, the High Court upheld tobacco franchise fees, as it had upheld the liquor franchise fees in the Dennis Hotels case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, we come to the case of Ha and Hammond v. NSW, the decision that was handed down on 5 August from the High Court. In this case they went back and reassessed the Dennis Hotels case. They found the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7564"> licence fee, which includes a set amount plus an amount calculated by reference to the value of tobacco sold during the relevant period&mdash;and `relevant period' was defined as the month commencing two months before the commencement of the period in which the licence expires&mdash;to actually be an excise and therefore invalid. In the majority decision, their Honours stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Duties of excise are taxes on the production, manufacture, sale or distribution of goods, whether of foreign or domestic origin. Duties of excise are inland taxes in contradistinction from duties of customs which are taxes on the importation of goods. Both are taxes on goods, that is to say, they are taxes on some step taken in dealing with goods.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This decision has severely hampered the ability of the states to raise funds. An enormous amount of the states' revenue did come from what have now been defined as excise duties which for a number of years states imposed. It raises the problem of whether states that have previously imposed taxes in this fashion may be&mdash;quite validly&mdash;requested to refund those funds to the franchisees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The development of federation is interesting in that the situation we have today requires a constitutional convention. It really is not so much a discussion about whether we will have an Australian head of state or not but a discussion on such things as section 52, the powers which were given to the Commonwealth. Richard Court, in his paper `Rebuilding the Federation', is certainly opposed to any further attachment of powers to the Commonwealth over and above what was given to them in federation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that that has not happened. Since World War II, the High Court has consistently expanded the Commonwealth's powers. With the Fraser Island mining case, the Franklin Dam and now Mabo, the powers of the Commonwealth have expanded, and the definitions in the constitution have certainly brought a lot of things to bear within the Commonwealth's legislative jurisdiction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One key element underlying our constitution is the separation of powers&mdash;judicial power, legislative power and executive power. It is something that anyone attending this constitutional convention should bear in mind in the very fine balance that is given to our 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> legislative process in these interpretations by the High Court. If that is to be disturbed in any fashion, it does require very considerable and in&hyphen;depth thought, because it has these sorts of consequences that we are trying to amend today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the Capital Duplicators case was being heard in 1993 it was felt that the High Court might disallow all business franchise fees in that case. Some emergency legislation was put into place. In fact, that legislation has just been resurrected and put into place here. Certainly it is something that you could have done with a bit of cooperation from the state governments. You would note that it was the Labor government in New South Wales that actually had the greatest difficulty in coming to any agreement with the Commonwealth on how to remedy the situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, the Carr government in New South Wales had been paid over $130 million in business franchise fees that they expected to pay from 6 August when this legislation comes into effect to the end of the year. It was going to be not only a windfall gain but a double whammy for the hoteliers in New South Wales. After much protesting, Bob Carr very reluctantly agreed to refund that money. The reason he was so reluctant to do that was that he had blown out the New South Wales budget enormously. New South Wales, of all the states, is heading for fiscal crisis by the mismanagement of a&mdash;wait for it&mdash;Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite amazing that he can willy-nilly increase his current expenditure and throw away any responsibility for fiscal balance or any of those pre-election promises that they so graciously make but disregard and do not keep.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have had experience of the way that they look after minor interests. Shortly before the by-election in my electorate they miraculously found money which had not been budgeted for, for a tollway promise, to refund a couple of million dollars to the tollway users of Sydney. It was not to lift the tolls, mind you, but to give them an incredibly complex paperwork exercise that they could go through in order to get the votes in Western Sydney.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7565">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fortunately, that did not work. Obviously, since it was not budgeted for, it was a recurrent expenditure. The people of Western Sydney could see that it was just adding to the budget deficit. They realised that eventually they would have to pay for that, and they have paid. They have paid for it with a pokies tax. They have paid for it with a bed tax. They have paid for it with a new land tax. They have paid for it with a jump in the stamp duty on car and home insurance. They have paid for it with the doubling of parking taxes.</PARA>

Then, `Whoops-a-daisy, we have to pay back $130 million because we did not get it quite right in the High Court. We are terribly sorry, but you cannot have that back.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is absolutely ludicrous. The member for Wills is worried about the extra money that might be raised by putting an even tax right across all of the states and territories. He wants to be assured that of the $4.9 billion raised by these fees amongst the states&mdash;when an equal tax right across all of the states will raise $6 billion for the Commonwealth&mdash;$1 billion will go back to the states. Between six states and two territories, I suggest that the amount would be something close to that $130 million that Bob Carr wants to rip off the hotel and liquor licensing bodies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Wills also seemed to suggest that&mdash;guess what?&mdash;the GST might be an answer to this problem. When you look at that, between 1993 and 1996 the Keating government increased the indirect taxes in wholesale sales tax by 60 per cent. He mentioned a 32 per cent wholesale sales tax on luxury items. Do you want to know what those luxury items are, Madam Deputy Speaker? They are colour television sets, clock radios, wall clocks, wristwatches, cameras and film, poker machines and pinball machines. They are basically staple, ordinary, standard 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of living items for the people in Western Sydney. That is the standard we aspire to in Australia. We do not expect that sort of provision to be called a luxury tax, but we will pay 32 per cent wholesale sales tax on that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other great joke is the other level of tax&mdash;the 22 per cent level of wholesale sales tax. We are paying that on our laundry powder, soap and liquid, pre-wash, fabric softener, soaker, stationery&mdash;writing pads, school exercise ruled pads, paper and pens&mdash;hand tools, power tools, garden hoses, paintbrushes, lawn&hyphen;mowers and batteries. Hang on a minute: that is a tax at 22 per cent on the people of Western Sydney. Thank you very much, Mr Keating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 12 per cent wholesale sales tax is put on food, which a majority of people in my electorate spend a substantial proportion of their salary on, such as ice&hyphen;cream, biscuits, lollies, fruit juice, cordial, flavoured milk and instant flavoured milk. Other items taxed at this rate include garbage cans and bags, paper plates, dishwashers, driers, stoves, airconditioners, toasters, electric jugs and kettles&mdash;luxury items, are they?&mdash;baby baths, baby bottles and cleaning sponges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indirect tax has been a Labor favourite. They love it. They have used it not only in federal government but also in state governments. They do it all the time and they wish to say, `But we don't do that sort of thing. Vote for us. Trust us. We don't do that.' And what do you know, when they get into power, bingo, there is an indirect tax. Check it out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a bit like the Labor Party saying, `We don't sell things. We oppose the sale of Telstra. We will not sell that.' We go to the electorate and say that we will sell Telstra, but the Labor Party say, `No, we oppose privatisation.

New South Wales raises $871 million from tobacco business franchise fees and Queensland raises $501 million. New South Wales raises $282 million from liquor and Queensland raises 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> $131 million. New South Wales also raises $8 million from gas and Queensland raises nothing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The distinction between the states in terms of these indirect taxes is quite noticeable, especially between Labor and Liberal states. This legislation unifies those taxes. It applies them levelly across all of Australia. That tends to be the way that the High Court has been directing and the federal government has been heading over the past decades in terms of federation and where our federation is heading.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a definite advantage in having this taxing power in the hands of a Liberal federal government, where you are assured that things will not be raised surreptitiously at two o'clock in the morning. It is here in the hands of a responsible government, not in the hands of Bob Carr's government where he could, willy-nilly, whenever he finds himself short of money to pander to minority groups slip in an extra tax on tobacco, liquor or petroleum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By and large those taxes are the ones that hit the people of western Sydney the most. Per capita we have more smokers. Per capita we drink more. Per capita we use more leaded fuel, whilst the wealthier suburbs can afford unleaded cars. Guess what? The western suburbs get it again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think this is a very important package of legislation. I think the Treasurer (Mr Costello) has done an excellent job in very difficult circumstances with the New South Wales Premier. I commend the bills to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like you, Madam Deputy Speaker, I had a little difficulty following exactly what the honourable member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly) was covering in her contribution and how it related to the package of franchise fee bills that are before the House. She should remember that the opposition has signalled its intention to support the legislation for the simple fact that we too understand the constitution, we understand the decision that was handed down by the High Court a couple of weeks ago and we understand that there is a need to redress the problem that emanated as a result of these decisions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7567">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I accept that she has every right to defend her own constituency of the western suburbs of Sydney, but I think she should also reflect upon the simple fact that the Commonwealth government also takes its fair share of those tobacco taxes, excises on fuel and so on that she claims hit her constituents. She also should reflect on the fact that, in successive budgets levied by her own government, we have seen $1.5 billion slashed out of the health budget in Australia and a pretty sizeable proportion of that in New South Wales. We have seen the cost of pharmaceutical benefits increased by this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also seen a decision taken by this government to cut out completely the allocation of funds under capital works programs for public housing. As I recall, having been to the honourable member's electorate of western Sydney, there is a fairly substantial number of people who live in that sort of accommodation. She should talk to them about this government's proposals to ensure that market rents are levied on housing commission homes and see how they feel about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When it then comes down to the discretionary income that they might have for the cigarettes, the alcohol or going to the Panthers club and pulling the old one-armed bandit or pushing the buttons, then come back here and talk to us about the effect that these sorts of decisions are having on the people of the western suburbs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sorts of constituents that the honourable member for Lindsay represents in western Sydney are exactly the sorts of constituents that I represent in Wollongong. I know that their reaction to the Howard-Costello budgets of the last 18 months is one of absolute horror. They know that decisions like the ones we are debating tonight in this package of bills have been brought about because of the simple fact that for a long period of time there have been arguments raging between Commonwealth and state governments about the distribution of funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the contribution by the last speaker, the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams), who is at the table, and I were having a small chat about its not mattering which government 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> happens to be in power in Canberra, because, irrespective of that, every time a Premiers Conference is held or every time there are conferences to discuss matters dealing with vertical fiscal imbalance between the states and the Commonwealth in terms of the distribution of revenues gathered by the Commonwealth and disbursed to the states, the states of New South Wales and Victoria often complain the loudest. They maintain that the distribution of funds to their states is absolutely out of kilter and out of balance with the population and the requirements of those states and that there is overcompensation for the less populous states of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To be fair to the Attorney&hyphen;General, that was not his view and he provided me with some statistics about his own state of Western Australia. I respect the comment he made in respect of his own state, but I think it is important to remember that one of the elements which should emerge as a consequence of this decision of the High Court, as a consequence of the need to bring this package of legislation before the parliament tonight and as a consequence of both sides of the House agreeing to give it swift passage, is the simple fact that it is time for an examination of the issues surrounding Commonwealth&hyphen;state financial relations. The Labor Party is not afraid to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much has been said about taxation reform and my colleague the member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson) talked about the implementation of a GST or consumption taxes of some sort&mdash;because at the end of the day the sorts of taxes we are embracing in this legislation are consumption taxes. The Labor Party has never been afraid of embracing the concept of taxation reform. I have got to say that in 13 years we did a little bit of it. We did a touch of it. When we came into government in 1983 the top marginal income tax rate was 60c in the dollar. We dropped it to 47c. The bottom marginal tax rate was 30c in the dollar&mdash;for the sort of people that my friend the member for Lindsay purports to represent&mdash;and we dropped it to 20c in the dollar. We did a little bit more in terms of taxation reform on the way through as well.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7568">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet she comes into this place and stands up and claims that all we have ever been concerned about is broadening the income tax base by increasing, in some way, some of those indirect taxes which exist through the sales tax mechanism or the wholesale sales tax mechanism. Indeed, some of that may well be right, but in terms of an equity argument we maintain that that sort of approach has been fair and reasonable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, the legislation which is with us today is something which touches not only questions of sales tax, but also two customs bills: the  Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1997  and the  Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1997 . The purpose of both of these is to increase the rate of customs and excise duty on certain tobacco and petroleum products. As indicated, it has arisen because of the decision taken in the High Court in the matter of Ha and Hammond and Others v. State of New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was a High Court case, of course, that people saw coming for quite some time. The member for Lindsay, using her legal background, traced some of the previous constitutional law issues which had arisen in respect of this. So it should not have come as a surprise that, when the High Court finally did hand down its judgment in respect of these matters, the Commonwealth was going to have to bring legislation in to fix up the particular issue which had subsequently evolved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we have indicated, that is not an issue that we have a problem with. We are quite happy to support that. There are a couple of matters of a very minor nature, I think, that are going to be suggested as an amendment, but I think that will not prove to be a difficult issue for either side of the House to deal with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) has come in and applied a gag to this legislation&mdash;probably some of the most important legislation we will deal with in the parliament this year. This government has decided to gag any discussion on it and not to give the opportunity for a full, frank and thorough examination, whether by those on this side of the House, by government members who might want to speak, or indeed by 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> some of the Independents who have an abiding and ongoing interest in taxation issues, particularly my good friend the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I did want to conclude by saying that the honourable member for Lindsay should be reminded of the fact that the government of New South Wales that she complains so much about was forced to introduce the HAC tax amendment back in 1996&mdash;that was the Howard&hyphen;Costello tax amendment&mdash;because of the problems created for that state by this government's approach to taxation issues.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the more significant implications of the recent High Court decision, aside from the obvious one of guaranteeing an even greater degree of vertical fiscal imbalance in our federation, is the removal of yet another safeguard to responsible state government. I have said in this place on many occasions that there can be no real fiscal responsibility in Australia unless governments are made accountable for the taxpayers' money which they have responsibility for and which they spend.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In removing the states' responsibility to impose franchise fees on tobacco, and by 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7569"> association fees on petroleum and liquor, the High Court has eroded further the checks and balances on the power of both the state and federal executive governments that are necessary to maintain their accountability. The decision to impose a national uniform income tax during the 1940s signalled the beginning of the end, and the dominance, as it turned out, of the Commonwealth in revenue raising ability. Since then federal governments have continued to become increasingly prescriptive in state activities through resort to tied grants, despite having no constitutional responsibility for the state programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The High Court decision of 5 August 1997 has provided the state Premiers with the opportunity to now push for a thorough recalibration of the federal&hyphen;state compact. The Western Australian state government alone stands to lose something like $600 million or 20 per cent of its annual revenue because of the ruling on the franchise fees. While there appears to be agreement on the part of all governments that the states will not lose out in pure revenue terms, they will unarguably become more dependent on the Commonwealth for funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendments to the relevant state sales tax bills will see wholesale sales tax on alcohol rise by a uniform 15 per cent. The existing Commonwealth sales tax of 22 per cent on beer will therefore increase to 37 per cent, while wine will now be subject to a wholesale sales tax rate of 41 per cent, rather than the current levy federally of 26 per cent. This will bring all states into line with New South Wales, which presently has the highest rate of sales tax on alcoholic beverages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Increases to the rates of customs duty on tobacco and specified petroleum products will be brought about by changes to the Customs Tariff Act 1995. These amendments will see the duty on petrol increase by 8.1c per litre to a standard 42.7c per litre in all states and territories. The most significant price increase will be on tobacco, with customs duty increasing from $84.27 per kilogram to $251.27 per kilogram. Overall, however, Treasury has given a commitment that no state's revenue will be worse off.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, the coalition has taken steps to ensure that the increases in wholesale sales tax will not have a detrimental impact on current small business exemptions from sales tax. Presently, if a small business has a sales tax liability that is less than $10,000, then it is exempt from this impost. Many of these small businesses will in future find themselves exceeding this threshold due to the 15 per cent hike in the rate of sales tax on alcohol. The government is right to exclude the additional sales tax when calculating the total tax liability of these small businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, I support the move to ensure that the increase in sales tax on liquor does not force small business over the quarterly remittance threshold. To oblige small businesses to pay monthly would create additional compliance pressures for the very group to which the government has promised relief. The final safeguard for taxpayers in this bill is the amendment that has been moved by the government in relation to the credits on alcoholic beverages.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has been suggested that business might be hit by additional compliance costs due to the originally proposed credit restriction, to which I referred just a while ago, and the government has moved quickly and properly to eliminate this restriction. While it is becoming increasingly unlikely that the government will fulfil its promise to reduce the paperwork burden on small businesses by 50 per cent in its first term, at least it will not add to the regulatory nightmare in this instance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another protective measure in this legislation relates to the taxable value of goods. Schedule 1 of the Franchise Fees Windfall Tax (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1997  sets out what appears to be a fairly straightforward calculation to ensure that the taxable value of alcoholic beverages does not change. As a result, any rebate or refund made by the states to a sales tax payer on alcohol will not diminish the taxable value of the goods. This is an important measure, because it will prevent a loss of revenue to the states and territories and is therefore supportable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Premiers have cried foul about the recent High Court decision, but the states have been complicit in the development of the vertical fiscal imbalance that now pervades our federation. They too must shoulder some of the responsibility for the unenviable situation in which they now find themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Fraser government's Income Tax (Arrangements with the States) Bill 1978 empowered the states to increase their revenue from personal income tax or to give a rebate on personal income tax to residents of a particular state. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard), who was then Treasurer, had this to say during the debate on the new taxing arrangements back in 1978:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill . . . (aims) at restoring a proper distribution of powers and functions between the federal, state and local spheres of government, with governments more responsive to the needs and preferences of the community. The government believes that this approach offers the best protection against concentration of power in Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He went on to note:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These arrangements (will) replace the old system of handouts with one in which the concept is sharing of tax revenues. . . . The states have received what they have been seeking for many years&mdash;a share of income tax revenues.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In short, the legislation would have given and enabled the states more authority over their own revenue and expenditure&mdash;the very thing that commentators, and the states themselves, today lament they do not have. It is worth remembering that not one of the state premiers took up the opportunity. Not one of them was prepared to take on the responsibility of appropriating by income taxation more of the money they were spending.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Opponents of the 1978 bill suggested that they were precluded from introducing state income taxes because of already high levels of personal income tax. It is true that the taxation burden imposed then by the Commonwealth on ordinary PAYE taxpayers had grown well beyond the role envisaged for it by those who drafted the constitution. However, it is equally true that the states opted not to commit to fiscal restraint and budgetary reform by becoming increasingly responsible for raising the revenue that was required to cover their expenses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Concern is now apparently being expressed that certain states are dragging their feet in putting in place the framework for the uniform reimbursement of money from franchise fees. The Commonwealth has sought to expedite this legislation and to help the states come to terms with their undesirable predicament. However, the states now have to help themselves. The ball is clearly in their court&mdash;and I mean no pun in referring to the Western Australian Premier.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In 1995, I listened with great interest to the member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) talking about the problem of vertical fiscal imbalance faced by the states. She showed then that the past decade had witnessed a dramatic decline in the payments by the Commonwealth to the state and territory governments. Commonwealth own purpose outlays rose by 11 per cent from 1983 to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 1996 whilst total payments to the states and territories dropped 22 per cent as a proportion of government outlays. This cut in revenue share was exacerbated by an increase in the proportion of tied grants. The member for Mackellar termed it as an abuse of section 96 tied grants, and I agree. Labor reduced the states' share of funding and simultaneously removed their flexibility in determining how their funds would be spent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In supporting the member for Mackellar at the time, another current coalition minister, the member for Pearce (Mrs Moylan), reminded the Keating government that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth Government has long forgotten that it is merely the trustee of income tax and excise revenues paid by Australians and that it is not giving to the States its own bounty. It is merely the trustee of this money. The States have responded to the challenge by increasing their own revenue sources from 39 per cent in 1982&hyphen;83 to 49 per cent a decade later.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The states saw themselves with little option other than to try to escape section 90 of the constitution, maintain their dependence on state charges and licence fees and a share of revenue from casino gambling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a former member of the coalition I moved a motion on Commonwealth&hyphen;state revenue sharing in 1994. At that time, I asked the simple question of the then Labor government: who is fiscally more responsible and better able to spend the hard&hyphen;earned money of Australian taxpayers and manage government services&mdash;the states or Canberra? I have always been of the view that the trend towards centralisation of power in Canberra is anathema to the ideal of giving Australians better and more efficient government services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This country needs governments to get closer to the people of Australia not further away. It needs to get closer to the people that governments are supposed to serve. States like Western Australia, which have led the way in micro-economic reform in this country, have consistently adopted tight fiscal policy in recent years and yet they are not able to get the services which they require funded by the central government. This should be extremely worrying when you consider that the services that state funds are targeted at are real com 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7572"> munity services such as health, education and law and order.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The unfortunate thing is that the coalition are also culpable because they have had 18 months in government in which to start the reform process and have done nothing but make it worse. What we are seeing from the Howard government is a transition from Keating to more of the same. Despite the promise of the then opposition leader, the now Prime Minister (Mr Howard), on revenue sharing, the states have been further punished for fiscal responsibility in light of the Labor government's deficit. The coalition have increased the conditional nature of states grants. We now see that revenue is dependent upon meeting national competition policy guidelines and making a contribution to the federal government's coffers to help recover from Labor's mismanagement.</PARA>

They have all done their part by struggling to overcome Labor's fiscal vandalism to return their states to productive membership of the Commonwealth and for their troubles they get less federal funding. Unless the states can be given a reliable expectation that their revenue base is reliable and will expand adequately to meet the legitimate expectation of Australians who live within their boundaries, they will continue to be driven to raise more and more of their own income.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Any reform of the Commonwealth&hyphen;state fiscal relations must be dealt with thoroughly. There were five principles that characterised the make&hyphen;up of the Fraser government's 1978 bill, to which I have referred earlier. This first stipulated the need for uniformity in taxation rates between the states and a system that was administratively simple and cost effective. The government of the day also indicated the need for a system that minimised the opportunity for tax minimisation and evasion and one that would be convenient for all taxpayers. The final consideration sought to give legislated arrangements that were free of any significant constitutional doubt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that every one of those standards remains valid and should be pursued by government in the renegotiation of the Commonwealth-state agreement. In 1989, the former Labor government repealed the Income Tax Arrangements with the States Act 1978. During the debate the then Treasurer, a well&hyphen;known centralist, Mr Keating, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The opposition's proposal to give the states greater taxing powers would put all that achievement at risk.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Handing the states taxing powers would merely provide them with the wherewithal to fund increased expenditures, claiming back to the public sector the area vacated by the Commonwealth. Australia just cannot risk leaving this act on the books.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I rejected the then Treasurer's comments at the time, and I reject them now. If we have states, we should give them proper power over their own finances and they should accept the responsibility that goes with that, but they have been loath to do that on the few occasions they have had to correct the imbalance. At the same time, the states must demonstrate a level of financial responsibility 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7573"> and political accountability that is commensurate with the powers which I have referred to and which they should have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In closing, I wish to make clear my understanding that neither the Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Western Australia nor the Retail Traders Association in Western Australia has a concern about the content of this bill. However, it is often the way that deficiencies in legislation are not uncovered until they are operational. I will be monitoring carefully the implementation of these amendments and will certainly pursue any related matters if the need arises.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Obviously, the aim of this legislation is to protect the current revenue base of the states and territories. Its concept is to replace state taxes declared invalid by the High Court with Commonwealth equivalents and to prevent people claiming back what was gathered illegally by the states. The aim of the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R290">Sales Tax (Customs) (Alcoholic Beverages) Bill</XREF>  is to protect an estimated $5 billion worth of revenue which has already been allocated in various state budgets; otherwise, significant supplementary funding would be required from the Commonwealth if the massive failure of state programs were to be avoided.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The limitation on the Commonwealth rescue of state revenue is that the Commonwealth cannot levy different rates of tax across the states. This means that states would levy differing rates of excise tax for the same goods. The Commonwealth is obliged to tax all states at the top rate for each commodity and attempt a system of refunds for those commodities whose tax rate has increased from the particular state rate to the top rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This relies on the states participating in the refund. It makes the scheme more complicated and unwieldy and would attract management costs for both the Commonwealth and the states. The effect is that the Commonwealth will have to impose Commonwealth taxes at specific rates, and we have discussed them already.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a short-term fix with a caveat that the government intends reviewing it in six months. There is no sundown clause. The government does not want one because it is

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7574"> state government,' but in the next breath he announced that he would legislate to deny them their constitutional rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This has been coming a long time, yet we still seem ill&hyphen;prepared for it. I can remember advice to members in 1993 in the wake of the decision in the High Court over the ACT trying to tax X-rated videos. We were told then that these state excises on alcohol, tobacco and petroleum were in trouble and were likely to be struck down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I accept that the government must act quickly and I understand that its view is that this course is necessary as a short-term solution. But even the thought that it will be in place for as long as six months should be of great concern to all members of parliament and all Australians generally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The decision by the High Court is a dramatic confirmation that the taxation and revenue raising system supporting government and the manner in which it is disbursed is totally out of control and operating in a fashion that was never intended by the framers of our constitution or those of us who have had the opportunity to amend it through referendum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have listened to people saying that this legislation is necessary because of a ruling by the High Court. It is clearly not the case. This legislation is necessary because the states have been acting unconstitutionally and the High Court has acted in accord with its duty. What worries me is that the Commonwealth sees no problem in introducing legislation to circumvent the constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I would have expected to see in the government's response to this crisis in state revenue raising was a statement of its objectives on a restructuring of the revenue sharing relationship between the Commonwealth and the states. After all, I recollect the present Prime Minister (Mr Howard) announcing on 6 June 1995:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a Coalition government will allocate a fixed percentage of tax revenue to the States and wind back the proportion of disbursements taking the form of tied grants so that the States will be able to decide their own priorities and stand accountable for them by the people of those States.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The coalition has a policy to reform the Commonwealth&hyphen;state revenue sharing arrange 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ments and announced it over two years ago. I would have expected that some inkling of its objectives, in light of this revenue crisis, would be announced now. This would take pressure off the government, which sees as its only answer to legislate a loophole to overcome the intent of the Australian constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Such a statement would also give the states an indication of their future revenue base and the manner in which they should plan to appropriate funds for the future. Instead we have in front of us a set of bills which sets a process in place to perpetuate something which was found to be illegal. We are told it will be reviewed in six months, but we see no leadership displayed on the matter of where we are going with this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mentioned earlier the problem of states revenue and in particular the greater and greater reliance on casino gambling income&mdash;a matter that is of particular concern to me. I notice at the table the Parliamentary Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles), who is a member of the Lyons Forum and would share my view that the burgeoning of casino gambling as a source of revenue for the states is a matter of grave concern to all Australians, and it is a matter that is exacerbated by this sort of legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you speak to ministers in the state governments&mdash;as I have spoken to ministers in the Western Australian government&mdash;you find that they now see revenue from casino gambling as an integral part of state revenue. Of course, they see it translated almost directly into the sorts of services that states are obliged to provide to their citizens&mdash;the core, fundamental services that states view as being integral to their duty and service to the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a matter of grave concern that, on the one hand, the states are providing these services and, on the other, they are relying more and more on revenue from casino gambling, which generates the sorts of social problems such as gambling dependence, bankruptcy, crime, drug trafficking, money laundering and even the withdrawal of money from the legitimate economy of the state.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The debate on Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997 [No. 2] is a continuation from last night. Many of us, certainly on our side of the parliament, wanted to see the sitting time extended because the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) was going to contribute. We were all very interested to hear what he was going to say, particularly about schedule 3 of this bill, which deals with the sugar industry. We all know that the honourable member for Kennedy has a particular interest in sugar. We know that the member for Dawson (Mrs De&hyphen;Anne Kelly) similarly has an interest in sugar. We would like to hear from both of those honourable members on their position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I mentioned, the legislation goes more broadly than simply talking about sugar. Last evening my friend and colleague the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) put the opposition's view very clearly in respect of that particular issue. What he said was that there was a belief, and I think a justifiable belief, that the issues surrounding the passage 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of this element of the legislation were in fact contrary to what the government had previously said. It was contrary to what the government believed was necessary and probably, dare I say, contrary to what they had taken to the people of Australia, particularly in sugar seats, when they told them what was going to happen should they be elected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have seen for Queensland sugar growers is changed circumstances. What we have seen for northern New South Wales sugar growers is changed circumstances. What we have seen generally is an unhappy mix as a result of the decision taken by this government in respect of this matter. It more broadly fits into the whole issue that is raging in Australia at the moment about industry assistance. It goes more broadly to the way in which tariffs and customs schedules might be applied to industries where it is considered that a particular status should continue to be enjoyed by those industries in the hope that we will not see massive job losses.</PARA>

We believe that whilst economic issues need to be considered when examining these matters so too must social consequences of decisions that are taken. I again cannot help but reflect upon decisions taken by the present government when forced to adopt Labor Party policies and principles in respect of the car industry. We all wait with bated breath to see what they are going to do next in terms of textiles, clothing and footwear.

Mr Deputy Speaker, you will be interested in this coming as you do from the mighty Illawarra, like me, and representing coalmining constituencies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Kennedy was recounting tales of glory when he played football against John Maitland, the national president of the miners federation, and what a close camaraderie they had and the sorts of political dialogue and discussions they would sit around and have, and he said that even to this day they do much the same thing. Again, on issues like coalmining and sugar the honourable member for Kennedy has very similar views to Mr Maitland, the president of the miners federation. I know Mr Maitland. If your views are close to Mr Maitland's, then you will certainly be voting with the Labor Party tonight or tomorrow or whenever this legislation comes to a vote because his views are the views that we are espousing.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a couple of other matters I want to raise associated with this customs legislation. I refer particularly to a couple of the schedules dealing with our relationship with Canada. I am referring as well to information technology agreements, which my good friend the member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans) would be vitally interested in, and also tariff changes due to AAT decisions. I very quickly would like to comment on each of those. The opposition is not opposed to those amendments and will not be prolonging any debate or division in this place in respect of those issues. But we will be prolonging the debate on the issue of sugar, and we flag now that the issue of the sugar tariffs will be subject to our opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Schedule 1 of the legislation before us is an administrative change. When the Customs Tariff Act was rewritten in 1995, a small number of editorial errors were revealed. As a consequence, there are some changes that are necessary there. All Customs documentation used since the commencement date of the new act&mdash;that is, 1 July 1996&mdash;quoted and used incorrect listing and rates of duties in a particular area, and as a consequence these changes will be put in place. Schedule 2 of the legislation goes to the bilateral trade agreement to which Canada and Australia are parties. It is called CANATA. Under this agreement, both countries allocate each other certain trade benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1995, Canada gave sugar from certain developing countries similar benefits to those received by Australian exporters. As sugar accounts for 20 per cent of Australia's exports to Canada, this decision had a serious impact on our trade. I am sure honourable members would reflect upon that very carefully. The then Minister for Trade, my colleague the member for Canberra (Mr McMullan), advised the Canadian government that Australia intended to remove the CANATA rates of duty from Canadian imports of petrochemicals, namely, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride and polyvinyl esters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1996, the incoming government reviewed the previous government's decision, and ministers Fischer and Moore decided to implement the withdrawal of the concession. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7578"> The five per cent margin of preference has been withdrawn since 1 January 1997. Again, this is a sensible move. It is part of the bilateral trade arrangement between the two countries and, as I have indicated, the opposition will not be opposing that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have referred already to the issue of sugar. The member for Kennedy and the member for Dawson will, I am sure, both be made welcome on the opposition side of this chamber when the vote is taken on this bill, as will, probably, a number of their colleagues. The member for Richmond (Mr Anthony) was also reasonably vocal. I can recall seeing a document that the honourable member for Richmond signed up to in the election campaign. He said that he would never ever support reductions of the sugar tariffs. A funny thing, that&mdash;the words sound a bit like the sort of spiel of our Prime Minister (Mr Howard) with respect to a GST, `Not ever. Never. No new taxes.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Richmond signed up to that. We have seen the documentation, we have seen the signature and we believe it is his. Accordingly, we would like to see him join the member for Kennedy and the member for Dawson on the opposition side when this issue is put to the test. Of course, it is all subject to the pressure that people like the Chief Government Whip, the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew), and others will be trying to bring to bear on these people of conscience as they vote to support something which is right. People like the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) will also have a hand in that, I am sure.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8I4">Mr MARTIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Free spirits in the National Party? Are you kidding? The Information Technology Agreement is another element of this. As I indicated, the member for Bonython has a great interest in this. This agreement seeks the elimination of tariffs on computer technology and telecommunications products by 1 January 2000. The agreement was signed by Australia on 13 March 1997 and has 41 signatories, which account for 92 per cent of world trade in these products.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia stands to gain substantially from the ITA. Exporters of electronic components, office machines and telecommunications equipment to the European Union, Canada, the United States and Asia will benefit from the tariff eliminations. It will ensure greater certainty of access through commitments to bind tariffs. The ITA will boost employment in this industry sector, which currently employs 30,000 Australian workers. The tables of tariff subheadings detail the tariff subheadings and goods which are affected by this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth pausing at this time to reflect on the fact that the Goldsworthy report was handed to the government in recent weeks and talks about the technology industry in this country. It talks about a whole variety of matters associated with government incentives to try to give substance to and support for this industry. Most members would probably not be aware that, in terms of technology, Australia is the second highest technologically advanced economy in our region; second only to Japan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we look to the next century, as we look to job opportunities that might be provided for Australians, as we look at the computer age and see where it is going to take us and as we see technology supplanting manual labour in so many other industries in this country, I think it is instructional that we should give some credence to and consideration of the Goldsworthy report. As a consequence of that, of course, any agreements that are going to be signed between Australia, the European Union and other countries will allow us to take a great deal of economic benefit from any trade arrangements that are put in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mentioned also that tariff changes due to AAT decisions are included in this bill. They go to the issue of surgical drapes, lamps in chapter 85, power supply units for computers and, in each one of these cases, certain classifications and duties applying are reviewed as a result of AAT decisions in respect of where each of those matters should be classified. Again, the opposition signals that it has no problem with this at all and wishes it speedy passage through the parliament.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7579">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, schedule 5 reviews the international model of the WCO, which has a six&hyphen;digit tariff. The difficulty is that Australia has added a seventh digit and an eighth digit to enable the application of different rates of duty to different goods within the international six&hyphen;figure tariff. On 1 July 1998, the duty rate on some of these seven&hyphen; and eight&hyphen;digit tariff subheadings in the textile, clothing and footwear section of the tariff will phase down to the same level, making the need for these subheadings redundant. The amendments in this schedule amalgamate them and this will simplify the tariff and make classification of goods easier. Where separate trade statistics are required by industry, the Australian Bureau of Statistics will provide statistical splits to gather the data.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On that specific matter, dealing with TCF, we signal that we would like to reserve our attitude at some time in the future if, in fact, this government decides to implement the recommendations on overturning some of the proposals contained in the Industry Commission's report on phasing down tariff support for TCF. We will have to wait to see how that will work. I know that the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) will be watching that with some interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have signalled our intention to support the TCF industry. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) met with representatives of the TCF industries the other day. Over the next three days there will be representations by a number of representatives of cities right around this country, whose TCF industries will be in dire straits should the decisions recommended by the Industry Commission be put in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are urging the government not to allow that to happen. We are urging the government to continue its support for the Labor Party's principles and objectives in respect of industry policy. They did it for the car industry. We are giving the lead now when it comes to the issue of textile, clothing and footwear. And, of course, we will continue to give the lead, combined with&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I come back to where I started in this debate to indicate that we oppose this schedule in respect of sugar. We know the member for Kennedy opposes this because he has been to his constituency and told the sugar producers, `In no way, Jose, are we going to support this. No way will I, as an upstanding member of the National Party, allow this to go through.' I know he has been here talking to a number of his colleagues. The member for Dawson was here last night. She came to give comfort to the member for Kennedy as he was preparing his great speech on this, which is about to be delivered in the next four minutes. We are all waiting to hear that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not sure whether the member for Dawson is on the speakers list. If she is not, we will give her a spot so that she can explain to the sugar producers of Dawson&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You are on the list. That is good. We do not have to give up one of ours for you. You can tell the people of Dawson, just like you did on phase 1 of the reef tax, how you are going to support this issue. This will be an interesting and instructive example because, as I mentioned to the member for Dawson last night, phase 2 of the reef tax is going to be coming in towards the end of this year. The electorate of Dawson is vitally affected by this government decision, just as it is by sugar. She will have an opportunity to practise her response on the reef tax later tonight in the debate on this Customs Tariff Amendment Bill because she will be able to tell us about the sugar industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me conclude where I started. I indicated that the opposition does not oppose schedules 1, 2 and 5. We certainly oppose schedule 3 in respect of sugar but not in respect of information technology tariff changes due to AAT decisions. The legislation before this parliament tonight is important, as it was last night. As I indicated, the honourable member for Burke went to a great deal of trouble to clearly set out why our party's position in respect of sugar is what it is. We simply say again to the government: we have laid out on 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7580"> this occasion, as we have in the past, a direction to be followed in industry policy. Do not let down those people whom you purport to represent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Richmond has signed a declaration in his own blood that he will support the sugar growers in his own electorate. We would like to think that that is going to be adhered to when he gets an opportunity to speak, as he will just before the member for Dawson.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We look forward to the contribution by the member for Kennedy. It is probably worthwhile getting an audience for him at some stage. I commend to the House those elements of the legislation which the opposition will support.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Although there are a number of reasons why a country has a tariff and why a country keeps a tariff, there are two outstanding reasons. The first is when you are competing against product that is subsidised. Sugar is a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7582"> product that for various reasons is heavily subsidised throughout the world. If you are looking for the base reason to have a tariff, it is because you are competing against highly subsidised product which can come in from other countries. I believe profoundly the second reason that a country has to have a tariff is when it is competing against countries that pay slave labour wage levels to their employees. I will read from the Report to the President Publication 2276 by the US International Trade Commission in 1990. The US International Trade Commission 1990 Estimated Tariff Equivalents of US Quotas on Agricultural Imports and Analysis of Competitive Conditions in US and Foreign Markets for Sugar, Meat, Peanuts, Cotton and Dairy Products.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The average subsidy for sugar in Japan for the years from 1986 to 1988 was 481 per cent. In the European Community the average is 193 per cent. The average for the United States&mdash;and I must pay them some tribute for honesty because this is a United States publication&mdash;is 175 per cent. In the international marketplace we find ourselves competing against countries such as Japan, that has a subsidy level of 481 per cent; the European Community, 193 per cent; and the United States, 175 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">None of these countries are exporters, with the exception of the European Community. The European Community is not only the biggest producer of sugar in the world but also the biggest exporter of sugar in the world&mdash;at 7.2 million tonnes, with Australia second at 4.2 million tonnes. They are dumping a product with a subsidy tariff equivalent of 193 per cent onto the world's market. Tonight many of the members of this parliament are moving to allow that product, subsidised at 193 per cent, into this country completely unsanctioned. All I can say is that the rest of the trading nations of the world must simply laugh at Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am deeply disappointed because, like so many people, I have such high hopes for the coalition government. When I heard our Prime Minister (Mr Howard) say, `No more nothing for nothing,' I thought at long last we were going to become, as we once were, a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> very aggressive trading nation. But, clearly, with decisions such as this, that is not to be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the way other countries treat the World Trade Organisation. We recently gave $1,000 million to Thailand. As a result of the WTO, Thailand, which has had a complete ban on the importation of sugar, has decided that they will shift down to a quota, and they are allowing some 13,150 tonnes of sugar into the country. To put that into context, we produce some 20 million tonnes of sugar in Australia. So their idea of free trade is a quota of 13,150 tonnes of sugar.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know, nor do I understand, how Thailand can afford to have a subsidy level of between 80 and 110 per cent, but that is the figure quoted by the Sugar Corporation of Australia and various other bodies. I have no doubt that it is true. Thailand is one of the major players in the world export market today and will probably become a very strong competitor for Australia in the international marketplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other sugar producing countries of the world are based in Central and South America where wage levels are commonly around $4 or $5 a day. We are asked to compete against such wage levels of $4 or $5 a day. It is with great pride that I reflect upon the fact that, in the main, the former Bjelke-Petersen government in Queensland has been responsible&mdash;along, of course, with the industry which deserves 90 per cent of the credit&mdash;for producing an industry that is competing on the world market against the tariff subsidy of 193 per cent. The sugar industry is set up in such an efficient way on economies of scale which are unrivalled anywhere in the world that we are able to produce this product.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper, Malcolm Fraser, a former Prime Minister of Australia, singled out sugar and said, `Europe is a country that should not be growing sugar. It is so totally non&hyphen;competitive that it should not be growing sugar.' Yet, far from accepting or listening to the advice of a former Prime Minister of Australia, whom I think is writing very sensible stuff at present, we are going in the complete opposite direction. Those are the reasons for having a tariff.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7583">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason for removing a tariff which we hear constantly from the economic rationalists in this place and in other places is to reduce the cost structures of Australian industry. I was a very strong supporter of that point of view until I saw how it had worked out in the petrol industry. We deregulated that industry and removed all the restrictions on the importation of petrol into this country. The net result was not a lowering of the price of petrol in Australia. In fact, what happened was that the price of petrol in Australia doubled. The price we paid the oil companies went from 12&half;c a litre to 22&half;c a litre in exactly the same period of time that the world price of petrol, as all of us are well aware, dropped clean in half.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So that was a magnificent success story! The oil companies were able to get away with 20c a litre which they were not entitled to. Their take doubled in exactly the same period of time as the world's price for oil dropped clean in half. If you multiply 20c a litre by the litreage in Australia, you come up with a very interesting figure of $6,000 million a year that that little economic rationalist initiative cost this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the highly controversial areas at the present moment is the motor vehicle industry. The very wise people who advise governments in Australia came out with the ORANI model. The ORANI model said that, over a 10-year period, there would be a 20 per cent intrusion of imports of motor vehicle and motor vehicle components into Australia. They were not far out! There was a 63 per cent intrusion over five years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was just how staggeringly wrong the economic models upon which decision making in this country was based and is based right at this very moment. Not only is the philosophy and the implementation of that philosophy flawed but also the programming, figures and information that is flowing from the public servants who are responsible for advising the government are dreadfully and fundamentally flawed, the motor vehicle industry being a classic example. A 63 per cent intrusion over five years is an easy statistic to reel off, but that translates into a cost of $5,000 million a year to the Australian 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> economy. At 30 jobs per $1 million, we have 150,000 jobs which have gone up in smoke as a result of that decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) has come into the House. He is a great advocate of economic rationalism. He is one of the great architects of the philosophy which has done so much damage to this country. He should sit and listen. He might well get an education because, after listening to his speeches, I can assure him that he desperately needs it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The arguments for having a tariff in the sugar industry could never be stronger. The major world exporter has a 193 per cent subsidy. I emphasise they are not my figures; they are the figures of the United States government. The United States government freely admit that they have a tariff subsidy equivalent of 175 per cent. So I do not think we can accuse them of dishonesty in this case. There could not be a more cogent reason than the fact that we are up against slave labour wage levels from South America.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason for removing the tariff is to reduce costs. The honourable member for Richmond (Mr Anthony) is also with us. I was very interested to hear him go into some detail on this tariff in one of his speeches. The ALP removed 60 per cent of this tariff; there is only 40 per cent of the tariff left that the government is attempting to remove this evening. The member for Richmond produced figures to indicate that, when the tariff of some $60 a tonne was removed on a product of some $350 a tonne&mdash;so it was a very hefty reduction in the price of sugar&mdash;the retail price of sugar for the consumers in this country did not go down but went up. We should pay tribute to the honourable member for Richmond for pointing out that to the House and to the people of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me move on: the reason that we are sitting here tonight allegedly is because the sugarcane growers of Australia want the tariff to be removed. All I can say is, `Please do not go to a sugar meeting and vent that sort of viewpoint.' I did hear a senator from this place put that viewpoint forward at a meeting in Ingham. I spent most of the meeting looking for a telephone because I thought I 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7584"> would have to get a police escort to get him out of the meeting in one piece.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sometimes we people from North Queensland may not be regarded as particularly clever, but I can assure you that we are not such big mugs as to voluntarily go out and ask for a pay reduction of $4,000 per man per year. That is what this translates to&mdash;a reduction in our incomes of some $4,000. I understand it is much higher in New South Wales, where all of their sugar goes onto the home market. It is probably some $14,000 per year there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sugarcane growers did not ask for the abolition of the tariff for any reason other than that the Hilmer gun was held at our heads. Whilst I do not wish to be churlish to the ALP&mdash;I am very appreciative of the fact that they are going to oppose this proposal&mdash;I must point out to the House that the reason we were placed in this invidious situation of a choice between deregulation or the abolition of the tariff was that the ALP passed the infamous Hilmer legislation and imposed that upon this industry and put the industry under great threat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It must be pointed out to the House why the sugar industry is placed under such great threat by deregulation. Unlike other products, sugar is a very cheap commodity per tonne. In fact, growers get paid only around $30 per tonne for the product. If a grower is paid $30 a tonne for the product and the cost of producing that product is $22 a tonne&mdash;I think that would be correct&mdash;to cart the product 100 kilometres would cost $10 a tonne. I know this because we cart from Mareeba to Mossman at the moment, and that is the figure that is quoted there. So, if you add $22 a tonne for the cost of production and $10 a tonne for the cost of moving it 100 kilometres, you make no profit at all; in fact, you make a loss on the product.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In other words, you cannot afford to put it in the truck and take it to the next mill. If we are deregulated, therefore we are placed in a monopolistic pricing regime because Australian farmers must take the price that is offered to us by the mill. No sane or intelligent person can impose upon an industry a monopolistic pricing regime. Yet that was the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> gun that was held at the industry's head and, on the basis of that gun being held at its head, many official representatives of the industry said they would prefer the tariff removal to deregulation, which would destroy the industry and most certainly place it under the control of a couple of big foreign companies very swiftly and we would be working for virtually nothing, as we have in days past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is an argument against the position that people like me are taking here tonight from those who say that we are placing them in jeopardy because we could be forced up before the National Competition Council.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I still have some belief that all politicians do not lie and that governments do not lie. The ALP in this House has said that regulation or deregulation of the industry is a matter for Queensland. The coalition in this House has said that it is a matter for the Queensland government. The ALP and the National Party and the Liberal Party in the state house in Queensland have said, `No deregulation.' So deregulation is not on the table.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Boswell has said on a number of occasions in the other place, we should never have made any decision to ask for the abolition of the tariff because deregulation was never on the table. I think Senator Boswell is correct, and I think deregulation has never been on the table. It is not on the table at the moment, so there is absolutely no necessity for us to abolish this tariff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even if I were to accept that argument, it is history now that the Queensland Sugar Corporation is already charging on the home market only the world price of sugar. So the tariff value to the sugarcane farmers has already been removed. Whatever so-called benefits will flow on to the consumers&mdash;and, listening to the honourable member for Richmond, I think they are negligible&mdash;they have already flowed. That is past tense. All we are talking about here with this tariff is keeping foreign product, which is subsidised and produced at slave labour wage levels, from coming into this country. That is all we are talking about here tonight, because the value to the consumers is past tense. I do not think there is any value to the consumer but, if there is, it is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7585"> already there because Australian farmers are no longer getting the benefit of the tariff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Queensland Sugar Corporation, which sells more than 90 per cent of our sugar, arguably is already selling that sugar to the Australian refineries at the world parity price. So the benefit has already flowed. So the other reason for doing this tonight has been removed. Both reasons have been totally and completely removed and do not exist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will move on and quickly recap the decisions taken by the economic rationalists in this place&mdash;whether it be the removal of tariff or the deregulation of industries. In the wool industry, we were enjoying an income of $6,000 million. It was the biggest export earning item. It was one-tenth of our entire exports. After it was deregulated, we were receiving under $3,000 million a year. So that decision cost this country, and is costing this country, $3,000 million a year. I do not want to heap too much praise upon the member for Richmond&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HX4">Mr KATTER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want on record that the honourable member for Werriwa, Mr Latham, has said that that is rubbish. If anyone wants to question his credibility, I suggest they go to the library and ask for the figures on wool. Then we will see how desperately inaccurate his interjections and his speeches are in this House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the Hilmer reforms, the coal profits in Queensland accruing to the Queensland government will be removed. Those coal profits on the railway lines are over $1,000 million a year. I am sure that we will get a letter of thanks from the Japanese coalminers and the American coalminers, who are now going to make an extra $1,000 million in profit while the Australian people are going to lose $1,000 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there are two major export earning items. We have given $3,000 million to the world buyers of wool. We are about to hand over more than $1,000 million a year to the world's coalminers. In the field of gold, we thought it was a good idea to allow the free interplay of market forces&mdash;let them all have 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> their play. Gold is going down in price; therefore, we will flog off all the gold. Don't worry about an aggressive trading stance on our second biggest export. Don't worry about this nation protecting itself and trading aggressively.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Chalmers Johnson, in his very definitive work on the Japanese economy and why it has leapt ahead of the rest of the world by such a huge margin, said that in Japan the industry department is not there to regulate; the industry department is there to create production. About $2,000 million has gone in the gold industry because we believe we should have a level playing field that should be taxed as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So those two little items cost us $2,000 million a year in that industry. The motor vehicle industry, I have already said, cost us $5,000 million a year. The petrol industry cost us $6,000 million a year. So the likes of Mr Latham have created for this country losses in five industries of $17,000 million a year, yet they still sit in this place and preach the same gospel to us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been a very sad day for me and the tobacco industry as a result of it being deregulated. We had 340 farmers and we will soon have only 150 farmers. We had $50 million of income coming to Australia, now we will have only $30 million of income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I have an old-fashioned notion that when you go into an election and make a promise then it is your duty to keep that promise. It is not with a great deal of pride that I read from page 32 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Reviving the heartland</EMPHASIS> of 5 February 1996:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Liberal&hyphen;National Government will:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> not reduce the sugar tariff beyond the present level of $55/tonne as we have already met our obligations under the World Trade Organisation (GATT `94) agreements.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I deeply regret that those promises will not be kept, and I gave them personally. I think that I, anyway, have to keep that promise. How we can keep the tariffs in the car industry and take them away in the sugar industry and then ask to have credibility with rural electors, I do not know. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Australia's sugar industry is one of our great national industries. It has been a great contributor to our export income. It has been the fundamental lifeblood of much of coastal Queensland. Australia is the world's seventh largest sugar producing nation and one of the largest exporters of raw sugar. Australia produces in excess of five million tonnes of sugar annually, with approximately 85 per cent of this being exported&mdash;and the proportion is growing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Queensland is by far Australia's largest sugar producing state, producing approximately 95 per cent of Australia's raw sugar and virtually all of our exports. New South Wales has a small industry and there is an emerging sugar industry now also in Western Australia. Queensland has about 6,400 cane farms, with an average farm size of around 75 hectares. The Queensland industry employs approximately 19,000 people directly and a further 26,000 indirectly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is an important industry. Any legislation that comes before this House that affects this industry is very important to Queensland, is very important to electorates such as my own and is very important to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tariff affects only imports into Australia. There is very little sugar that comes into this country. I am advised that only $70,000 of tariff was paid last year. That fact was reinforced in a recent letter from Mr Tony Gentile of the Australasian Soft Drink Association when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">What they fail to mention is that the Australian food industry does not import either raw or refined sugar.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The reality is that sugar imports are very limited at the present time. Perhaps the fundamental reason for that has been that there is such vigorous domestic competition between the Australian refiners that the domestic price has slumped so low that no-one would contemplate importing sugar into this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, for that reason, the tariff has been largely academic. It has not come into play in any significant way in the industry over recent times. It is unlikely that it will do so in the future. It provides a comfort to the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> industry, but it has not in recent years had a significant impact on the domestic market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find the Labor Party's attitude on this matter to be monumental hypocrisy. I cannot believe that we have Labor spokesmen, most of whom know absolutely nothing about sugar, coming into this House and feigning interest in the industry. If we look over Labor's record in the sugar industry, particularly their record in relation to tariffs, how can they come into this House with a straight face and pretend to be interested in protecting tariffs?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, are you aware of the fact that every single tariff reduction in the history of the sugar industry up until tonight has been made by the Labor Party? It is the Labor Party that abolished the sugar embargo. Prior to May 1988, sugar imports were totally banned in Australia. It was the Labor Party that lifted that embargo. At the time, they announced that they would introduce an ad valorem tariff of 35 per cent on raw sugar and 25 per cent on refined sugar, both phasing to 15 per cent by mid-1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The industry was appalled by this shock announcement by the Labor government. It was clear that the legislation was not going to pass the Senate, so eventually a compromise was reached and the government introduced a specific rate of tariff on imports of both raw and refined sugar of $115 per tonne from July 1989, falling to $95 per tonne in July 1991 and $70 per tonne in July 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party were not satisfied with that. They did not even honour that promise. In March 1991, in their economic statement, they reneged on that deal and announced further reductions. The scheduled $95 per tonne in July 1991 became $76, and the $70 per tonne went to $55. That is Labor's record. They are the ones who have cut tariffs. How can they now possibly stand in this House and pretend to be the defenders of tariffs?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But that is not all. Who was it that set up the sugar industry review working party that was required to look into the future of the industry? Yes, it was the Labor Party at federal level, and at that stage Queensland was unfortunate enough to also have a Labor government. They set up the review party. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7587"> They chose the people to undertake the review. Then, one of the conditions of that review was that they had to look at the industry in the light of the national competition policy. Let me ask you: who invented the national competition policy? Who commissioned the Hilmer report? It was the Labor Party: Prime Minister Keating, Premier Goss and the other premiers, most of whom were Labor at the time. And who was it that accepted the recommendations and endorsed them? Prime Minister Keating, Premier Goss and the Labor Party. They were the people who endorsed the national competition policy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was the Labor Party that commissioned the report. It was the Labor Party that appointed people to serve on that committee. Let us look at whom they chose. They chose people, I think, genuinely representative of the industry, initially under the leadership of Sir Eric Neal, who later went on to become Governor of South Australia and so could not complete the task, and Mr Bruce Vaughan was chosen to take his place. But on the committee were Ron Verri, chairman of the Australian Cane Farmers Association, and Harry Bonanno, chairman of the Cane Growers Association. Between them they represent every cane grower in Queensland. Farmers are all members of those organisations. Also, there were representatives of the Australian Sugar Milling Council, the Australian Soft Drink Association Ltd, the sugar industry review coordinator, and some public servants and the like&mdash;all people appointed by the Labor Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, when the report came in, it was a unanimous report. There were 74 recommendations, all of which were approved unanimously by the committee. The committee's recommendations were wide ranging and included some very significant matters of vital importance to the industry, such as the retention of the single desk arrangements on the domestic market. There are no other primary industries which enjoy that privilege, so that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> was a very substantial recommendation of the committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They also recommended the retention of pooling and the assignment system&mdash;again, unique to the sugar industry and not generally approved of in other industries. Those are considered by the sugar industry to be fundamental planks to the future of their industry. But the committee, in one of its very early recommendations, also recommended that the tariff should be abolished from 1 July. The industry&mdash;those on the review committee&mdash;unanimously recommended that the tariff should go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that the sugar industry dealt itself a pretty tough card. As the previous speaker, the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter), said, the coalition went to the last election promising to retain the sugar tariff. I believe that promise could have been sustained, and would have been honoured, had it not been for the fact that the working party and the industry unanimously recommended that the tariff should go. What responsible government could talk to the industry leaders, listen to what they had to say, and then not do precisely what they had asked it to do?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know, and it is beyond dispute, that there are many farmers who do not understand the recommendations of their presidents and their leaders. There are many farmers who would like to retain the tariff. They see its comfort element as being important. They believe that it is a part of the protection that their industry would like to have. But the reality is that their elected leaders made a recommendation to the government, and it is therefore my view that the government has little option but to endorse that recommendation. To be fair to those leaders, they believed that they were delivering a comprehensive package of 74 recommendations. They made it clear that they did not want some adopted and not the others. They wanted the package adopted lock, stock and barrel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Queensland government was quick to accept the working party's recommendations and to agree to the proposals that were put forward. The Commonwealth government has been much slower to respond and I have to acknowledge that I, and some of my National 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7588"> Party colleagues, were amongst those who urged the government to be cautious. We were conscious of the fact that there were ordinary growers who felt they wanted to keep the tariff and we needed to work through these sorts of issues to ensure that we were taking the industry with us in our dealings on these particular matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I do not believe the government and the parliament has any option other than to accept the recommendations of the working party&mdash;the committee that was established to look at just these sorts of measures. I have to say that there are a number of the other recommendations which will have a much bigger impact on my electorate than the abolition of the sugar tariff. For instance, the decision to get rid of the two-pooling system will benefit sugar growers in electorates such as that of the member for Dawson (Mrs De&hyphen;Anne Kelly) but will cause significant disadvantage in my own area where most of the growers have been long&hyphen;term growers and therefore suppliers to pool No. 1. They are going to lose some returns as a result of that and I believe they will lose more from that decision than they will lose from the loss of the tariff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But perhaps most important of all was the quite curious recommendation of the working party that the domestic price should be set at export parity level. Export parity pricing means that Australian sugar users will get the advantage of buying sugar at a price cheaper than it can come into this country by the equivalent of the freight. It would have been perfectly reasonable for the review working party to have recommended that the price should have been set at import parity. It would certainly have had a significant benefit to growers in real returns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But they took the tough decision. They decided that they were prepared to lay their industry level with the rest of the world and to compete against them on the domestic market. I think that was a very courageous decision. But those two recommendations alone will have a much more significant effect on the welfare of the growers of sugar in my electorate, and indeed in many of the other parts of Queensland, than the decision to abolish the tariff.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can understand as well why the sugar growers of my electorate are concerned that their tariff is going, only weeks after the government has announced a package that will sustain a tariff regime for the motor vehicle industry. Naturally, they have got a right to feel upset that they are losing their tariff while they are still going to have to pay $2,000 to $3,000 extra to buy a car because of the tariff protection for that industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They will be particularly annoyed because, just weeks after the government announced its tariff package for the motor vehicle industry, the car companies turned around and gave an industry leading pay rise to their workers. They were bleating about how the industry could not survive, yet they could afford, immediately after the tariffs were announced, major pay rises for their workers. This naturally concerns the growers in my area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are also noticing the lobbying from the textiles, clothing and footwear industries to protect their tariff. I was interested to read the submission of the Council of Textile and Fashion Industries of Australia, in which they were arguing for the retention of the tariff in their industries. On page 20 of the submission is an extraordinary confession. While they are talking about a loss of jobs in Victoria and, to some extent, New South Wales if the TCF tariff goes, they say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Queensland, Western Australia and the two territories experience only small job losses in TCF industries&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is assuming the tariff goes. They go on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is more than offset by the benefit to them of job increases in other traded industries, together with the regional multiplier effects of this on non-traded industries. Queensland has a jobs gain of about 4,000, Western Australia, 2,600, and the two territories 1,000.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The textiles, clothing and footwear industries are themselves arguing that there will be job gains in Queensland, Western Australia and the territories if the tariff goes. So these stories are not simply one way. The facts are that Australia has been active in fora such as the World Trade Organisation in seeking to liberalise trade barriers, to work towards a situation where there is fairer trade around the world. We have only a very small domestic 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7589"> market. For sugar, it is around 10 per cent of our production. So we have a vested interest in having freer trade around the world. As an efficient producer of primary products in particular, with an educated and skilled work force, we can expect to expand our markets enormously if barriers to our products are eliminated by other countries around the world. It only requires about a third of our existing farmers to produce the food that is necessary to feed our population. So our farmers are particularly dependent on having access to world markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that Australia is therefore right to be pursuing freer trading rules, but of course we should not pointlessly sacrifice Australian industries unless there is a clear indication that other countries are also relaxing their trading rules. The Deputy Prime Minister, the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer), who I note is at the table now, made the point again just recently that Australia is not prepared to unilaterally reduce its tariffs unless other countries act likewise. It is pleasing to note that there has been considerable progress in breaking down barriers. Let us look at some of the recent events.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over recent months Mexico has reduced the tariff on Australian wool. Malaysia and Thailand have eliminated tariffs on a range of dairy products. Korea has lifted artificial barriers on Australian meats and is taking our poultry. Taiwan will be accepting Australian fruit. The United States is taking another 85,000 tonnes of Australian sugar. So the sugar industry as well&mdash;indeed, all farmers&mdash;stand to benefit significantly from genuinely free and fairer trade around the world. We should not unilaterally disarm, but we should certainly be active in building new markets wherever we can.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I emphasise again that in this regard the government is acting in accord with the expressed wishes of the working party report and, in particular, with the elected leadership of the industry. I wish to quote a couple of comments made by the Sugar Milling Council. You would probably expect them to want the tariff to go. Mr Graham Davies, Chairman of the Australian Sugar Milling Council said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report recognises that the sugar industry is fundamentally export&hyphen;oriented, and recommends strategies that will improve the industry's competitive advantage.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Working Party has proposed a balanced set of recommendations which will facilitate the development of an internationally competitive export&hyphen;oriented industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important that these recommendations be adopted as a comprehensive package.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Dr David Rutledge of the Queensland Sugar Corporation said that `the implementation of the recommendations in the unanimous report to the state and Commonwealth governments would ensure an export&hyphen;oriented raw sugar industry which would benefit both sugar industry participants and the wider community'. Mr Allison, the General Manager of the Australian Cane Farmers Association, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe we have before us a report that is a balanced package, which addresses commercial realism and competitiveness; a base to an economically, environmentally sustainable industry.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In today's language, the report is a proactive statement designed to promote the wellbeing of the sugar industry.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Harry Bonanno, Chairman of the Cane Growers, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As well as satisfying National Competition Policy principles, the package transfers substantial benefits to the Australian community from the sugar industry. The good news for growers is that it retains the strengths of our current production and marketing arrangements which have made us one of the world's most efficient, productive and least assisted sugar industries, while providing opportunities for greater flexibility, innovation and local control.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GT4">Mr TRUSS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was Harry Bonanno. The leaders of the industry have certainly made their position clear on this matter. The tariff has indeed had some degree of symbolic presence for the industry. It has been a comfort it has liked to have, particularly in the corrupt world market which still besieges the sugar industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us remember as well that currency movements, sometimes just in a week, are 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7590"> enough to wipe out the equivalent of the tariffs that we might have in place. Indeed, the slide in the Thai baht in just one week would have so substantially reduced the price of Thai sugar as to make the effect of our tariff almost useless. These factors need to be taken into account in assessing the real value of the tariff compared with what the industry has chosen to give its highest priority to; namely, retaining single desk status, retaining its organised marketing structure, and retaining the real strengths of the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A few years ago, I stood proudly with my colleague at the time Ray Braithwaite when he opposed the Labor government's decision in 1992 to reduce the tariffs, and the opposition parties of the day did not vigorously oppose it. I stood with him at that time because the government and, for that matter, the opposition parties, were acting against the wishes of the industry. This time, the government is acting in accord with the industry, and so I will be supporting the bill.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this short adjournment speech I wish to pay tribute to the work of Missions to Seamen nationally and internationally. But particularly I wish to pay a special tribute to the work of the Missions to Seamen at Port Kembla, to Lance Puckeridge, the chaplain, and his wife, Merle, who very much work as a partnership and are the mission at Port Kembla. As a member of the committee of the Missions to Seamen at Port Kembla I have seen at first&hyphen;hand the work that Lance and Merle do in providing comfort, support, advice, counselling and spiritual help to seafarers from all over the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On Saturday, 23 August 1997 there was a rededication of the mission at Port Kembla. Port Kembla is no longer part of the Sydney mission but is now on its own. This is a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> challenge to us at Port Kembla, but a challenge we will meet as it is vitally important that we continue the presence of the mission at Port Kembla. But what happens at Port Kembla&mdash;the care, the assistance and the concern for seafarers&mdash;is repeated throughout the world. In ports in diverse and inhospitable places there is always warmth and fellowship at the missions. From the tropics to the icy north, the flying angel is a sign of fellowship, comfort and understanding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Missions to Seamen was started by the Anglican Church in England in 1835. It is a voluntary society which provides support and counselling services to seafarers in over 300 ports around the world. In an average year, the mission makes over 57,000 ship visits, welcomes 800,000 seafarers to its centres, responds to some 400 requests for help in justice cases and visits over 1,000 seafarers in hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Port Kembla Missions to Seamen was established in 1942. Lance Puckeridge has been the longest serving chaplain on the Australian east coast and just last year over 7,800 people passed through the Port Kembla mission. I personally believe that in coming years the work of the missions will become even more important as it appears the Australian coast run is about to be open to the rust buckets of the world. The world's shipping fleet is ageing. Shipping is a very competitive business. Pressures are exerted to cut costs. It seems that it is usually the wages and conditions of the crews that are the first to suffer. This is not the main cost of shipping, but they are always the first things to suffer. Many of these crews are from Third World countries. They have no-one to defend them or depend on but the missions or the International Transport Federation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Chaplains at all missions can tell you horrific stories of mistreatment or malnutrition of crews. In Australia, we have seen the murder of Third World seafarers, such as the incident at Glory Cape off Port Hedland last year&mdash;and very little has been done about that even to this day&mdash;and many instances of seafarers disappearing off the coast of Australia if they dare to complain.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7591">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been told many times, as other people have been, that if seafarers come into one of Australia's ports and make contact with the International Transport Federation and complain they often, not always, disappear off the Australian coastline. This could be on a trip from Sydney up to Brisbane. There have been examples of beatings and mistreatment. People who think that people like myself and the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) exaggerate when we speak on such topics only need to talk to the chaplains, like Lance Puckeridge, from the many missions around Australia and they will find that they all tell the same stories of the mistreatment and malnutrition of many seafarers, especially those from Third World countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet through all this the missions serve as a beacon to seafarers of whatever race, creed or wherever they come from. In Port Kembla, as in missions throughout the world, they find a safe haven, comfort, fellowship and spiritual assistance. The seafarer's life means isolation and long absences from family, home and friends which create a host of special problems. The missions are always there at the dock to offer a welcome, to help with problems, to arrange contact at home and to provide care and fellowship. Long may the work of the missions' chaplains such as Lance Puckeridge continue. Long may it be a beacon throughout the world. Long may the flying angel be a sign of fellowship, comfort and understanding to seafarers throughout the world.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="7591"><TITLE>Diana, Princess of Wales: Death</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to express, on behalf of the people of Capricornia, distress and extreme sorrow at the loss of Diana, Princess of Wales. I, like many people, like someone special in the royal family. Princess Diana and the Queen Mother are the two that I consider to be great role models and if I hear their names mentioned I always listen with great interest. This is not to say that I am not fond of the others, but we are all individuals and they are my choice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Princess Diana was the fairytale princess. She entered the royal family through marriage 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and, in my opinion, fulfilled her role as princess without fault. Time passed and we saw the end of her marriage. This was the point when I considered her to be one with the most to lose so I felt sorry for her and decided to watch where she ended up. I felt Charles would be alright. What happens to a lady when she is brought into the royal family and then suddenly is out of the inner circle, especially when she has two young children?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have never been a purchaser of magazines of the type that print photos and gutter stories about people because so many of them are purposely produced to be controversial&mdash;I would not waste my time to read them. In the past years the paparazzi have become very well known for the trouble that they will go to to get that photograph of an individual. I hate it. These people are what I consider to be legal stalkers. Action must be taken to outlaw their acts of intrusion before they cause any further distress to the public or their subjects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said at the start of this address, I feel that we have suffered a great loss. I am also angered that the chase to make a buck for some may have been the cause of these deaths. This is tragic and I hope the law has the ability to bring these perpetrators to justice, should they be found to have played a role in this accident.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This afternoon I received a fax from a young lady in Capricornia, Vanessa Tailor. The thrust of her letter was that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) should go to the funeral of the princess as it would, I am sure, help all Australians to say goodbye in our time of grief.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Princess Diana gave her life to help so many, and she touched the lives of so many throughout the world. Her fight was to help people suffering from AIDS and leprosy, to help those who were disadvantaged and to stop the use of landmines&mdash;all issues that the normal, everyday person would most probably shy away from. This lady was one of a kind and we are right to grieve her loss.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My prayers and the occasional tear flowed to her children, Prince William and Prince Harry. These boys will feel the pain of the loss of their mother for some time. I know 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7592"> what it is like to lose your mother, as I lost mine when I was 11 years of age. It hurts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The hardest part for me was accepting what had happened and then at the time looking for someone to blame. I know that children handle grief differently to adults, as they are too young to understand what has happened and to accept the explanations. I know that it took me about four years to accept what had happened, and then I started to grieve my loss. I pray that the boys have their father to be close to, as I would have been lost without mine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also hope people are patient with Prince Charles, as his love and the time he will need to spend with his children will take time from his normal daily schedule for quite some time. He has his family around him and the boys will need their dad now more than ever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In closing, I say once again that we have suffered a great loss. I hope that the legacy of the princess is always remembered and her work is not forgotten. The people of Capricornia and the parliament send our prayers of support to her family. The Queen of people's hearts was a saint and her name will touch people forever.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="7592"><TITLE>Royal Australian Navy: Malayan Veterans</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Many members of this House are aware of the continuing denial of justice to Royal Australian Navy veterans of the Malayan emergency. I understand, Mr Speaker, that you are one who, in your capacity as a member of this place, has lent a sympathetic ear to the case of the veterans.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst the 1997 budget has provided some partial and very much belated recognition of `operational service' for those veterans, an `active service' role for the RAN has continued to be denied by the government. They are also unjustly denied the campaign medal&mdash;that is, the Naval General Service Medal, Clasp Malaya.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many members of this House are aware of the arguments about this. The Royal Australian Navy was allotted as a component of the Strategic Reserve on 1 July 1955. In recent times, the argument from the boffins in the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> bureaucracy has tended to relate to denying that RAN personnel in that campaign were exposed to real danger. I would like to tell, perhaps over several adjournment debates, some real tales as told to me by those veterans to expose the nonsense of that proposition. I apologise for some of the graphic detail in the tale I will tell tonight. It was told to me by Keith Davidson, who was in the gunnery division on HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Anzac</EMPHASIS>. His story is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the 26th April, 1957 whilst serving onboard ANZAC in FESR during the Malayan Emergency and in the company of our sister ship HMAS TOBRUK the following incident occurred.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Anzac and Tobruk were part of a night operational gunfire encounter exercise with two Royal Navy destroyers and a cruiser . . . During this exercise both RAN ships were the target of illumination by star shell fire. My duties on that night were C.O. of "B" gun bay.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the star shell firing an announcement was made that the exercise had been terminated and for all ships to undarken ship due to the Tobruk having been hit by gunfire (star shell) from a RN ship. The projectile passed through the forward mess deck and into Tobruk's "B" gun bay where the projectile ricocheted inside.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Killed was Able Seaman Robert Spooner 21 years of age and critically injuring Able Seaman J.R. Stevenson who was transferred to the British Military Hospital in Singapore. Able Seaman Spooner was buried at sea the next day the 27th April, 1957.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the 7th May, 1957 both Anzac and Tobruk arrived in Hong Kong. I went ashore to the Fleet Canteen and met up with my mate Able Seaman Lance Spurway who was also a gunnery Quarters Armourer and was my opposite number on Tobruk's "B" gun bay.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our conversation centred around the incident of the 26th April. Lance told me that Bob Spooner's leg was off at the hip and that he was in three pieces in the gun bay and that Stevenson's right leg was broken and really smashed about. Lance said that the ship's surgeon Lt. Clark did as much as he could under the circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Lance then went on to tell me that three days after the incident he was cleaning up the gun bay and working behind a servo pump when a string of Bob Spooners intestines stuck to his hand. After this occurrence he was moved from "B" gun bay to duty on the bofor anti aircraft guns at the rear of the ship.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During our conversation I could see that Lance was very upset at having to recall the incident so I 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7593"> changed the subject to our happier times and proceeded to drown our sorrows.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This incident was most distressing for Tobruk as well as the Anzac's ships company and demonstrates how vulnerable we were in the service of our country far from home. Bob Spooner was not as lucky as we were he did not return, his remains committed to the deep with a simple prayer</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is one example&mdash;and I intend to give plenty more&mdash;of real tales told by Australian veterans of the Royal Australian Navy in the service of this country. The boffins in the bureaucracy&mdash;unfortunately supported by their ministers&mdash;continue to deny that these people provided active service for this country. That is a disgrace and this House has an obligation to ensure that they are given justice.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="7593"><TITLE>Medicare Offices</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the budget earlier this year, the government announced the closure of 43 Medicare offices across the country. They were closing them predominantly in city areas, wishing to keep them open in regional and rural Australia where the country towns are literally dying.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the Medicare offices that was closed was in my electorate in the suburb of St Ives at the St Ives Village Shopping Centre. I received from my constituents some 9,000 signatures to a petition which they wished for me to present to the House, but it was not in accordance with the protocols of the House. In fact, it had been addressed to the Mayor of the Ku&hyphen;ring&hyphen;gai Council.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also received in my electorate office about 300 letters from constituents who were somewhat critical of the decision of the government to do this. As the representative for the electorate, quite naturally, I have brought to the attention of the Minister for Health and Family Services, Dr Michael Wooldridge, the fact that there is significant opposition in my electorate to the closure of this Medicare office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have also pointed out to my constituents that, whilst this is irritatingly inconvenient for us, eight kilometres from this particular Medicare office is a Medicare office at Hornsby and 12 kilometres south of this office is an office at Chatswood. Within several months there will also be available electronic 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> processing of Medicare claims from doctors' surgeries and constituents continue to have the right to mail a claim form available from any doctor's surgery to the Health Insurance Commission and receive a refund cheque in about three weeks time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This issue, however, raises perhaps a bigger one, that is, what is the role of a representative? I have pointed out to my constituents that, whilst this is understandably something about which we in Bradfield are concerned, when I surveyed the electorate last year the issue of greatest concern to them was Australia's national debt. The government, having inherited a $10.3 billion deficit, set about returning the finances of the nation to a surplus. Of course we will be running a $1.6 billion surplus next year and a $10.6 billion surplus in 2000&hyphen;2001. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In other parts of Australia, low income people have lost funding for dental health care. They have lost in areas of relatively high unemployment labour market programs. Commonwealth Employment Service offices have been closed. There is a significant human toll being paid by those who are  suffering the effects of industrial readjustment, particularly in regional Australia. We hear of, and I know of, Australians who are working in areas where they have relied on forestry, for example, where there is significant unemployment as we reconcile the needs for environmental preservation with the needs to develop Australia's forestry and timber industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to my constituents that, whilst it is my duty, as I have, to represent their concerns and their views to the government of the day, the national interest cannot always be divorced from what individual constituents want in any electorate. If the greatest price my constituents pay for returning Australia's national accounts to a surplus is to have a Medicare office close in an area that is relatively well serviced, in an area that is relatively well off compared with other parts of Australia, then perhaps the sacrifice we are making is not that great.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I pay an electoral or political price for what I am saying and what I have said to my constituents, then so be it. At least I know 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7594"> that I have come to the federal parliament to serve not only the interests of my own constituents but indeed the interests of the nation. It is very important that all of us remember that in the end we are not always going to get what we want, and that what is popular in any individual electorate is not always consistent with the best interests of other people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst I am naturally aggrieved by the fact we are losing a Medicare office in my electorate, when I think of people, for example, in the electorate of Mallee and the electorate of Kennedy and in many of the National Party and Liberal Party held regional seats, I say to my constituents in the electorate of Bradfield that, if we lose a Medicare office to keep others open where country and regional Australians desperately need them, then I, for one, am prepared to accept that price.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="7594"><TITLE>Diana, Princess of Wales: Death

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Sunday's death of Princess Diana must, when the grieving has stopped, warn us of the presence of an insidious sickness in our society&mdash;voyeurism. Those paparazzi whom Diana was fleeing when she died were acting as agents for all of us who buy the magazines, buy the newspapers and watch the TV footage for the latest bit of scandal. Diana's brother was right when he said that the media has blood on its hands. But I do not think the blood stops there. We need to realise what kind of society we have become and just how low we have sunk.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly Diana's car was travelling way too fast, but that misses the real point. People who draw attention to this are really saying that Diana could not escape the paparazzi, that they could record and photograph her every move. Does anyone here seriously think the paparazzi or the media who buy their pictures have any standards, that they would have drawn the line, for example, at photographing Diana and Dodi in the cot? I don't. I think that is precisely the picture they were after.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How is Diana supposed to survive this? Join a convent? Don't think for one minute that the culture of voyeurism and a media 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> with no sense of personal dignity is confined to the feral tabloids of Britain or France, where Princess Diana and Dodi Al&hyphen;Fayed died. Let me give the House a few home&hyphen;grown atrocities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Only a week ago a small businessman committed suicide after being accused by <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Current Affair</EMPHASIS> of being a rip-off merchant. If we go back a bit, a Mr Graham Glisson was woken between 4 a.m. and 5 a.m. one morning by `two Rambos, one with a tape recorder and one with a camera', who wanted to interview him about the death of his daughter at 4 p.m. the previous day. He was still in a state of shock and his brother sent them away, but an hour later they woke them from their beds again to get the story.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1986, 12 men were entombed by a coalmine explosion in Moura, Queensland. The pregnant widow of one of the trapped miners was approached by a journalist at 1.30 a.m. and offered money for her story. On another occasion a photographer posed as a doctor to gain unauthorised entry to a hospital where he took pictures of an actress suffering from a drug overdose. One Melbourne paper published a photograph of two grief&hyphen;stricken women who had just heard that their husbands' bodies had been found in a blizzard at Mount Hotham in Victoria. The picture was taken without the women's consent by a photographer using a long&hyphen;distance lens. The Press Council, joke that it is, did not even uphold the women's complaint of invasion of privacy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Two different Melbourne papers, in a foretaste of the nightmare that would engulf Diana, published in 1981 transcripts of alleged tape recorded conversations between Prince Charles and his then wife to be, Lady Diana Spencer, even though the tapes were almost certainly fakes. One TV station sifted through Ita Buttrose's rubbish bin for cheap laughs on Terry Willesee's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Eye on Australia</EMPHASIS> program. Reporters here are said to steal photographs off the mantelpieces of bereaved relatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the years work has been done by committees and commissions on privacy protection, but very little has ever come of them. We did have an election commitment

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But no government has ever tackled this sickness head on. The truth is that politicians and political parties are terrified of the media. We could kill this paparazzi thing stone dead simply by banning the publication of photographs taken without the subject's consent. Why should someone be able to take photographs of us without getting our consent and sell them for personal gain? There would need to be exemptions of course. The police could approve the publication of photos for persons wanted for criminal offences. Consent could not be given selectively or subsequently withdrawn. You would need to arrange prior approvals for sports events, broadcasts of parliament and all sorts of things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year the Prime Minister acted decisively on guns and won the support of a nation for his strong stand which created something good from the national tragedy at Port Arthur and turned us away from a descent into a violent gun culture. The death of the Princess of Wales is a world tragedy. Is it not once more time for the Prime Minister to act decisively to rid us of another scourge&mdash;the incessant invasions of privacy which come, it must be acknowledged, from the voyeur in us all but also from a media which has lost its way and is caught in a vicious, ever downward spiral with standards falling, falling, falling in the incessant drive for sales and profits and an edge on the competition?</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="7595"><TITLE>Media Intrusion</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I endorse fully the comments of the member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson). No-one who has witnessed recent events could fail to be shocked by the excesses of the media. But what is the media? It is a group of multimillionaire and billionaire publishers, select and small of number, whose defence relies on the importance of the public's right to know. How abused is the phrase `right to know'? How its application leads to the grossest abuses of human rights. I have not been a great fan of royalty or indeed the circus surrounding the late princess.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have admitted to my indiscretion and acknowledged my guilt. The great majority have said, `It is your business and none of theirs.'

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Chris Griffith of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Mail</EMPHASIS> illegally entered my home when I was not there. He was ordered out by my son. The process was captured on film. A very dear friend had the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS> paparazzi illegally entering her property. Illegally, after being warned not to do so, they opened a private letter sent by me to her. They photographed her front door with the flowers. They published her name and former occupation to insinuate some previous liaison. They bribed her neighbours in order to get reports of whether I visit her. They disclosed to the world where she lives. They photographed and harassed my first wife, a lovely person who has nothing to do with this matter. They photographed and harassed my former wife, who equally has nothing to do with this matter. Both are innocent yet portrayed as guilty by association with me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They hounded and harassed my legal colleagues, threatening and demanding comments in order to promote a distortion of truth. They hounded and harassed me and deliberately published misinformation and distortion in order to provoke a reaction from me to create another story. They inveigled me into `cooperating' when possessing no ethics. I mention Tony Koch. Tony Koch said to me, `I won't be the messenger for an arsehole.' Well, Mr Koch, you went one better&mdash;when publishing the performance of a particular individual who I will not go into.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yes, this is the media who are blaming the paparazzi who want to continue. I complained to the deputy editor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS>, who agreed it was outrageous and left it there. These people have gone too far.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to disagree with some of the things said by the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) when he said that the sugar industry is in favour of this removal. I represent about a quarter of the Australian industry. My colleague the member for Dawson (Mrs De&hyphen;Anne Kelly) and I represent more than half of the industry in Australia. Both of us are opposing these moves tonight. Clearly we would not be doing that if the industry was in favour of these moves. So I must disagree with his statements. He said that there were two grower representatives on the review. One of those grower representatives has changed his position in the meantime. What is more, those growers only made that decision because they had the gun of deregulation at their head. That is a point that cannot be overemphasised in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Adding to what I said previously this evening, there are two models&mdash;the Australian economic model and the Japanese economy model. In Japan, the trade balance last year was a $131,000 million surplus, the biggest trade surplus recorded in world history. Japan is a country that does not work on the policy of abolishing tariffs. It is a country that works on just the opposite policy of doing everything humanly possible to defend and develop industries. It seems to me that we have a policy that is just the opposite. To put a $131,000 million trade surplus into perspective, the United States last year recorded a $106,000 million deficit. The average income for Japan working on a policy of aggressive trade policies&mdash;the non&hyphen;removal of tariffs and doing everything humanly possible to protect and defend their workers and the workers' 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> industries&mdash;is $37,050 per year. The average income in the United States is $26,590 per year. I would be embarrassed to tell the House what this country's average income is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us go back in Australian history. The honourable member for Dawson has a very large picture of John McEwan up in her office and I most certainly will be getting one myself shortly. In 1972, unemployment in this country&mdash;the last year of John McEwan&mdash;was 2.2 per cent. In 1996, it was 8.9 per cent. The current account deficit was a $403 million surplus.

Departmental estimates are that approximately 40% of these determinations were made on the application alone (no interview). Case officers are instructed to make a strategic decision about whether or not an interview is required to clarify gaps or inconsistencies presented in the claims. Although there are fewer applicants currently being interviewed, the Department is still interviewing a substantial proportion of the caseload. As illustrated in the specific examples at (2), not interviewing does not presage a negative outcome.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) As at 30 June 1997 there were 1129 cases before the Department of Immigration and Multi 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cultural Affairs (DIMA) concerning an approach for me to exercise my discretion under s.417 of the Migration Act 1958 and substitute for a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal, a decision which is more favourable to the applicant if I think it is in the public interest to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) On 2 March 1996 DIMA had before it 31 cases. The reason for the increase is twofold. Prior to the 1996 Federal election every effort was made to finalise outstanding requests for Ministerial intervention. Secondly, on 14 May 1996, Justice Merkel of the Federal Court handed down a decision in the Ozmanian case. The findings in this case went to the heart of the administration of my public interest powers. I appealed this decision. Further action on requests was deferred until the impact on administrative procedures was examined and further procedures were developed. Processing of cases did not recommence until 19 September 1996. During this period a large backlog of requests developed. In addition, there has been a significant rise in the number of requests for Ministerial intervention received in the last 12 to 18 months. This is probably, in part, because of the delay in processing requests which occurred as a result of Ozmanian, including dealing with the backlog. All requests seeking my intervention are now personally-seen by me.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7607">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Work for the Dole projects will not require participants to undergo a significant amount of vocational training. To make sure participants are working safely some project sponsors may need to provide training in the areas of occupational health and safety. Of course, sponsors will provide any training that participants need to undertake the duties of the project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The initiative will provide long term benefits to participants. Participating in Work for the Dole projects will help young people to maintain and develop their work ethic and reduce the impact unemployment has on self esteem and confidence. The initiative will provide participants with a valuable link to the community that supports them and will provide individuals with continuing assistance from the community. The work experience gained on the projects should foster a stronger attachment to the labour force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) I have received some information about the Alberta Job Corps.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The objectives of Work for the Dole and the Alberta Job Corps are different. The Alberta scheme aims to reduce participants' dependence on welfare by providing job training and life skills instruction. Work for the Dole offers young people a chance to participate in community projects and thus contribute to their communities in return for their unemployment allowances. By doing this Work for the Dole aims to bring young people back to a work culture and help to develop a work ethic, self esteem and confidence. The initiative aims to engage young unemployed people and their communities and offers benefits to both. Work for the Dole, is not designed to reduce social security outlays nor create employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I expect the initiative to be successful in benefiting both young unemployed people and their communities. The Government will conduct an evaluation of the success of the Work for the Dole pilot projects in meeting these objectives.</PARA>

<ANSWER PAGE="7612" SPEAKER="Downer, Alexander, MP" NAMEID="4G4" ELECTORATE="Mayo" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Foreign Affairs" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4G4">Mr Downer</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) I have taken a close interest in Mr de Robillard's case. On 27 March 1997, Mr de Robillard was sentenced to two months imprisonment in Vanuatu for contempt of court. He subsequently lodged an appeal against his sentence, which was heard by a specially convened Appeal Court on 5 and 6 May. That Court quashed Mr de Robillard's conviction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) When an Australian citizen is arrested overseas my Department undertakes as an established consular practice to inform next&hyphen;of&hyphen;kin of the arrest, or else another nominated person if the citizen in question does not wish his next&hyphen;of&hyphen;kin to be informed. Following his arrest on 26 March 1997, Mr de Robillard was provided with the Department's standard consular advice letter, which included that advice, by the Consul in Port Vila. Mr de Robillard informed the Consul that his next&hyphen; 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">of&hyphen;kin were already aware of his situation, but requested that a legal colleague in Australia be notified in order to arrange his legal representation. It was explained to Mr de Robillard that in circumstances where next&hyphen;of&hyphen;kin had been informed of an arrest, the Department would not normally contact other parties. The Department considers next&hyphen;of&hyphen;kin better placed than itself in notifying other non&hyphen;family members of information relating to a person arrested overseas. Next&hyphen;of&hyphen;kin can better judge whom the individual overseas would want contacted beyond the immediate family, and similarly, how much information to disseminate. Accordingly, the Department treats next&hyphen;of&hyphen;kin as a central point for dissemination of information about an Australian overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr de Robillard noted that he had instructed his secretary in Australia to advise his lawyers of his arrest, but took the view that the terms of the consular letter, strictly construed, entitled him to ask that the Consul contact someone other than his next&hyphen;of&hyphen;kin. The Consul agreed to pass Mr de Robillard's request to the Department in Canberra. Later that day&mdash;the day immediately before the Easter break&mdash;officers of my Department attempted to telephone the person nominated by Mr de Robillard, but there was no answer. The Department made contact with the person on the morning immediately following the Easter break.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The High Commissioner, Mr Edwards, his staff in Vanuatu and the Department in Canberra were extremely active in their efforts to assist Mr de Robillard. The High Commissioner was informed of Mr de Robillard's arrest at approximately 10 p.m. on 26 March 1997. The High Commissioner in turn advised the Australian Consul, Mr Brims. Subsequent to the phonecall from Mr Edwards, Mr Brims contacted the Central Police Station and spoke to the Deputy Police Officer, who confirmed that Mr de Robillard had been arrested and was being held there. The officer refused to allow the Consul to speak with Mr de Robillard on the telephone, noting the late hour, and advised Mr 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7613"> Brims that he should visit in person the next morning and speak to the Inspector in Charge. Mr Brims agreed to do so, and the officer agreed to pass a message to Mr de Robillard that Mr Brims would visit him early the next morning. Mr Brims visited Mr de Robillard at the Central Police Station in Port Vila at 9:00 a.m. the next morning, 27 March 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following Mr de Robillard's arrest, the staff of the High Commission made a number of representations to the relevant authorities, to express consular interest in his case, to encourage the holding of an early appeal, and to raise the question of a possible early release to facilitate the preparation of his case for the appeal hearing. Those contacted included the Prime Minister of Vanuatu, the Minister for Justice, the Attorney&hyphen;General, and a number of senior officials. In addition, officers of the Department in Canberra spoke directly with Mr de Robillard on a number of occasions concerning the handling of the case. The Head of the Consular Response Group was sent to Port Vila from 19 to 23 April to assist the High Commission with the handling of the case. While there, this officer called twice on Mr de Robillard, spending a total of nearly three hours with him. Further, when the prison authorities sought to impose conditions more in keeping with those applicable to his fellow Ni&hyphen;Vanuatu prisoners, the Mission interceded and assisted in restoring the food and telephone access privileges previously enjoyed by Mr de Robillard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) As far as my Department is aware there are no outstanding charges against Mr de Robillard. As noted earlier, the charges relating to contempt of court were quashed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) Mr de Robillard was allowed independent legal representation and a team of lawyers travelled to Vanuatu from Australia to represent Mr de Robillard at the appeal hearing. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade sought advice from the Vanuatu Supreme Court regarding the necessary procedures for Mr de Robillard's counsel to obtain a temporary practising certificate for the appeal hearing. This advice was passed to Mr de Robillard's counsel.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Two draft Optional Protocols to the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child (the Convention) are currently being negotiated by Working Groups of the United Nations Commission for Human Rights (CHR).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first Protocol will cover the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography. At its 1994 session, CHR established a Working Group to develop this draft Optional Protocol. The Protocol aims to give greater definition to the obligations contained in Articles 34 and 35 of the Convention, which require States parties to protect children from sexual exploitation (including prostitution and pornography), sale, trafficking and abduction.
