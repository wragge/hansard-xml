<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is unusual to have debate on a motion like this and it is particularly unusual to get opposition from the member for Canberra to a capital work in the ACT. Particularly given what this government has done to the economy of the ACT, you would think I would be on my bended knee, saying, `Thank you. They are at least going to spend $185,000 in my constituency.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Everybody in Canberra agrees there are myriad better ways that $185,000 could be spent on refurbishing work on innumerable buildings in the ACT. Many public servants working in substandard conditions in the ACT could testify to a much more socially worthwhile use of the money in every building around town than that being proposed for this indulgence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To spend $185,000 to adjust the parapets of one of Canberra's most historic public buildings just to provide a more pleasant view for a few is ridiculous. At a time when tough decisions are being made&mdash;some correct tough decisions; some ridiculous tough decisions&mdash;this is an indulgence that is not warranted. It is a clear example of wrong priority.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is just absurd to say in the difficult budgetary times Australia always faces&mdash;there is nothing unusual about them; we face them now and always&mdash;that to be prudent and rigorous in the expenditure of public moneys a priority for this government is to spend $185,000 on adjusting the parapets on the administrative building in Parkes in which people have worked without the parapets adjusted since the building was opened. This is not some new crisis. We have not just discovered that the parapets are there. They have actually been there since the building was built. So, first and foremost, it is a case of wrong priorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to take a lot of time on this because obviously there are more important things before the parliament and the real debate on this will take place in the Senate when it is subsequently presented. But there is another point: the Australian Heritage Commission is seriously concerned about the national heritage implications of these changes to this building. It contends that this is something which should not be done, and it has advised accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that the National Capital Authority, the Domestic Property Group and their architects have sought to accommodate this concern. At least since July the Heritage Commission have been making their concerns obvious and apparent and drawing them to the attention of the government. At the end of the day, an unsatisfactory solution has been come up with. We cannot always accommodate the concerns of the Australian Heritage Commission. We have to look at, as the act says, prudent and feasible alternatives. In this case there is a prudent, feasible, $185,000 cheaper alternative, which is not to do the work, leave the building as it is. Prudent, yes; feasible, obviously. As to whether the building can operate like that, yes, it can&mdash;it has since the day it was opened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, this is a $185,000 indulgence. If the Minister for Regional Development, Territories and Local Government (Mr Somlyay) would like to come to me for a series of 10 suggestions of a better way to spend $185,000 in my constituency, I would

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government ought to be ashamed of itself for what it is proposing here: as the member for Canberra (Mr McMullan) said, $185,000 to improve the view of a few. He was being generous in saying that because it really involves only a couple. If the Minister for Regional Development, Territories and Local Government (Mr Somlyay) looked at the photographs that his own department have provided, he would see from those photographs that this $185,000 is about improving the view from two end offices.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the minister went down and had a look at this building himself, he would see on the front and rear facades of this building that there are numerous rooms with views. In fact, he does not even need to go all the way down there to look at the building. He can look at the pictures that his own department have provided with the brief on this issue. Looking at those pictures, we can see that up on the top floor of this building there are 12 rooms with views. But the poor people who have the end rooms do not have a view, and the government is to spend $185,000 fixing it up.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My colleague from Western Australia, Mr Filing, thinks that is all right. He thinks the government ought to waste $185,000 on providing a couple of highly paid public servants with a view. And they would not just be ordinary little public servants; they might even be the minister's own SES people, for all we know. My colleague might want to have a look at this and find out what stupidity he is voting for here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the member for Canberra has said, there are far more things in this city that the government should spend money on than this. In this city, the government is creating mass unemployment among public servants but, at the same time, it is willing to spend $185,000 looking after the bosses&mdash;sack the rest, but provide the precious two or three with a better view. This might be part of the government's plan, as we have seen in the papers in recent weeks, to try to prop up the Canberra property market by mothballing some office build 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ings and by knocking others down, but I have never seen anyone accept such stupidity from the Public Service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a report here in which the Domestic Property Group people say that the reason they have got to do this work is that people will not rent this very large five&hyphen; or six&hyphen;storey building because two offices do not have a view.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4I4">Mr LEO McLEAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Hello, he is sitting there. Unfortunately, Minister Somlyay, the previous minister has sold you a pup. I have no doubt that he is sitting in here next to you today to make sure that this pup gets put through this place, because when he was the minister he was of a mind to run this proposal before the parliament but then he pulled it out at the last minute. While he is sitting there next to you he might want to tell you why he pulled it out at the last minute&mdash;because he realised that spending $185,000 for a view from two offices was very hot and very, very stupid. That is a lot of money. Minister Smith baulked at it. You had enough trouble on your plate, didn't you, Warwick? You were not going to be mug enough, Warwick, to run this up the flagpole, so you waited and you gave it to poor Alex. And you did not tell Minister Somlyay what the real problem was with this little plan. You did not show him the pictures; you did not take him down there and say, `Now, listen, Alex, this is a red hot issue. They're going to be on to the fact that we're spending $185,000 to fix up a couple of offices for a couple of very highly paid public servants.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a little bit of a story here from the property group that says it cannot rent the building. Don't go and ask any real estate agent whether he has ever been unable to rent a building because it did not have a view; that is a joke. If it happened anywhere else we would have a laugh about it. But, in this city where the government is causing mass unemployment and reducing services to people, coming up with a proposal like this is really stupid. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10889">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that the best thing the minister could do is to have another closer look at this&mdash;to go down and give the people in the Domestic Property Group a nice little touch&hyphen;up and ask them where they get this stupidity from. If a real estate agent cannot rent or sell government property which is in one of the best positions in this city because two of the offices have not got a view, they ought to get rid of the real estate agent. Any member who wants to actually go and do something about it at lunchtime today can go for a five&hyphen;minute walk down the hill here and have a look at this building&mdash;it is a magnificent building on a beautiful site. This is a government that believes in free enterprise and giving the private sector a go. I would say that, in this case, they ought to go and ask the real estate people. But maybe someone is in a fix here, because if you cannot rent this building without fixing up these views you ought to get the sack.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Maybe the people who are involved in this have got some ulterior motive, but I think that what the government is putting forward here is $185,000 worth of absolute waste. They are going to damage a building that is a rather attractive building. If the people who are renting the building want a view, all you have got to do, Minister, is to go down and have a look at it and you will see&mdash;it is a very nice building; there is a picture of it in your own brief&mdash;that up the top here there are 14 views along the front and 14 views along the back.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is just absurd. It is absolute stupidity, absolute irresponsibility and an absolute waste of money. The minister ought to rethink this. He ought to have a talk to the people in the Domestic Property Group whose job it is to go and market government property and he ought to ask them why they are not doing their job properly. If this is an example of how they do their job, then the member for Fadden (Mr Jull), when he was minister, should have had a good look at it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister Smith certainly realised&mdash;Warwick, you have a good antenna, old son&mdash;that this was a problem. This was nearly as big a problem as the problems you have with nursing homes, Warwick. So you got rid of this real quick. You pulled this out; you did not put this up before the parliament. A couple of weeks ago, when this was supposed to come up, you pulled it out because you realised how stupid it was. You have been very wicked; you have come down here this morning to sit next to Minister Somlyay and watch him make a mug of himself. That is not fair and you should not have done it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to Minister Somlyay: have another look at this. What the member for Canberra said was right. This is an excessive indulgence. It is going to provide a room with a view for two, and the government should not go ahead with it.</PARA></SPEECH>

This motion is to facilitate minor works on the parapets of the administrative building to increase the natural light into the fourth floor. The work follows on from the allocation by the previous Labor government of $2.9 million in the 1994-95 budget to fund design and feasibility studies into the refurbishment of the old administrative building. The major work will be funded off budget and will provide consolidated office accommodation for the two new tenants, the Department of the Environment and the Department of Finance and Administration.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They were made under the Labor government. The feasibility studies made it clear that the fourth floor could not be rented to a standard commercial quality without an increase in the amount of natural light. The lack of natural light also presents a problem with occupational health. The refitting includes the removal of two layers of sandstone blocks. These blocks will be reused to replace decaying stone on other parts of the facade. The fourth floor has been used by a very high security area of Foreign Affairs and the parapets were left there for that purpose. It was a high security area and the windows had to be protected from intrusion from the outside.

I would like to inform the House that I in fact worked in that building for three years back in the 1960s. When Senator Faulkner made his outrageous allegations in the Senate that this was John Howard's $185,000 view, I went to inspect the building, I walked over each floor, I had a look at the parapets and I decided that it was fully justified to remove those parapets. If I were the client, the first

The cost of removing the two layers of bricks will be more than offset by increased rents and savings in the electricity lighting.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the completion of play last night I was commenting on the comments by the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) on the Working Nation package and its relative merits to the great progress of the new government and reminding the House of the youth allowance and the various programs that it is replacing. It also replaces Austudy for students commencing study when aged between 16 and 24, as well as more than minimum family payment for secondary students aged 16 to 18 not receiv 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="10891"> ing Austudy. The reform will reduce complexity and duplication by creating a single youth payment. It clears up confusion between DEETYA and DSS and reduces the huge number of payment levels. It recognises the obligation we all have to support our children until they have achieved financial independence. The reforms are to commence on 1 July 1998.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Until now, the complexity of the youth payment system has been of significant disadvantage to parents and young people. What is more, the system has inadvertently led to significant educational and employment problems for young unemployed Australians. It is well known that those who leave school early are three times more likely to be unemployed than those who complete their education. It seems absurd then that past policy actively encouraged young Australians to join the dole queue rather than to participate in education or training. This contributed to a youth unemployment level that became quite intolerable during the Keating-Beazley recession, when 34.9 per cent of young Australians could not find work. This was at the same time as the number of apprenticeships and traineeships fell to its lowest level in three decades. The  Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) Bill 1997  sets out to remedy the problems associated with the previous payments system and, as a consequence, contributes to the solution of the scourge of youth unemployment in partnership with the government's other reforms in the areas of literacy, vocational education and employment services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By introducing a flexible, inclusive income support program for young people now, Australia will be better equipped to deal with future trends in education, training and the labour market. Under the youth allowance, youth aged between 18 and 20 who find themselves unemployed will be subject to a parental means test if they wish to obtain an allowance. Those young unemployed will be treated in the same manner as full-time students. As such, families will be required to support their children until they have achieved financial independence if they can afford to do so. The payments available to those under 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 18 years of age whose circumstances mean that they have to live away from home for work or study will be increased and rent assistance extended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Importantly, the youth allowance has been designed to overcome many of the failings of the past system that have impacted so unfairly on students in rural and regional areas. This has been an issue close to the hearts of all parents and students, particularly my own heart, representing the seat of Grey and having four children, much of their education away from home. It is estimated that around 70,000 young people from outside metropolitan Australia will now be eligible for benefits previously denied to them. The previous system's education leaver waiting period will be abolished. This move will ensure that young people in need of income support do not face delays of up to three months in the provision of that support. The independence criteria that waive the parental means test will be made more realistic. In turn, new safety net criteria will ensure that young people over 18 who have work force experience are not disadvantaged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a move that will benefit many parents and students, particularly those in my electorate, the minimum Austudy payment of $1,000 per annum will be abolished. To address the previous incentives to opt out of work and training, flexible activity test requirements are introduced in this legislation. These requirements will mean that young people are encouraged to stay in education, while still allowing for support for those for whom full-time schooling not an appropriate option. Furthermore, the youth allowance is a genuine reform that will benefit the vast majority of young Australians. At this time about 560,000 young people are likely to claim youth allowance. Over 153,750 of those young Australians will receive more through the youth allowance than they do currently. It is estimated that another 358,600 will receive the same amount they did previously. Those numbers speak for themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I come to what the youth allowance is not. I would like to consider now what I believe is a very worrying development in Australian public life. It is a development that has been 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10892"> highlighted by debate on this bill. At a time when Australia faces some extraordinary challenges&mdash;the levels of poverty and unemployment that this generation has inherited from the Labor economic downturn, the slow death of rural Australia at the hands of native title and its ignorant defenders&mdash;this nation requires innovative and courageous reforms. Yet innovative and courageous policies, including this bill, are now regularly and bitterly attacked by the ALP, by some church employees, by trade unions and by journalists who are too lazy to believe anything other than what their fellow travellers tell them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There can only be one conclusion about opposition to this bill&mdash;those who oppose this bill, such as those members opposite, support young people dropping out of school and going on the dole. That is a plain fact. Labor believes that it is better to condemn young Australians, particularly young Australians from rural and regional areas, to a life of impoverishment and depression than offer them real choices, real alternatives, like education and training. That is a mind-numbing stance. After all, I can still remember when Labor at least pretended to have an interest in the welfare of less fortunate Australians. Perhaps there was a time when Labor regarded the seat of Grey as a safe seat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today the ALP is simply the mouthpiece of the failed radicals and anarchists of the chardonnay set, unionists who have never stepped on to the factory floor in their life, and those whose genuine concern has long since been undermined by cynicism. Their opposition to this bill is entirely ideological. It has no basis in fact, just as the allegations about vocational education funding made by the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) have no resemblance to truth. As the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Dr Kemp) has already reminded the House, this government is not simply funding vocational education in a more central manner driven by the needs of young people rather than the needs of public servants, but is funding it to a greater extent. Funding is up $144 million compared with the last year of the previous government. Apprenticeships and traineeships last year alone were up to 98,000, 20 per cent 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> more than under Labor. The youth allowance is not a savings measure. Additional program costs are expected to be around $25 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation does not pretend to have all the answers to youth unemployment. What it does promise is a new payment system geared to the needs of young people and their families which recognises that as Australians our first responsibility is to our children, that we all have the responsibility of ensuring that their needs are met.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further to the Labor Party's criticism of our reform process, I would remind them that in January 1995, when they were in government, they introduced the youth training allowance. Young people aged 16 to 17, either unemployed or in training, and certain 15-year-olds became eligible for the youth training allowance rather than the jobsearch allowance. There were three categories for the youth training allowance. There was the home rate, the away from home rate, that is, living away from home to undertake training or job search approved by the Commonwealth Employment Service, and the independent rate, including homeless. So back in June 1995 the Labor Party were already moving to this sort of process. Yet they stand in this place and criticise our legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To conclude, I draw on a few comments from a well-known overseas Prime Minister:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fact is that if we cannot solve the debt problem that we have inherited&mdash;the national debt doubled in the past six years&mdash;then those at the bottom of the heap will lose out just as much as everyone else.</PARA>

But I would warn him against quoting from Tony Blair, the new Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, in relation to employment or training programs, because Tony Blair is, in actual fact, quite an ardent supporter of Working Nation. Therefore, I would find his support as being obviously highly conditional.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At some stage in the future, other members of the coalition may have cause to regret quoting or using Tony Blair as a role model. I certainly would because, as a fellow Old Granthamian, I am a very ardent fan of the former Prime Minister bar one of the United Kingdom, Mrs Thatcher, who did a good job. Tony Blair's government is building on the changes that were made during those periods of government&mdash;changes that obviously fundamentally altered Britain's structure and made Britain a more competitive and dynamic country and a country able to participate more fully in the world economy in that competitive environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will make a couple of observations, if I may, in relation to the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) enabling legislation. First of all, I would like to commend the government on this legislation. I think there are obviously a number of changed circumstances in our society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday, I was speaking in the debate on the Community Affairs Committee report on youth suicide, mentioning the most recent sociological research work of Hugh Mackay; his new book, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Generations</EMPHASIS>, looks at the three generations that comprise the majority of the population in Australia: the boomers; the predecessors of the boomers, what he calls the luckies; and, more recently, what he calls the options generation, who, of course, would be those who would be most affected by this legislation. It is interesting to note that one of the things Hugh Mackay points out when discussing these types of issues with people who are in the options generation, as he calls 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10894"> them, is the sort of impression they get that our generation&mdash;probably comprising the majority age group of parliamentarians&mdash;tends to look for solutions that we feel comfortable with to problems for the other generation; in other words, trying to make changes to social problems based on preconceptions and, in some cases, misconceptions that we may have had through our own particular experiences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As those in my generation would know, of course, in the early part of our working lives, in this country, there was full employment. So there was obviously far greater opportunity at that time. Then things deteriorated, more or less coinciding with the election of the Whitlam government, and have not got much better since&mdash;although in recent times there has been a marked decrease in unemployment. But the youth sector of the unemployed is the largest proportionally. For any person in public affairs, the fact that a section of the community carries such a disproportionate high level of unemployment is a matter of grave concern, and a matter that would require urgent remedial action on the part of any government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous government, the Keating government, addressed these problems with a plethora of training programs that, in many instances, were expensive, ill directed and often leading to the disappointment of the people concerned, the participants, finding that, after they had participated in a particular program, they suddenly found themselves back out in the wasteland of the unemployed. That is the overwhelming perception of a lot of the programs that were in the Working Nation policy announcement and other predecessor programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this country education and training are obviously keys to higher employment rates. There is no doubt, as the member for Grey pointed out, that those youngsters who leave school at an earlier stage find themselves with proportionately higher rates of unemployment than those who complete their secondary education or go on to tertiary education. There is a need in this particular instance to look at a longer term solution. Short&hyphen;term fixes such as short-term training programs, which prove to be expensive and in many 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> instances counterproductive, do not offer a solution. In the short term they provide, perhaps, an immediate boost to employment figures or they may reduce the numbers of people registered as looking for work. But in the final analysis they lead to a greater sense of exasperation and lack of self&hyphen;worth in those who were desperately looking for work in the first place and undertook those programs in good faith only to find themselves in a position where, at the conclusion of the program, they were unable to get gainful long&hyphen;term, full&hyphen;time employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This particular bill is part of a comprehensive reform that is long overdue. On the face of it, it appears to have a number of protections and safety net provisions that go to addressing some of the concerns of those who are related to these young people or who are in the same position themselves. One of the problems we have to look at is the relationship between those unemployed youngsters and their families. Philosophically the coalition would like to see families support young people until they have achieved financial independence. That is all very well, but unfortunately in some instances we are finding that, in the practical application of government policy by the people responsible, policies can be counterproductive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can cite a couple of examples in my electorate where the Department of Social Security has contributed to assisting young people to leave their families&mdash;in one particular case in circumstances that were quite distressing; in fact, it would lead one to conclude that the people responsible for making the social security payments in the circumstances that occurred were trying desperately to assist the break up of this particular family. The Minister for Family Services (Mr Warwick Smith), who is at the table, and the coalition government must ensure&mdash;and this is an effort&mdash;that there is a comprehensive integrated approach to these types of programs so that there is not a counterproductive effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday, when talking in the Main Committee about youth suicide, I mentioned a situation where a desperate father with a suicidal daughter had sought psychiatric help 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10895"> for his daughter. He found that if he were to try to get Medicare, public funded health care or psychiatric assistance for his daughter he would have to wait nine months. In the private sector he would have to wait six weeks. He then found that he could not get medical benefit rebates for those sessions and that Medicare only paid for the first $110.11 of a program that would cost around $87 per hour. Here is a case where the government has good intentions in trying to address another facet of the problems of young people, the very serious problem of youth suicide&mdash;another problem stemming from the lack of self&hyphen;worth and the feeling of exasperation and desperation with one's lot&mdash;yet the practical application of government policy was working against the family that loved the particular person who was susceptible to suicidal tendencies. They were unable to get that help without an extraordinary amount of expense. Here was a loving father desperately seeking help and finding the government was impeding the opportunity to address that particular serious and distressing problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the most common complaints from parents is that the government has, certainly up until recent times, offered too much incentive for young people to drop out of education and training and go onto the dole. We have seen in recent times, in articles and in the sorts of vox pop programs you see in things like <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Current Affair</EMPHASIS>, continual examples of people who are looking at unemployment benefits as a career option. People see themselves as leading a life where they can pursue their own particular pleasures or pursuits, such as surfing or other things, in the knowledge that they would have a guaranteed income through unemployment benefits or jobsearch allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation is well thought out and it is integrated into a package which should go some way to alleviate this problem&mdash;not all the way but some of the way. Young people who leave education or training early are three times as likely to be unemployed, as the member for Grey pointed out, than those who stay on longer. So I applaud the government's determination to try to remove disincentives for young people to further their education 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and training. I agree strongly with Dr Kemp that the income support system gives young people a misleading message that the unemployment benefit, the dole, is an automatic alternative to school or training. If the allowance does send the right message that the best way to a job is through education or training then that is an effective way of trying to create a shift in attitude.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not understand, though, why the government has restricted the concept applied to the youth allowance to young people. The difficulty is that there is a feeling amongst young people that they are getting singled out for special treatment. Admittedly you could argue that that is because they are carrying such a disproportionately high level of unemployment. At the same time, if you were to look at Hugh Mackay's observations on the most recent generation's view of their position in the world, one of the things that comes through quite strongly in that work is that young people are looking to be viewed as independent. They like to be seen as independent and self&hyphen;determinant rather than as being pushed around or directed into things that they feel compelled to do. That is something that governments should be aware of because any particular policy that acts as a big stick rather than offering incentives is obviously going to detract from the support of the very people it is trying to serve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe the basis for tying social security payments to seeking self&hyphen;improvement or employment for young people is equally applicable to all Australians. There is good cause to believe that many other Australians who find themselves unemployed would appreciate that particular direction in the application of social security payments to support people who are unable to find full&hyphen;time work. We are in danger of discriminating against Australians who are over 25 years of age by not giving them access and encouragement in the same way as we are proposing here for young people. Bear in mind that some of the people who are most heavily affected by unemployment are in my age group, between the ages of, say, 38 and around 55. These are people who also find it extraordinarily difficult if they lose their work 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10896"> to get back into the work force. It is another area requiring urgent consideration by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were some programs established under the previous government. There is a particular organisation called DOME that has done some tremendous work in encouraging people of an older age group, in middle age, back into the work force. The new enterprise incentive scheme, a program that was designed to encourage people into their own small business, was another successful program of the previous government. Ironically, it was singled out for being chopped down at the time of Working Nation until there was a huge outcry from the people in the area of training and employment opportunities, who understood why NEIS was so successful and how it was working successfully to get people into their own small businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The integrated approach between payments of the allowance and the creation of additional approaches, TAFE places and training is a commendable strategy which should not be restricted to young people. I know the government hopes to break the unemployment cycle by concentrating on giving people the best chance of remaining employed throughout their whole working life, but they must do more for people who are past their youth. In other words, we want to try to give those people the opportunity of going back and getting training so that they are in a position to re&hyphen;enter the work force in circumstances that allow them the best possible choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of the main provisions of the bill go to the application of the new youth allowance. There is a requirement for satisfaction of the activity test. There is obviously a need for meeting the youth allowance age requirements: older than 16, or 15 if independent, and under 25. This brings me to one of the problems which I think has arisen in the replacement of the Austudy provisions with the youth allowance, and that is this use of the 25&hyphen;year age barrier for independence. That particular age was not singled out for any scientific purposes. It was not an age that people decided was a mean age for people becoming independent of their parents. The only reason they used the age 25 is because 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the ALP had used it in a previous incarnation and they thought they could get away with it. So there is no rhyme or reason to it and as an arbitrary age threshold it does not make sense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that members opposite, when they have constituents coming to them with particular concerns, will find themselves having to explain to their constituents, if they are members of the government, exactly why they have chosen the age 25. I can tell you of situations in my constituency, where there are a large number of people who operate market gardens or small farms or orchards, of people going down to the department and being told that they could not possibly live on the income that they had quoted as being their income for the purposes of qualifying for the youth allowance, and being told basically that they were liars. These are people who are thrifty and who are probably the sort of people you would want to encourage in the community because they look after themselves and manage to economise on their living arrangements, yet they were being told they were dishonest. They were distressed and were coming to me as their local member asking how it is that they could be told that, because they were actually frugal and able to live on a lot less than perhaps other people were able to, they were being dishonest in making their declarations of income for the purposes of the income test.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the arbitrary use of the age 25, I predict that there will be large numbers of people, decent people from middle and lower income backgrounds, who will come to the members of parliament in the coalition and ask them exactly why this arbitrary age was chosen and why it is that their particular circumstances are ruled out. This is a problem with having an arbitrary limit like that, that you will find large numbers of people who will make that particular provision seem unjust because of their own particular circumstances. I just hope that there is going to be some opportunity for rational adjustment here, because I can see this becoming a serious problem for coalition members in marginal seats. These will be people from the natural constituency of the Liberal Party. These are parents raising teenagers or young adults who 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10897"> are studying in tertiary institutions. They are people who are not on big incomes, and this is the great problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can recollect clearly from the days when I was in the coalition that when we were debating the Fightback program there were some changes made in Fightback version 2 which on the face of it appeared to be reasonable, but then suddenly you realised that they were going to make people who were on what I would call low or moderate income levels raising children, in many instances on single incomes, worse off. They are your natural constituency. The trouble is that they see themselves as victims of government policy because they are desperately trying to do the right thing&mdash;to make their sons and daughters able to participate in the work force fully, sacrificing all sorts of things that they could otherwise have in their households to pay for their youngsters to go through university. They are looking forward to some assistance, because some of them are on such low incomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bear in mind that the threshold levels for the incomes are in area of the low $30,000s per annum. That is not a large amount of money; when you are feeding, clothing and sheltering two or three young adults, that is almost living on a subsistence level. This is a problem, and I advise members in marginal seats that they should start preparing themselves for the problems that will come as a result of the application of these tests. I can assure you they will come, and these people who would normally vote for you might find themselves actually changing their minds if you are not careful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make an observation about an area in my own electorate in which we are having some serious problems: that is, market gardening and small farming. My farmers, market gardeners and orchardists find it almost impossible to get a work force. It is incredible that, at a time when we have such large scale unemployment, when they advertise for workers to come and do the sorts of jobs that I suppose some might consider to be menial but which nonetheless are an important part of our concept of being a supermarket to Asia&mdash;because these are export industries; 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> they are exporting vegetables and fruit to our neighbours in the Asian region&mdash;they cannot find the work force necessary to pick and pack it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, the disincentive for people to take those jobs is that they can just as easily get the jobsearch allowance. In some ways there is a slight contradiction in the direction of this policy. On the one hand, there is an encouragement for people to seek training and education as an alternative to being unemployed or to accepting unemployment payments but, on the other hand, there is perhaps a reinforcement of the concept that important jobs in market gardens in the supermarket to Asia program might be a tad menial or demeaning for people to take. I want to point out that it is critical that we encourage people who are unemployed to look for these types of jobs as well, because they are important. They are part of our great thrust in providing valuable food exports into our region. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe the youth allowance is much more than an income support issue. To explain, I have to go back 20 years, to November 1977, when legislation was passed in the House for school leavers to go on unemployment benefits at the start of the next academic year. This sounded like and looked like a financial kick&hyphen;start; just enough to help teenagers make that important transition from school to work. But for so many it unwittingly established a potentially destructive life pattern. That was, and still is, the reliance on an instant salary; a salary from an employer who asked nothing in return.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The attraction of a regular weekly income without the need to have or to gain any skills offered many an irresistible option. It offered freedom from the discipline of study, for a start, and of course the chance to get out and have a good time with one's mates. When you are young and vibrant, this is an appealing option. For young people in my state of Queensland it means sun and surf. The ease in which young people could launch into their first year in the real world after nearly a decade behind a desk was made easier with a regular government allowance. There is no 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10898"> doubt that it has encouraged many young Australians to leave school prematurely. It has encouraged too many to avoid taking that first hard step into the work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of us forget just how difficult that first year out of school was&mdash;going from a day which ended at around 3 p.m. with weekends free and long holiday breaks throughout the year to a job which would mean a straight 12 months without a holiday break and a longer day of concentrated effort. For many it meant standing up all day after years of sitting behind a desk. For many more it meant no sporting breaks, no interesting school excursions; it meant hard slog until the body and mind adjusted to the new regime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That first unemployment allowance made available to young people who had never been in the work force was a means of putting off finding the first job. It also encouraged many young people to put their further education on hold, be it university, TAFE, an apprenticeship or a traineeship. As a result, the first skill so many young Australians were introduced to when leaving school was that of the art of filling out claim forms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Too few young people realise the value of education until they are well into adulthood. Not too many students are fortunate enough while still at school to discover a career path or an interest which they can develop into a career. The majority leave school with no idea what they are going to do with their lives. Many find it hard to get even the most basic job. Many do not have parents who can assist with their support, and many find it necessary to leave their homes and strike out on their own without funds or skills. Pensions and allowances are vital for these people. But I am concerned that over the past two decades we have also introduced thousands of young Australians to the welfare system&mdash;young people who had not asked for help.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a well recorded fact that, within a decade of the introduction of automatic unemployment benefits to school leavers, the CES at Surfers Paradise on the Queensland Gold Coast produced the highest rate of unemployed on its books per capita in Australia. Leaving home to drop out in Surfers and/or Byron Bay has become a popular 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> lifestyle option for the young. It is not a lifestyle to pave the way to long-term financial independence. It certainly no longer holds any social stigma to have no goal past catching the sun and the waves, and living on the scant unemployment allowance salary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Naturally, within a year or so, these young Australians lose their place on the skills pathway. They become professionally unskilled. In my own circle there is a 27&hyphen;year&hyphen;old single mother who, despite the urging of her concerned parents, chose to take the casual job&mdash;the casual job of unemployment allowance, the support route&mdash;and today is unemployable due to the lack of a work history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She is one who found the allure of a jump in pocket money from $10 a week to nearly $80 a week irresistible. She is one of the many thousands who left school prematurely, not realising, until it was too late, that an unskilled career path would prove far more difficult than a working one. She is one who used that pause for assistance until it slid into a crutch for life. Now she bitterly regrets taking that course.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no shortage of assistance for young people who leave school, but this government is creating more incentives to either stay at school or take on an apprenticeship or traineeship rather than a career of unemployment assistance. The government also says that it will always help young people who find it necessary to leave home and those who have trouble making the transition from school to work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That leads me back to this bill and the reforms it introduces. Now we are finally saying, `Don't rush out of school simply because you can. Take full advantage of the education that is available to you for as long as you possibly can. Do not leave your family and your school in the belief that life is a ball if you are free from restraints and responsibility.' This bill shifts the focus from instant government support to the advantages of education and the advantages of staying close to the family during those vital years after leaving school.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was astounded to read the comments by the opposition spokesman on education, the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10899"> honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), who claims the danger of this bill is that schools are likely to be swamped with extra students. I can think of nothing better. The member for Werriwa is not the only Labor member to be alarmed that this government's action might just result in hundreds of young people staying at school or going back to school to complete their education. The member for Chifley (Mr Price) said that he believed the biggest losers will be young people, both those currently trying to study hard at school and those forced back to school. But let me assure the House: he is wrong, so very wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are school principals and teachers who would be overjoyed if their schools were full to the brim with people wanting to learn. I have seen it in action in my Brisbane electorate of Griffith, where the Principal of Coorparoo Secondary College, Bevan Brennan, has enhanced the curriculum by employing vocational educators. More than that, he has made teachers and classes available to those people who regret leaving school prematurely. The opposition spokesman on education, the member for Werriwa, should have been with me and the Premier of Queensland at the Coorparoo Secondary College speech night last week. He would have seen a celebration of not only final&hyphen;year 16&hyphen; and 17-year-old students but also final&hyphen;year young adults who had come back to finish their high school education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Any young adult who cannot join the regular daily classes at Coorparoo Secondary College can attend night classes. This has been made possible by the dedication of the educators at that college. One of the features of that evening was that over half of those who had graduated from that secondary college were actually adult students. They make up over half of the population of that secondary school.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know why I am surprised at the statements by the members of the opposition condemning encouraging people to stay at school. After all, the Labor Party worked extremely hard to erode our education system to the point where a vast percentage of our students have trouble reading and writing. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Now the Labor Party publicly opposes the notion that young people are better off being educated and staying with their families than out on the streets and on the dole. If the introduction of the youth allowance forces young Australians to finish year 12 while staying at home with their parents, then I believe it is a worthwhile achievement.

It merely confirms the view of the previous Prime Minister that we now have in Australia a government of the great punishers and straiteners of Australian society. The honourable member for Griffith talked about the benefits of education for young people and the importance of young people staying with their families. This is all very admirable stuff, and if you had one iota and one ounce of credibility to make those statements you could get up in this House in all honesty and make them, but let me just put on the record what your government has achieved so far. In education, it has achieved a massive drop in retention rates. That is your achievement. So, when you stand here and lecture us on this side of the House about what the Labor Party in government did to the education system of this country, reflect on your own record in barely 19 months of office.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I withdraw any offensive remarks. The simple fact is that this is the minister who could not lie straight in bed. He comes into this House day after day misrepresenting the situation for Australia's youth and misrepresenting statistics in his own portfolio, and people on the opposition side are expected to just accept this little punisher and straitener who comes to the dispatch box to lecture Australian youth about what they ought to be doing with their lives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, you and I know that the reasons why young people leave school early are very complex. There is a myriad of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reasons. There may be emotional problems that the young person is going through. We know young people are prone to depression at this stage of their lives; they might be having quite extreme emotional difficulties. There might be parental conflicts in the home, and the home maybe a place where the young person cannot live out their life in security because of alcohol and drug abuse or perhaps violence in the home. It might be a case of sexual abuse and the young person has to seriously consider leaving the home. Of course, it might simply be that the young person has run their race at school; they are not suitable at that time of their lives for the sorts of narrow curricula that are being offered by schools which are under constant pressure from Liberal state governments and the federal Liberal government on the resource front.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there is a myriad of reasons why young people find it extremely difficult these days not only to cope in their home environment but also to cope in the school environment. That does not apply to all young people, it applies only to some, but what the punishers and straiteners are saying is that these factors do not exist&mdash;`We will force you back to school and all will be well.' It might be well if resources were provided to schools to enable them to cope with the sorts of problems that have emerged, but that is not the case. In Victoria the public school sector has been cut to pieces by a Liberal state government and the overlay on top of that has been a reduction in resources to those schools by a federal Liberal government as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given that situation, the minister is saying, `We are going to send you a clear message'&mdash;and the honourable member for Griffith repeated the message here today&mdash;`it is better that you go back to school.' He misrepresents the shadow minister's views on this matter: we understand the pressure that these schools are under in coping with the myriad of problems besetting our youth. The schools of today are being asked to perform a task that can only be effected with any degree of efficiency and competency if they are resourced well, but under Liberal governments they are not being resourced well.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10901">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is with a great deal of concern that I listen to members opposite criticising Labor for our achievements in government and our attempts to come to grips with a very complex situation when in office. As far as this government is concerned, this Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill is the end of it all. Their very simple solution is to drive all the children back to school and make a grand assumption that everything is well in their homes. That is not the case. The task of government is to respond in a compassionate and sympathetic way but in a way that is well&hyphen;resourced and acknowledges the very complexity of the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have criticism from all quarters&mdash;saying, for example, `We admire the government's attempts to simplify this legislation but, at the end of the day, it is not coming to grips with this complex situation.'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for Batman says, even the churches are questioning the intent and processes of this piece of legislation. It is okay to say to young people, `Your best place is back at school', but, if you do not resource the schools, you have a problem. In schools in Victoria at the moment we do have a problem. They are under&hyphen;resourced, morale is low and parents are working very hard to find the extra money to send their children to supposedly free schools. Teacher:student ratios have gone up, physical resources are declining and the experienced teachers have been pensioned out of the system. The problem with that is that the corporate memory within the schools has been lost, that vast bank of teaching experience has been lost, and you are leaving schools today with younger staff without expert guidance in winding their way through some of the complex problems our young people are experiencing. That is why morale in the teaching profession, particularly in Victoria, is very low.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wonder if the principals do get plastic cards, like the wife of the Premier of Victoria. If they did, perhaps they could perform this executive function with a greater degree of efficiency. But I think not. That great little punisher and straitener, the minister in charge of this portfolio, wants to turn all our schools into McDonald's stores. He wants a McDonald's in every Victorian school, so that the kids can whip over, have a burger, get a bit of expert training and whip back for the afternoon classes. That might be all right for the little punisher and straitener who claims to be the minister in charge of this portfolio, but schools are very complex institutions. They are different from McDonald's stores and they ought to be funded and treated differently.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We ought to look at the record of the Howard government. We know what the record of the Prime Minister is in this, because the government is claiming, in this debate and in others, that they were left with a mess they had to clean up. That is a story that conservative governments trot out when they will not even examine the facts. The facts of the matter are these: as far as youth unemployment is concerned, in March 1983, when the Prime Minister was Treasurer, the then conservative government left Labor with 158,000 young people unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They come into this chamber with this piece of legislation, crying crocodile tears for the youth of today. When we left office in March 1996 that figure was down to 91,400. You might say, `That is not really a substantial drop.' I would contest that view: it is, in its own right. But it was done at a time of a massive restructuring of private and public sector employment in this country. We were left with an economic system that was ramshackle and run down. We had to refocus and reorientate the economy at a time when technology was being massively introduced and the entry level jobs for our young people were disappearing by the hour and by the day. The entry level jobs&mdash;in the banks and in the typing pools, for example&mdash;were disappearing for our youth. Over that decade, despite the massive change in the economic structure of this country, Labor in government managed 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10902"> to reduce youth unemployment in this country from the disgraceful figure of 158,000 young people out of work in March 1983 to the figure of 91,400 in March, 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members opposite make great play of the fact that it is very important for young people to stay at school. We agree with you. We have no problem with that proposition&mdash;none whatsoever. But, when we look at your record when you were last in government and your record now in government, this is the picture that emerges: in 1983, under the Liberal government of which John Howard was Treasurer, only one in four stayed on until year 12. That was an absolutely appalling and disgraceful situation for an industrialised country that was trying to make it in the global economic environment. Under Labor, we managed to massively increase that retention rate to seven out of 10.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the situation now? Under Mr Howard, who is no longer Treasurer but leads the government as Prime Minister, we have seen retention rates in our schools decline even further. I say to members opposite: if you want to have some credibility when you criticise Labor in government, come to the table with a record of some substance. Do not come to the table with the last Liberal government's retention rate record of one in four and do not come to the table with the declining retention rate of the current Liberal government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The crocodile tears that the government cries for our youth must be seen against the backdrop of what they have done to vocational education and training, what they have done to apprenticeships, what they have done to labour market programs and what they have done to expenditures on education generally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen under the Howard government thus far cuts of 117,000 places in labour market programs that were servicing young people in this country. If you go back to the statistic that I quoted, you will find that the Howard government has cut labour market program places for young people in excess of the actual number of young unemployed people&mdash;that is, they have cut 117,000 places in labour market programs, and when we left 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> office in March 1996 there were 91,400 young people unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have evidence emerging that over the last year apprenticeships have declined by some 2,000 places. When we go to the area of vocational education and training, the government has removed $270 million from that portfolio area. In addition to that, they have drastically reduced the expenditures in education generally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is your record. That is the record that you come to this table and into this House to debate. Do not get up in this place, any of you, and talk about Labor in government and the problems of our youth, because, simply, all you had to do when you came to office, if you are talking about real education and training and real jobs, was two things. First, you had to maintain expenditures in areas where they were being effectively used&mdash;not cut $270 million from our TAFE institutions that were servicing our young people. The second important thing you had to do, as far as education, training and jobs is concerned, was to maintain the flow of full-time jobs to our youth. That was your task.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor left you with an economy running at four per cent annual growth for four years. That is what we left you&mdash;the best scenario that could be achieved at the time that was creating jobs for our young people; that is, when they went through education, when they went through training, there was a job outcome there to some degree.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is your record? In your first budget you admitted defeat on the growth front and the jobs front for our young people. You admitted that you could not bring the Australian economy to a growth rate that Labor left you with. In your first budget you predicted around 3.5 per cent annual growth, and we know you did not even achieve that. Then when it came to your second budget you predicted 3.75 per cent, as I recall, and still you could not even match the target that had been given to you by Labor. When you come to this table in this debate, be very careful of the criticisms that you make.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me quote some opinions on this legislation from youth in Geelong. The Geelong 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10903"> Association of Students have expressed their view very clearly about this bill. They said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed Youth Allowance claims to minimise complexities involved with gaining access to income support. In fact, the scheme will result in increased family conflict, increased youth homelessness, and exacerbated youth poverty. For many young people, the proposed changes represent a complete withdrawal of government assistance.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is their view. The youth in Geelong in my electorate do not think very much of this particular piece of legislation. Of course, youth around this nation do not think very much of it either. That is why it is not being embraced by the young people of this country. That is why it has come in for such heavy criticism from all sectors of the community. It seeks to punish and straiten; it does not seek to come to grips with the very complex issues that are facing our youth today. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Corio talks about the retention rate of the 1990s, but the reason there was such a retention rate over those years was that there were no jobs because we had a massive recession on our hands.

So let us not pussyfoot around and have the members opposite come in here and talk about credibility.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think they will learn their lesson. All I can say to them is that they are wrong because the youth of this country is embracing this piece of legislation that we are talking about today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I rise to speak in support of a coalition government initiative released as part of our first budget. The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) Bill  is among a raft of other programs this government has instigated since coming into office in March 1996 and aims to ensure that all young Australians will have a better and a fairer deal. In practice, the youth allowance, to be introduced from July 1998, will apply to all 16- to 20-year-olds and full-time students until the end of the year they turn 25. The youth allowance is part of this government's commitment to young people, whom I believe to be our greatest asset, and it is this government's greatest challenge. Therefore, I would suggest that it is our first priority to tackle youth unemployment and the issues that surround it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Young people need to have an effective voice in government, and we in the coalition want to improve the government's responsiveness to young people. It is therefore important that we as a government talk and listen to young people. That is a lot more, I would suggest, than the previous government did. That is why before bringing this piece of legislation to the parliament today the coalition made sure that those affected&mdash;and by that I mean young Australians&mdash;were given an opportunity to voice their opinions and to offer their advice on this initiative. In other words, we engaged them in a very wide consultation process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I welcomed the opportunity to address a youth consultation forum in my electorate of Canning, which I did very soon after the announcement of the youth allowance policy. It was a very valuable afternoon spent meeting and discussing this particular initiative with a group of young people. The intelligent and very thoughtful input that was offered by these participants provided me with some very useful advice on how to improve assistance to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10904"> our youth and to of course pass that on to the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has become ever more obvious to me during my visits to training centres, schools, colleges and job clubs in my electorate of Canning is the need for young people to be adequately equipped for a rapidly changing labour market. We live today in a world which is increasingly multiskilled, a world in which demand for unskilled labour is falling and the need for qualifications and training absolutely vital.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think this is a bad thing. With a new world economy becoming increasingly globalised and the rapid change in technology touching everyone, new ideas and new strategies will have to be forged to meet these challenges. However, I do find it of concern that such rampant changes in our labour market have been dealt with so poorly and so inadequately in the past 13 years of Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government recognises its responsibility to ensure that our young people become vital contributors to our society in both an economic and a social sense. We want our young people to have skills and confidence. We want them to have every encouragement to pursue their talents during and after their school lives so they are equipped for the modern work force. When we consider that only 30 per cent of teenagers are in the labour market, it seems obvious that the need to encourage young people in their training and employment skills is absolutely essential. The youth allowance plays a very important part in enabling young people to make that vital transition from school to work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A single youth allowance has a great number of real advantages. At the moment, many young people fall through the gaps due to the inflexibility of the system. The common youth allowance will be far simpler and far more flexible. It will cater for those young people who do not fit neatly into the often confusing categories of various youth and unemployment payments that currently exist. Presently, young people who do not fit into traditional models of either full-time study or full&hyphen;time employment are not having their 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> needs met. They find themselves with no form of income support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure we have all seen and heard the crazy scenario in which students can find themselves better off studying part time and claiming unemployment benefits because of the inadequacies of the present system. The current financial inequity which exists between Austudy and newstart payments can mean that unemployed people decide against taking up training or further study&mdash;not, I would suggest, a very good move. This is a simple but tragic decision for these young people as they cannot afford the loss of money they would experience if they were dependent on Austudy, particularly with respect to the lack of rent assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have had many young people make representations to me about the dilemma they face in wanting to study but being unable to afford it, or in being unable to study part time and work part time because they receive no other assistance. This system, left for our children by the previous Labor government, obviously has to change. It is not flexible enough to suit young people's diverse needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Howard government understands that for some young people the patterns of the past where full-time study would immediately lead to full-time employment may not perhaps become a reality. According to 1997 figures from the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling, part&hyphen;time employment of young people aged between 15 to 25 has grown from 23 per cent in 1978 to 29 per cent in 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The youth allowance will remove present incentives for young people to leave education. No longer will there be any discrimination for young people to invest in their future by choosing to educate themselves. I must have different types of people living in my electorate to that of the member for Corio, because many people, many parents, have come to me and highlighted why it is&mdash;they cannot understand; indeed they question me&mdash;that a person can be unemployed and get government assistance and not be encouraged to look for better rewards, better training or better skills, and yet people who do try to get themselves educated and do try to get training 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10905"> are actually penalised and do not get that sort of assistance. All I can say is that the member for Corio is very wrong and is living in some sort of fairyland that perhaps some of us have not yet discovered.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NL6">Mrs JOHNSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In a time warp he may well be. To qualify for the youth allowance, a young person will have to carry out an approved activity, such as full-time study or jobsearch, voluntary work or another approved activity, or he or she will have to carry out a combination of approved activities which are equivalent to a full&hyphen;time activity load or else be temporarily exempt from these requirements, such as through illness or caring for an elderly relative. Approved courses are generally evaluated in the same way as those approved for Austudy. This combination of activity load has a number of benefits for young people. It means that they have an opportunity to be flexible in their work and to study. Again, I think that is an admirable thing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another measure of the new youth allowance is the introduction of the income bank. Full&hyphen;time students will have access to the income bank. Through this, they can save unused portions of their fortnightly free area, which has been extended to $230 per fortnight up to a maximum balance of $6,000. This amount can be used to offset future income. The bank, therefore, allows for the changing financial circumstances many young people may find themselves in when earning income primarily during their vacation. This is yet another measure which addresses the changing situations in young people's work and study lives, and again provides an incentive to work and to study.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Additionally, for young people under 18 years of age who have to live away from home, rent assistance will be extended. Rent assistance will also be available to independent youth allowance recipients who are married or who have a dependent child and those dependent recipients who have an approved employment or study related reason to live away from home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another aspect of the youth allowance will be the abolition of the education legal waiting 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> period so that young people in lower income families&mdash;the ones whom the Labor Party were supposed to be looking after; the ones whom we are now looking after because the Labor Party has failed those people&mdash;will not now have to wait that three&hyphen;month period after they finish school for their income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Austudy minimum payment of $1,000 per annum will also be abolished. This will mean that a lot more young people are likely to qualify for payment than did in the previous situation. There were many cases where students who qualified for an annual payment of less than $1,000 received absolutely nothing. A typical example of this, of course, is that if you were just under the bracket at $999 you were not able to receive anything. Again, we are making sure that this does not recur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My colleague the member for Robertson (Mr Lloyd), when speaking on this bill earlier, mentioned the 13&hyphen;week waiting period for a student changing between Austudy and newstart. This has been a farcical situation for young people, potentially creating very difficult financial situations for them. Under our proposal, this scenario will no longer exist because there will only be the one payment mode of the allowance. Due to the fact that the youth allowance will consist of only one payment, the complexity and duplication found in the current system of income support payments for young people will be reduced. What we presently have is chaotic. There are five main payments and 13 different rates of payments for young people to work through. It is no wonder that Centrelink's office and my office have been inundated by calls when people do not understand what exactly they should be applying for or how they should be working through that system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The effect of this current system is that, even when the most minor changes occur in a young person's lifestyle situation, they are faced with battling the unnecessary complexities that currently surround this particular payment. Often they will find that they need to deal with a completely new government department and new payment rates, adding undue complication and stress. When these young people leave school, they try very hard to find employment. The very last thing they 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10906"> need is to have another hurdle put in front of them which could create additional stress. That is certainly something that I would suggest has encouraged many young people to just give up, to not apply for the different processes and to not worry about trying to find work. It is sad that we have allowed that situation to develop.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new youth allowance addresses these unnecessarily complex situations by providing for a single payment and enabling a far more flexible income support system. In having only the one payment, the unclear divisions which have long occurred between the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs and the Department of Social Security are now being addressed. Such simplification of previous income support systems are already having an effect, as the new Centrelink initiative is showing. There is strong community support for increasing the flexibility and simplicity of government systems. Not only is the increased efficiency of simplified administrative procedures beneficial to the taxpayer; in this instance, it enables those receiving a youth allowance to be more flexible in their approach to work, to study and to training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The youth allowance is a strong social policy of this government. We want to tackle unemployment. We want to ensure that our young people have a future. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> recently referred to Australia as becoming a `welfare dependent society'. But you do not have to read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> to learn about this. In my electorate of Canning, I hear only too often how desperately people try to rid themselves of the circumstances which trap them in the welfare dependency syndrome. I know of young people who want jobs, who want training, but they find this hard to engage in because their parents and friends have equally struggled to achieve this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A life of social security benefits&mdash;the welfare from cradle to grave&mdash;is not what I want for Australian people. Indeed, it was the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) who referred to that yesterday during question time&mdash;not precisely in the context of this bill&mdash;when she talked about the `cradle to grave' mentality. If that is what the Labor 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Party wants, fine, but it is not what we on this side of the House want.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> With families of third generation unemployed existing in Australia today, this government makes absolutely no apologies for addressing the issue of unemployment by using a wide range of strategies. These are aimed not only at improving employment but also at removing the mind&hyphen;set of some people who, from a young age, make the assumption that unemployment payments are a viable alternative to work or to accumulating skills and training for employment. I make this point because it reflects a view that I have held for a long time: that there have not been sufficient incentives to go on to further study or training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Being unemployed from a young age makes it difficult for anyone to find work, and I feel extremely sorry for those people who battle with this concept and who put every effort into finding work and still find at the end of the day that they have not been successful. The stigma of being unemployed and the feelings of no confidence and hopelessness can last for a long time and have a very traumatic effect on our young people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But this government believes in the potential of young people. We also know that people are far more likely to become employed if they are educated and skilled. The youth allowance sends a strong message to young people that training and education is the key to their future. Young people who leave school at the age of 15, 16 or 17 with little formal training or education will find it hard to get work. There is absolutely no doubt about that. The youth allowance seeks to maximise incentives for young people to study and receive further training on leaving school so that they will not fall into this very possible category of the long-term unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also see that parents have a responsibility to ensure that their children have a positive future. To this end, there will be a youth allowance parental income and assets test and means test which will be more generous than the test currently applying to Austudy. This will measure the capacity of parents to support their dependent children 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10907"> financially. We need to ensure that parents, as well as their children, are responsible for maximising the wellbeing of the younger generation. Indeed, it is the parents' responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of the 560,000 currently receiving some form of income support, 378,000 will receive the same amount they are currently receiving while 137,000 will receive more than they are currently receiving. The government is spending $25 million in the first year of introducing this scheme and is making this a very worthwhile and very positive investment for our future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me close by saying that I understand the Labor Party has been saying that this is a cost measure. This is not a cost measure to the government. The government is spending that additional $25 million that I just mentioned in introducing the youth allowance, and that is good for the future of our young people. This is a fine policy. It is a fine bill. It is a policy which is taking a proactive stance in encouraging the youth of Australia to view their future positively by providing incentives for them to develop the necessary skills and training to be far better prepared for our changing labour market and the changing world. I commend this bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

It is a second reading amendment that highlights the way in which this bill does not address a number of the items that are really needed by Australian youth&mdash;the fact that this bill withdraws support from 18&hyphen; to 20&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds in families with incomes as low as $23,400 and the fact that it abolishes benefits to 16&hyphen; and 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;old unemployed people at the same time that the government has not introduced education and training opportunities that would fulfil the needs of those people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government would have everyone believe that the only reason for this bill is that it is attempting to simplify the existing system of payments available to those under 25 years 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of age. It claims that there is no ulterior motive or hidden agenda. It claims that this is not a savings measure. Indeed, the honourable member for Canning (Mrs Johnston) has just repeated that claim. But, if one looks at the explanatory memorandum, one sees that it indicates that distinctly for this bill there are savings. It tries to argue off that this bill is part of a whole package and that in some way overall there is a greater impact and perhaps additional funding, but it does not give precise details about where that comes from.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government claims that the existing raft of payments available to young people are just too confusing for young people and that this is the prime motivation for change. But, as with a lot of the legislation brought before this place, the government has failed to tell the Australian public the full story. With this legislation the government is abandoning a considerable number of young people. It has decided, for instance, that 16&hyphen; and 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds do not deserve to be supported financially if they are unemployed. This would mean forcing some 27,000 young Australians back to school if they wanted to receive support. I emphasise the word `forcing'&mdash;the compulsion. The government has decided this without any regard to the individual personal circumstances or any consideration of appropriate measures to keep these young people at school.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has decided this without considering the impact of an additional 27,000 enrolments on the state school system. We should not delude ourselves that it would be predominantly into the state school system that we would find these people going. It has been said about the impact of these 27,000 enrolments that an additional $140 million in funding to the states and territories would be required, funding which the government will not provide. It has reached this decision without examining the effects that its own savage budgets have had on school education. For all the rhetoric from this government about its priorities, education and training have borne the major brunt of the government's cuts. Obviously this has not been without its toll on young Australians.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10908">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course the opposition wants to see young Australians in education and employment. That is a point that needs to be emphasised because, regrettably, in this debate those opposite in supporting this measure have tried to portray the opposition as not seeing that as an aim, that we should see as many of our young Australians in education and employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, to just cut 16&hyphen; and 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds off benefits and slash the funding that provides them with education and employment opportunity is not the way to achieve that goal. The consequences of removing benefits from 16&hyphen; and 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds must be examined. Many leave school in the first place because of family problems, financial problems or social disadvantage, or because they are not suited to school. Throwing them off benefits does nothing to alleviate any of the issues that I have mentioned. It means that they will be forced to deal with these problems without the income support that they previously enjoyed. If the government is really serious about helping 16&hyphen; and 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds to remain at school, it should encourage them by providing a supportive environment which addresses the difficulties they have in remaining at school.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, the government could reinstate the students at risk program. This initiative of the previous Labor government was specifically designed to identify and assist young people at risk of leaving school early. The government axed this program, yet the program did and would have continued to do more to keep 16- and 17-year-olds at school than throwing them off benefits. Students require work oriented career education, work experience programs and expanded school&hyphen;to&hyphen;work transition programs. That is without question. In that context the government must take up the pattern of growth funding for TAFE that had been established under previous governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government states that its jobs pathway program is one of the solutions. The opposition has no qualms about the job pathways program as a program. In fact, it is an extension and a rebadging of the jobs pathways guarantee program introduced by Labor in 1995. But, if a program like the jobs pathway 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> program is to succeed, it must operate in areas where there is high unemployment. I have said before in this place that schools in my electorate, which has suburbs with some of the highest unemployment rates in Melbourne, do not even have access to the jobs pathway program&mdash;not one. The funding, I contend, has gone to the soft options, to schools in areas with strong labour market programs. I believe that for this program to be successful it must be targeted to areas of greatest need so that the government can show that it is serious about addressing these problems in the areas of greatest disadvantage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another proposal that has been highlighted by some government members in the context of this debate has been the work for the dole program. The work for the dole program has some serious deficiencies. It is seriously deficient in that it does not offer a training element. On that ground I have some reservations about the program. I was interested to analyse where the first rounds of funding for work for the dole programs had gone. The electorate of Scullin is part of the north eastern suburbs of Melbourne: the four municipalities of Darebin, Banyule, Nillumbik and Whittlesea. It is an area of high unemployment and high youth unemployment. How many work for the dole projects will be operating in the north&hyphen;eastern suburbs of Melbourne under the first round of funding of this much heralded program by the government? The answer is nil.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was interested to look at an analysis that appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of 10 November, where against different electorates of this place and their youth unemployment rates were shown the number of work for the dole projects that were allocated to those electorates. I was particularly interested in a table that appeared in that article which indicates that the electorate of Cowper is alleged to have the highest youth unemployment rate, 29.6 per cent, but that in the electorate of Cowper, it is alleged in this article, there is only one work for the dole project. Whilst I understand that it would be contended by the member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) that this is an electorate ably represent 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="10909"> ed by a member of one of the coalition parties, it is an example of the imbalance between the rates of youth unemployment and the allocation of these projects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the Labor held electorate of Newcastle, with a youth unemployment rate of 24.1 per cent, there are no projects allocated. In the Labor held electorate of Throsby, with 21.4 per cent, again there are no projects allocated. So I hope that the government will understand that, even if one is to disagree with the rationale for some of the programs it put in place, if members of the coalition, ministers and backbenchers come in and herald the value of things such as work for the dole, however we might contest that, or herald the advantages of the jobs pathway program, where we might get greater agreement, if it is not established that those programs are meeting the needs of those areas with the greatest disadvantage, how do we then go back to these 16- and 17-year-olds who are being told that if they are unemployed the best course of action for them is to be in school and not give them any assistance to get into employment? Why should they think that this type of legislation should be lauded and heralded?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In schools in my electorate, which try as hard as all high schools would be trying to cater for students of varying abilities to learn and with varying levels of interest in their education, one of the observations that is made about the types of students whom we are talking about here, the types of young people who are going to be forced back into school&mdash;forced back with great reluctance, in many cases&mdash;is that they are attracted to the types of courses that have the highest cost. The modern trend in the way state education is going, especially in the state of Victoria, is that students are expected to pay for the materials, trips and excursions for some of the subjects. We are finding that those students whom we have been able to keep in school&mdash;when perhaps previously their motivation for staying in school would have been low and we have been able to keep that motivation up by attracting them with courses that fulfil their needs and also create some interest for them&mdash;are being disadvantaged because they are doing some of the courses that attract the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> highest costs to them by way of materials and so-called `voluntary' fees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us get back to these 16- and 17-year-old young Australians who are going to be forced off benefits. If the government were really serious about helping these young Australians to get education and employment opportunities, it would not have cut the 117,000 places in labour market programs for young people; it would not have overseen the decline of case management for the young unemployed by the introduction of the new jumbled private employment service market. However, because the government is not really interested in any of these areas, it did all of these things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So why then the youth allowance? The explanatory memorandum gives the game away this time. It states quite clearly:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The youth allowance reinforces the government's philosophy that families should support young people until they have achieved financial independence.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The youth allowance represents part of this government's moral agenda, which has the basic belief that young people should be at home with their parents and should be financially supported by their parents. Whilst this might be the case for the majority of young people and the majority of families, I believe it is a naive and romantic notion that this should be applied in 100 per cent of cases. In some cases, at worst, it is dangerous. The government has completely failed to take the individual circumstances of many thousands of young people into account. It does not understand that there are many young people who, through no fault of their own, cannot live at home or cannot be financially dependent on their families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The conservative side of politics often accuses this side of politics of being interested in too much social engineering. But what could be more socially engineered than forcing some 27,000 16- and 17-year-olds back to school without providing the necessary support mechanisms? This is all done to suit the government's belief that parents should be financially responsible for 16- and 17-year-olds, regardless of the individual's circumstances or the circumstances of the particular family.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10910">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is perverse for the government to try to justify all of this on the basis of mutual obligation. This proposal represents the very antithesis of mutual obligation. It seeks to take away from 16&hyphen; and 17-year-olds without offering anything in return. This stands in contrast with the concept of mutual obligation, as displayed by Labor in government with Working Nation. Mutual obligation is about offering opportunity in exchange for the benefit&mdash;not withdrawing the benefit unilaterally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been claimed that there are some positive aspects to this bill. One of these undoubtedly is the extension of rent assistance to Austudy recipients. Yet, as is always the case with this government, the positive things it implements come at the expense of others; that is, 16- and 17-year-olds on unemployment benefits being sold down the river to pay for rent assistance for Austudy recipients.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government did this in the hope that it could buy the support of organisations like the National Union of Students. Although the National Union of Students for many years has been calling for the extension of rent assistance to Austudy recipients, the NUS did not, to its credit, fall for the ploy. While welcoming the rent assistance expansion, the National Union of Students has stated quite clearly:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The way that this government has configured the youth allowance constitutes a policy of `divide and rule'&mdash;setting some of the most impoverished sections of society up against each other as competitors for crumbs from the remainders of the welfare state.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Many speakers in this debate have concentrated on the impact of the common youth allowance on young people. But we must realise that these proposals impact upon their families also.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The parental income test that is to apply to 18- to 20-year-olds living at home on unemployment benefits is another in the series of harsh and draconian tests that this government has introduced: for instance, the inclusion of the family home in the means test for nursing home care. Now there is the proposal that, if a 19-year-old unemployed person's parents earn more than $23,350 per annum, that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> person's benefit is affected. Furthermore, the benefit cuts out completely when that amount reaches $41,477 per annum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an effect not only on the unemployed person himself or herself but also on the family that will be required to support that person. For instance, a young unemployed 19-year-old whose father earns $27,000 per annum and whose mother earns $15,000 per annum in a part-time job will get nothing. These people are by no means wealthy. These people are pretty much the typical battlers that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) claims to champion. Yet this government now expects them to support totally their 19-year-old child. How can a family with earnings at these modest levels be expected to cope with the needs of a 19-year-old as well as everything else that is required of them? How will these battlers be able to feel relaxed and comfortable about their lives with this added burden?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government were really serious about young people staying at school, it would offer them support to do so and offer them a variety of choices to reach their full potential. That is why part (2) of this second reading amendment is very important. It calls on the government to introduce education and training opportunities so that every young Australian has access to the education and skills needed for full participation in the workplace and in society. It should not try to characterise these young people in the one mode. The government must realise that the needs of young people are diverse and that, therefore, the things it proposes should be diverse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor governments over the last decade have been very keen to see retention rates increase to year 12, and I think that has been very positive. Therefore, it cannot be challenged that the Labor Party does not wish to see as many young Australians as possible staying in education or going straight into employment, but it has to be recognised that those young Australians have varying needs for the types of programs they require. These young Australians simply should not be junked, as they are by this legislation, in the name of the Lyons Forum so&hyphen;called family values. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I stand today to speak in support of the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R346">Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) Bill 1997</XREF> . We are introducing the youth allowance amendments because the current system has failed us as a nation, and in particular our young people, over many years. The previous system facilitated early school leaving and a life on the dole as a viable career option for some young people who were having difficulty at school, who were perhaps not academically inclined, or who lived in areas of high unemployment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is appalling to see the effects of this policy and the culture it created in places like my electorate in regional Australia. There are many cases where we have second generation unemployed people. Some have never experienced the sense of contribution or status that comes with a job. They will spend the best years of their lives, their young adulthood, on the fringes of our society, dependent and often denigrated. These young and now not so young often come to be alienated from society. They have low self&hyphen;esteem and they are trapped in poverty. In many cases the long&hyphen;term unemployment of these too early school leavers leads to self-destructive behaviour, making them even less likely to be accepted by employers looking to take on new labour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No 16-year&hyphen;old should be allowed to be diverted from education and training in return for the dole, no matter how much of a hard time they give their teachers in schools. But that was the unintended consequence for too many under the old system. These amendments, coupled with our new training and apprenticeship policies, and our policies that are revitalising the Australian economy will change all of that. We have put many millions of dollars into making sure that Australia will be a skilled nation in the future; a nation that will take its place amongst the skilled nations in the trading circles we now have to compete in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In an area such as Murray we cannot afford to have a single able&hyphen;bodied person sidelined into the ranks of the unemployed. Our local employers in the agriculture, food processing, metal fabrication, hospitality and tourism and human services sectors are crying out for 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> workers from entry level to skilled trades people, from technicians to people at the most senior management level. Our shortages of all categories of health workers is well known. This government has targeted Murray with initiatives to try to overcome these shortages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Too many of our young people who left school at 16 do not have even the basic literacy and numeracy skills they need to start a job. Our government has identified illiteracy as a major problem for this nation, and in our education policies literacy is the No. 1 priority to overcome. The illiterate and innumerate have always been handicapped in job placement and advancement, and today in this information driven society this is especially the case. Employers want young people who are work ready, motivated, have some essential basic skills and are keen to learn and undertake further training both on and off the job. They want mobile workers who can be lured inland away from the seaboards where 80 per cent of our population lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How will our amendments help? Under the youth allowance young Australians will for the first time have access to a simple system of income support payments that will act as an incentive for them to complete year 12 or get the training they need to maximise their job prospects. The youth allowance will also provide the flexibility young people need as they move from school to work. The youth allowance integrates the five current income support payments available to young people into a single income support payment regardless of whether that person is in education, training, unemployed or sick. The youth allowance will be available to full&hyphen;time students under 25 and those over 25 who are still doing the course that they started before they reached that age. It is also available to people under 21 who are looking for work, combining part&hyphen;time study with jobsearch or undertaking any other approved activity, such as approved volunteer work. We recognise the significance of that volunteer work. We know that it often leads to employment in the long term and contributes a valuable service to Australian communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People under 18 need to be in full&hyphen;time education or training to receive the youth 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10912"> allowance unless they have an exemption. The exemptions take on board the fact that a lot of our young people are in family circumstances where they are disadvantaged. Young people who are not classed as independent will be subject to an actual means test on their family's means. There were some bedding&hyphen;in problems in 1997 with the implementation of the actual means test, particularly for rural students. These have been resolved. Our actual means test will ensure that we have a fair system for assessing people's eligibility for payment based on their parents' income, assets and means.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the years we have seen a system develop in Australia where parents have, to the extent of their means, supported their children to undertake further study, yet young people over 18 could leave school and collect unemployment benefits regardless of their parents' income, assets or means to support them. This was not a rational or equitable system, or one that helped the nation focus the funding available on the areas and individuals most in need. It created an incentive for young people having a hard time at school to leave school even though they knew that their job prospects were minimal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To say that the additional 27,000 students who might now  be retained in the school system are going to be a problem is a rather incredible statement that we have heard too often from the opposition in this debate. How can an extra 27,000 students completing year 12 be a problem for a nation that has to become more skilled to compete? If the schools are not currently serving them well, then those schools must address those problems. We as a nation understand that schools need all the support we can give. The literacy programs, apprenticeships and training schemes that we have introduced are there to work with the traditional education system to make sure that for every student there is an education and training option that suits their intellectual, academic and life interest needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The youth allowance reinforces parental responsibility to support children to the extent that they are able for a reasonable time. Of course it would be magnificent if every parent could be assured of the government bearing 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the cost of their children's education and support indefinitely. Unfortunately, no nation has those sorts of surplus funds. We have to make sure that the funds that are there are targeted to those who do need them. If people are unemployed until 21 or students until 25, we are expecting that parental responsibility to support those children will continue, if they have the means.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The youth allowance also has a relaxed independence criterion for students. Under the current Austudy regulations, to be classed as independent before 25 students have to have worked full&hyphen;time for three of the past four years, full&hyphen;time being 38 hours a week. Under our new amendments, full&hyphen;time will be classed as 20 hours a week. In certain situations, students can be classed as full&hyphen;time if they have worked for as little as 12 months, provided they meet the specially disadvantaged criteria. This is a caring new policy. The bill provides for special safety net provisions in the case of homeless young people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also abolishes the education leaver waiting period, which means that students who left study and were unemployed had to wait up to 13 weeks before becoming eligible for an unemployment payment. This was a very long time for a young person without any other means of support. This change will make it easier for students to move from study to job seeking. It will also help young people who have to leave or defer studies due to ill health. Almost 20,000 former  students will benefit from the abolition of the education leaver waiting period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The youth allowance is a positive response to the educational disadvantage confronting many rural and regional young people. The amendments mean that for the first time ever rent assistance will be available to full&hyphen;time students, bringing their benefits in line with the payments for young unemployed people. This move will make rent assistance available to approximately 70,000 students for the first time, including some 6,000 young people living in country Victoria. The estimated average gain for these students will be $31.30 per fortnight, with a maximum increase of $98.80 per fortnight, depending on the age of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10913"> the student and the amount of rent that they pay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This change recognises the substantial additional costs faced by rural and regional students who have to live away from home to gain access to higher education. For students in my electorate of Murray, only two to four driving hours away from Melbourne, the cost of living away from home is a major factor inhibiting their chance to have a higher education. Unfortunately, local access to higher education, particularly at university level, is often not available close to the homes of our regional students. Figures compiled by the Bendigo Regional Development Board show that there was one local higher education place for every 140 northern Victorians compared to one place for every 40 metropolitan Melbourne students. Even in the one area that country students are overrepresented in&mdash;that is, agriculture studies&mdash;84 per cent of university places in Victoria are in metropolitan Melbourne.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As well as being forced to live away from home, regional students often also have to pay high rent for their accommodation because of the strong rental markets around the universities. Melbourne University, for instance, is located in the inner city suburb of Parkville, where students compete for rental property with professional people working in the city. This competition obviously pushes up rental prices and makes it even more difficult for students to survive. Rural students are already underrepresented in tertiary education. I find it appalling when I look at the figures&mdash;they serve as a constant reminder&mdash;that the one sector in Australia that continues to have declining access to and participation in higher education is young rural Australians. They do not need further financial disincentives acting as a barrier to their accessing higher education. Obviously parents and students in rural areas of Australia are grateful for the extension of rent assistance coming through these amendments, seeing it as relieving a substantial cost burden on them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These changes are long overdue. The system will now be simpler and more flexible for all of our young people as students, as trainees, as job seekers or as a combination of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> these. For too long we have had a system that inadvertently discouraged young people from continuing at school or in training. We do not do our young people any favours by paying them more to be unemployed than to be undertaking some kind of education program. We all know of young students in universities who have deliberately gone part time and claimed they were unemployed so that they could have more dollars to live on. Nor are we helping young people by allowing them to leave school and receive unemployment benefits rather than assisting them to complete their secondary education or to seek out the many thousands of new apprenticeships or traineeships that this government has helped to create. We must, as I have said before, help young people to develop the skills and the training that are going to give them a place in the modern Australian society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a difficult labour market for unskilled young people; it has been for decades in this country. However, in my electorate of Murray, which encompasses the Goulburn&hyphen;Murray&hyphen;Loddon region, we have an unemployment rate on the eastern side of the electorate, in particular, of only 6.6 per cent. But the jobs that used to be around in local government, in the public sector, jobs where you could leave school at 16 and expect to spend your life with no further education and training, have basically dried up. We need our people in Murray to have continued to a point in their education where they are highly literate and numerate, skilled, trained and work ready. Policies of the previous government left a number of our students in the opposite situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In our area we have had some $400 million in investment in our agribusiness food industry over the last two years. We are major exporters. Having an unskilled labour force not only limits life opportunities for the unskilled people, who cannot get a job, but also cripples businesses that are held back because they cannot find the skilled work force to meet their move away from commodity production to high value added exports. At the moment, the harvesting of our fruit is reliant on approximately 4,000 international backpackers who arrive in the area each 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10914"> year&mdash;we hope&mdash;because they know they can earn very good money for work that they can learn to do very quickly. We cannot get the six per cent able&hyphen;bodied unemployed in the area to do that work. But don't for a minute think that work that our pickers do is unskilled work. Increasingly, the way you pick affects the value of your piece of fruit when it goes to the high value added fresh markets in Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fruit picking is not just a short-term working option; it leads to skilled pruning, to skilled irrigation practices, to pest control on orchards and to orchard management itself. We cannot get our young people to consider careers in orchard management or in dairy management because too many of them have said, `I can leave school and go on the dole.' We are currently dependent, for example, on Albanians undertaking occupational traineeships on three-year visas in the Goulburn Valley to do the skilled pruning in the orchards. These people are only temporary entrants to Australia, and when they leave at the end of their traineeships they will take their skills back to Albania to develop Albania as a nation with world-class orchards. When they leave we could again be left with labour shortages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems incredible that, while our TAFEs are helping Albanians to become skilled, our own students in high schools and colleges have turned away from that work. We believe the changes in our policies will make students look hard at regional work opportunities. They will look at the traineeships and apprenticeships that are now offered by the Goulburn Ovens TAFE Trainee and Apprenticeship Services: the one-stop shop in Shepparton. Those who have had a hard time at school will no longer think, `My 16th birthday is drawing near; it is time for me to start thinking about joining the unemployment queues, sitting on park benches down by the river and collecting the dole every fortnight.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The youth allowance will encourage people to complete or further their education by removing the undesirable incentives to leave education or training. The new allowance creates a genuine incentive for students to complete year 12 or its equivalent before 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> leaving school. The investment in our fruit, dairy and wine industries is dependent on a skilled work force. This nation is seeing that need and is responding to that need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the local level in my electorate of Murray, there are numerous examples of the commitment of industry and employees to work hand in glove with this government under the new vocational education traineeships. We now have in five of our colleges students who are undertaking metal fabrication courses, hospitality and tourism courses, and food technology courses. Those students are no longer teased by their colleagues who have left school a year ago as to why they are bothering. They know that there is a future for them. In the years that follow this amendment becoming law, we can expect that no student at 16 will look on from the sidelines of life. We will have all of our students participating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To establish the food sector, among other industries, as a major exporter in our region, we will have to put all of our efforts into having a trained and motivated work force. We are in the process of establishing the Murray region food export forum, as part of the Federal Supermarket to Asia Council. The first item on the regional agenda is a comprehensive investigation and analysis of ways to overcome the labour shortages across many industries. That export food forum is already welcoming the amendments that we are debating in the House today. The forum understands that they will make a major difference in how our young people consider their futures in regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, we are looking to establish a Skills Centre as part of another new initiative in the region called The Food Experience. This will assist employers in the training of staff to industry standards and in line with the individuals needs and requirements of local industry. That was not happening two years ago; it is happening now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The official opening of the new Goulburn Ovens Trainee and Apprenticeship Services&mdash;the one-stop shop&mdash;in Shepparton several months ago has brought a new lease of life to young people who now do not see work for the dole as a career option but as work for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10915"> themselves, for their families and for the communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister's recent announcement that the federal government will provide funding for 100,000 new apprenticeships and traineeships in 1997-98 in high growth industries such as technology, hospitality and tourism, sport and recreation, finance, and in traditional trades is significant. While the opposition talks about 27,000 more students being made to stay in school and how that it is a tragedy, we say that there will be 100,000 new apprenticeships and traineeships for young people who can look beyond the traditional VCE&mdash;or year 11 and 12&mdash;to careers that will leave them as skilled technocrats.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a government which understands the realities and the needs of this economy, and the alienation that goes with long-term unemployment. We are a government that cares.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I concur with my colleague the member for Murray (Mrs Stone) and endorse her remarks. Despite the predictable rhetoric from the other side, the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R346">Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) Bill 1997</XREF>  is not a measure introduced by this government to chuck kids off the dole. In fact, of the 560,000 young people currently collecting benefits, more than one-quarter will be better off and more than half will not be affected by these measures at all. Yet again, Labor have been left stranded on social policy, and their only response is to wage a scare campaign. We are seeing it with aged care, we saw it with industrial relations, and no doubt we will see more of it with this issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this government wants to concentrate on is the positive aspects of this initiative. We will not be a victim of the gloom and doom merchants on the other side. This is a positive solution to a growing social problem. What this bill is really about is ensuring that our young people have every opportunity to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> succeed once they leave school. It is about encouraging parents to live up to their parental responsibilities. It is about reforming the overburdened and complex welfare system and the already overtaxed Australian worker.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first issue I will raise is that of education. As a teacher, I have a great appreciation of the need for all students to get the best education available to them. For the majority of students this will mean completing year 12 and possibly going on to further education. This bill encourages students to do just that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the reasons this country has such a high level of youth unemployment is that it has been far easier to drop out and collect the dole than to continue studying. The real tragedy of this is that the former administration actually encouraged students to do this. By providing unprecedented levels of welfare to our youth, the former administration developed a welfare culture in this country that it is going to take some time to correct. For those who leave school early and try to find work, their chances in a highly competitive labour market are diminishing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A student who finishes senior is far more likely to land a job over someone who left school after year 10. Of course there will be the safety net designed to catch those genuine cases where further education is simply not an option for various reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The idea of the apprenticeship system is also to be commended as an initiative to encourage those children who do not wish to continue to year 12 to get paid while they train. A four-year apprenticeship gives them a skill, a ticket for life. This is what welfare should provide: assistance for those who are unable to help themselves, not for those looking for an easier way out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An education is an investment in your future. Granted this does not have to mean a formal university degree. Education comes in many forms&mdash;traineeships, apprenticeships. Whatever form it takes, it all leads to greater opportunities in future life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also encourages parents to accept responsibility for their children until they achieve independence. It is not unreasonable to expect parents to accept this responsibility. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10916"> The youth allowance will be means tested so that those families with limited means will still be assisted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Most parents relish having their children at home, and it is quite often very difficult and emotional to let them go. Obviously this will occur at some point, but later rather than sooner under this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Again, there will be the exceptions&mdash;for example, when a young person is required to live away from home to study or obtain work. This group will actually receive a higher rate of payment to assist with the added expense of pursuing their education or employment options. In fact, rent assistance will be available to students for the first time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another benefit of this bill is that it will simplify the system of payments. The current welfare system is cumbersome and confusing for the thousands who have to deal with it. The introduction of the youth allowance will rationalise five different types of payments into a single payment. It will also significantly reduce the number of different rates of payment. So you can see that this bill has clear advantages for the majority of our young people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is another step forward towards reforming the welfare system in this country. This is necessary for a number of reasons. The most pressing of these is the fact that the gap between those paying taxes and those collecting welfare is narrowing at an alarming rate. What happens to society when the two come together?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My children already face the prospect of there being no age pension when they retire. Obviously this is not what I would be wishing for them, but it has always been there as a safety net. I will do all I can to ensure my children provide for their own retirement, as I and my husband are doing and as my parents have done before me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is equally important to reform a system which outwardly encouraged young Australians to leave home, drop out of school and virtually drop out of society but remain on very healthy benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While campaigning for the seat of Bowman last year, I was approached by several dis 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> traught parents whose children had left home and who could not get any information about where they were or indeed how they were. These children had fled the family home despite the fact that there was no evidence of abuse or even stricter than usual parental guidance. However, it was being planted in the minds of these youngsters that they could make unsubstantiated claims about their parents and the government would pay them to run away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is worse is that the department was actually out and about selling this fact to the kids in schools. Departmental officers were visiting high schools to tell the students what their rights were and what the government could do for them. If that is not irresponsible policy, I do not know what is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To make matters worse, the parents were given absolutely no information about their children. One parent simply wanted to know if her child was still at school and eating properly and had not ended up in a gutter somewhere. This information was denied that parent. As far as I am concerned, this is unconscionable behaviour&mdash;even for a Labor government. The youth allowance will reduce the chance of this occurring in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those who choose to leave home prior to reaching independence will have to satisfy a special safety net criteria aimed at a person who is especially disadvantaged in terms of education or employment. For those who consider this to be harsh, take a look at what the current system has created. We have a confusing, complex and unfair system which rewards people for dropping out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This takes me back to the main point of this bill: to ensure that every young Australian is encouraged to further their education or employment opportunities rather than opt out for unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much has been said in recent times about the appalling rate of illiteracy amongst our young. There really can be no good reason for this. Teachers are doing their best to provide the best education for their students, but they are virtually bashing their heads against a brick wall in many cases. Studies have shown that 30 per cent of 14-year-olds have below average literacy standards.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10917">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government, and in particular the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Dr Kemp), has set in place a strategy to correct this problem and has enlisted the help of various state governments. However, all these efforts will be for nothing if students are encouraged to drop out of school and take the easy road.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dropping out and living on the dole may seem like an attractive option now, but when the welfare dries up, as it inevitably will, where will these people be? I strongly commend this bill to the House. I can refer to examples in my own electorate, where initiatives which encourage youth to stay at school, to be employed and to be trained and which encourage the school to work programs are growing at a rapid rate of knots.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend all the government services and providers for their efforts in ensuring that our youth have a transition education from school to work that really meets the criterion of a change for the better for their employment outcomes. I look forward to working with the educational institutions, the students and the youth in my area to promote these practices and to encourage training facilities at a local level so they can stay in the area to be trained to a level that meets the needs of a growing small business community. We have a vibrant small business community that has the capability of assisting our youth&mdash;those who do not want to go on to higher and tertiary education&mdash;and to see that the needs of the group that wish to go into traineeships and vocational education are met. I commend this bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R346">Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) Bill 1997</XREF>  and on the amendment that has been moved by the opposition. In common with most members of the House of Representatives, I am a parent, and I am old enough to be a parent of young people whose ages range from 25 to 15. I know something about this bill, I know something about the pressure that young people are under in today's society and I know something&mdash;contrary to the popular 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> view opposite&mdash;about what is happening in the youth labour market.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much of what we have heard from those opposite has been nonsense, much of it predicated on the superficial view that the government is seeking in some way to make it more difficult for young people to be participators in today's society. That, as every government member knows, is absolute nonsense. With these changes the government seeks to give young people a sense of self&hyphen;worth and real encouragement to further their education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said in my opening remarks, I am a parent. I am a parent concerned about young people and their job opportunities. But I know that the most positive contribution that my wife and I have been able to make in the parenting stakes towards the future of our young people has been to give them a sense of self&hyphen;worth. I would not claim any particular credit for that. Credit for whatever sense of self&hyphen;worth our children have ought to rest entirely with my wife, who always understood what it was to offer positive reinforcement. Self-worth comes out of feeling that you are needed in the community, that your contribution is recognised in the community and that the community is better because you are a part of it. That comes principally out of either a secure family environment or out of being employed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All the government seeks to do with this bill is to encourage young people to be employed, and it is almost beyond belief that we should be here encouraging young people to be employed and having that encouragement frustrated by those opposite. What does this bill actually do? It says, `We will make it more attractive for you to either be in employment or be in education.' And we are expected to apologise for actually encouraging young people to further their education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said in my opening remarks, what builds someone's sense of self&hyphen;worth? It is knowing that they have an opportunity to contribute, and that opportunity to contribute is dramatically enhanced if they have an education. Of all of the parties represented in this parliament, we are the ones least likely to run some sort of academic line or to suggest 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10918"> that only the doctors and lawyers of Australia have a contribution to make, for we represent those who have been self&hyphen;employed as farmers, plumbers and retailers, who know what it is like to be struggling for economic survival, who know what it is like to be dependent on their own wits and resources and who know that education comes largely out of experience.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose of this bill is not to encourage young people to take up necessarily a tertiary education. Most young people with a capacity to be educated at a tertiary level will already pursue that option and recognise that they are doing so and making a contribution through HECS. Far from focusing on tertiary education at the degree level, this bill encourages young people who find school difficult not to opt out because unemployment has been so attractive but to opt in by picking up a TAFE course or an apprenticeship that takes some form of formal education with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill sets out to ensure that young people stay in education. The simply reality and the statistical evidence is dramatic. The simple reality is that, if you are in education and stay in the education stream, you will have an opportunity to be employed but that you will lose if in fact you choose to leave school at 15 or 16. The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock), in introducing the bill, made that clearly evident. All of the information that he advanced in support of this bill indicated that those who leave school early walk into a much higher possibility of unemployment than those who stay to gain additional tertiary education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What have we in the government sought to do? We have said we will introduce an allowance which, frankly, will not be available unless you choose a lifestyle that will lead to employment. We are supposed to apologise for that and amend the bill and make changes to suit the purely political purposes of those opposite, ignoring what has been the dramatic problem of Australian society. We are attempting to address the fundamental problem of youth unemployment by encouraging young people to get an education, and the opposition expect us to be 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> apologetic. Here we have the opposition running their usual scare campaign by suggesting to the mums and dads of Australia that the passage of this bill will mean that they have to support their children for a longer period of time and that their children will lose employment opportunities. In reality this bill says, statistically and evidentially, that they will gain employment opportunities as a result of the passage of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill specifically encourages young people to be better qualified. In common with most on the government benches&mdash;including the member for Leichhardt (Mr Entsch) and you, Mr Deputy Speaker Reid, with great respect&mdash;I have been and remain an employer. I know which people I want to employ, and my willingness to employ them has a great deal to do not with the number of tertiary degrees they have but with their willingness to work and learn. This bill says we will select those who are willing to either learn or work and we will set up the support systems of Australia in such a way that they will be encouraged to either learn or be employed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As an employer, I welcome that strategy. That is the strategy that ensures that the people who are in the work force are there because they will be productive Australians. All sorts of drivel comes from the opposition benches, from those who have never employed anybody, about what it is that motivates employers. Fundamentally, Mr Deputy Speaker, as I believe you know and as the member for Leichhardt is aware, as an employer I am happy so long as my employee is generating for me just a little more than he or she is costing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is hardly selfish or greedy. There are employers around Australia seeking to employ people who will generate just a little more than it costs to employ them. This bill means that they will come into the work force better educated. As I said, they will not necessarily have degrees or formal qualifications from any of the major faculties of the universities around Australia. But, having said, `Yes', we will pick up all those alternatives to school that involve greater depth of education, whether those be TAFE or some other support mechanism. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10919">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are expected to vote against this. We are expected to discourage this incentive to get young people into the work force better informed. On what grounds are we expected to do this, when even the statistical evidence proves that if they stay in the system, as this bill encourages them to do, they will be that much more employable?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said in my opening remarks, I am a parent. I know what I want for my children. I want them to feel fulfilled in life and to feel they can make a contribution and have, as a result, a greater sense of their own worth. That is the healthiest atmosphere they can be in. I am not much fussed about how much they earn, because I happen to have observed an odd eccentricity in life which is that even those in holy orders who earn nothing can still be cheerful and see themselves as making a major contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue is not where young people are in status terms. The issue is not whether they will be employed as doctors, lawyers or, if working for me, fruit pickers. The issue is whether they will be more employable. That is the one thing this bill does. It encourages young people to be more employable or to be full&hyphen;time students until they turn 25.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Are we supposed to discourage that level of education, when most of us as members of parliament on both sides of this chamber have spent our time being inundated by parents who have said to us, `It is a matter of real frustration that my little Johnny or my Jill', for example, `earn less on Austudy than they would if they were unemployed and so they ask why they should be in some form of tertiary education.' They have been in my office saying it, and I have no doubt they have been in the offices of all the other members in this chamber saying the same thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why would we encourage a system that pays people more to be unemployed? That is, of itself, an absurdity. We as the government have done what I would have thought the mums and dads around Australia wanted done. We have set up a system that encourages people to be employed or, if they are not employed, to stay at school so that they will get employment.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have heard the criticisms from those opposite, suggesting that in some way this is an enormous penalty for the mums and dads of Australia and that they may have to support their children. If the mums and dads of Australia find themselves in a situation of financial stringency, they do not have to go on supporting their children under this bill. If you are a very low income earner, there is an opportunity for your children to be recognised as the children of very low income earners. But the youth allowance, structured as we propose, will be available, in one form or another and in one proportion or another, to all those who are part of families in Australia whose income falls somewhere under $40,000. That is hardly an unreasonable gesture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me hasten to add that I am very glad that I am not an Australian parent raising a family on $23,000 per year. That would be exceedingly difficult. The government recognises that. I am pleased and grateful that that is not a choice I have to make. It is also not a choice I am thrusting onto Australian families, because, between that figure and approximately $40,000, there are gradual rates of the allowance made available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recognise that it would not be easy to be raising a family on that low income. So does the parliament and so does the government. The government has taken some steps&mdash;not as many as we would like&mdash;to alleviate the difficulty those families face.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point of the whole debate is this: if you are a parent of a child in Australia, you have some fundamental, inescapable responsibilities. I do not say that with any self-righteous air. If my children have not been a burden to the Australian community, it is only thanks to their mother and not their father. But parents have some fundamental, inescapable responsibilities to ensure that their children have a secure home and family life, have the opportunity for an education and are encouraged to seek work.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HE4">Mr ANDREW</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Petrie for her interjection. The reason this bill is in place is simply to ensure that Australian families recognise their responsibility to their 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10920"> children and if they are unable to meet that responsibility get government support and, so far as possible, deliberately encourage their children to further their education.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Were the shadow minister at the table, the member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson), to interject that in some way the support had been inadequate, I would frankly be the first to agree. I wish it were much more generous. I wish the cut-off levels were set at a different spot, just as I wish the support we offer through Austudy was more generous as well. But that is not a choice that I have. It is not a choice that I have because, as a member of the government, I cannot escape the fundamental critical point that this government has faced for the last 18 months&mdash;that is, that the most important thing we must first do for Australian families, for Australian young people and for the Australian unemployed is to address the problem of an inherited deficit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We wish there were more resources to go around. We wish we had more money to make available to Australian families. But we are doing what we must do first&mdash;that is, putting the deficit before setting our family support mechanism at those attractive but unsustainable levels that would only increase our debt and increase our obligations to interest repayments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think there has been far too much criticism of the government as an economically rationalist body and too many suggestions that in some strange way we have ignored our responsibilities to Australians in need. This bill shows that we actually want to meet those responsibilities, that we want to encourage young people who are from needy families to get education and that we want, first and foremost, to balance the books.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am a little tired of those opposite who come in here on a daily basis and suggest that they have some sort of monopoly on all that is decent in society and paint us as lean and mean in our approach to support mechanisms. What we are endeavouring to do through this legislation, and what we are endeavouring to do as a government, is first balance the books so that we have the sort of Australian economy that will generate jobs.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If anyone wants evidence of the fact that the government is largely on the right track they need only look at the events of the last month and the currency crisis in Asia&mdash;the currency crisis that we are told may yet engulf some of our other neighbours in Asia&mdash;and how we have withstood that crisis, almost without hiccup, to get evidence of the fact that the government's economic management has been right on target. That economic management of itself has ensured that business in Australia has an opportunity to thrive. Thriving business in Australia is the one thing that will generate jobs for those young people that we seek to take out of unemployment queues and put into full-time employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This particular piece of legislation is designed to encourage young people to remain at school, to remain in some form of education until they are properly qualified and able to be picked up by the work force. But, more than that, this legislation dovetails with the sorts of economic reforms this government has introduced to encourage small business in Australia to ensure that there are job opportunities for young people. Those job opportunities will only come out of a healthy economy, out of an economy where employers believe that the people they put on will be earning for them just a little more than they will be costing and where there are opportunities to sell the goods and services that are being generated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Too few Australians realise just how much the economy has turned around in the last five years. It would, in fact, be unfair of me not to acknowledge the role of the opposition in turning some of that economic base around. I am, as you are aware, critical of the debt that they generated in the process&mdash;a debt that we are now discharging&mdash;but it would be churlish of me not to recognise that much of our export performance has also been built on changes that they introduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Too few Australians recognise that the most dramatic growth in export performance in Australia is in manufactured goods and that in every instance employers in the export market are employing the most young people. Every graph of employment around Australia categorically indicates that there are more job 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10921"> opportunities in companies involved in exports than there are in companies not involved in exports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The whole point of this legislation is that it allows us to encourage young people to be better qualified for those areas of productivity where we have to be at the cutting edge of world performance&mdash;those areas that involve us participating in exports and facing competition from round the globe&mdash;and ensures that we will have a work force properly trained and ready to make a contribution. The whole purpose of this legislation is to ensure that we have a properly trained work force, that employers around Australia know that they can take a punt on the Australian economy, that there will be employment opportunities and that there will be a pool of unemployed young people who are better qualified to be employed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose of this legislation is to ensure that young people are better qualified for employment. How could anyone&mdash;any Australian or Australian parliamentarian&mdash;vote against a piece of legislation that does nothing more than ensure that young people are better qualified to be employed?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is required is sober, sensible but forward&hyphen;looking action to reduce greenhouse gases and this is the approach my government will adopt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although Australia contributes only 1.4 per cent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions we want to play our part in meeting this challenge. But pulling our weight does not mean carrying more than our share of the burden. Only with all countries working together, carrying equitable burdens, can we achieve an effective global outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This will require creativity, persistence and, in some instances, sacrifices&mdash;but the benefits of preserving our environment and quality of life for the sake of our children are too important to forgo.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Playing our Part&mdash;New Domestic Greenhouse Measures</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For many reasons Australia is quite unique.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our economy has evolved on the basis of our abundant supply of natural resources and efficient production and processing of fossil fuels and mineral resources. Fossil fuels currently provide 94 per cent of our energy needs&mdash;far more than that of any other OECD country. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our population is expected to grow by 30 per cent from 1990 to 2020 compared to less than three per cent in Europe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will continue to experience stronger economic and employment growth than most OECD countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our cities are decentralised and widely separated, resulting in high transport use per capita compared to the smaller, closely populated European Union countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our trade profile means that about 20 per cent of our greenhouse gas emissions are embodied in our exports (notably aluminium and agricultural products)&mdash;double the OECD average and the highest in the industrialised world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our emissions profile is also unique among developed countries where the energy sector accounts for about half of our emissions, compared with an average of 80 per cent for OECD countries; and where land use and forestry account for around 20 per cent of Australia's emissions. This reflects the great significance of agriculture to the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, Australia has a responsibility to export the resources necessary to fuel the growth of her regional partners and to provide the food required for their people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For all of these reasons our emissions are projected to grow faster than other countries. Uniform target proposals that do not take these circumstances into account will place an unfair penalty on Australia and Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Reducing emissions growth is therefore particularly challenging and is more costly for us than for most other industrialised societies. But we are still committed to playing our part in cutting emissions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Without further action, Australia's emissions are expected to grow by around 28 per cent from 1990 to 2010. This is based on a comprehensive approach excluding land use change. Emissions from the energy sector alone are expected to grow by around 40 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The package I announce today will achieve a dramatic reduction of a third in our expected net emissions growth from 1990 to 2010.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10923">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These measures will reduce our net emissions growth from 28 to 18 per cent in that period, or some 39 million tonnes of emissions. This is comparable to the emissions from all the electricity used by households right across Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a realistic, even conservative, calculation of the emission benefits. The benefits from plantations and land use changes, for example, could well be greater than we have estimated. With the most effective implementation of the package, the full support of industry and the community, and the best contribution of the states and territories we may well achieve even greater reductions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Taken with greenhouse measures Australia already has in place, the package will mean Australia's effort broadly compares on the same basis to what the United States and the European Union are proposing. Moreover, we are not waiting for others to act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">None of us should underestimate the commitment required to achieve these outcomes. They will require hard work from all of us. The package gives the lie to those who make exaggerated but ultimately empty claims that fine sounding targets can easily be achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The measures have been developed against the background of our national circumstances and our national interest. They also have been developed against achievements by Australia to date such as reform of our electricity and gas markets, halving the amount of waste going into landfill by the year 2000 compared to 1990 levels and the efforts of particular industries such as the aluminium industry which will reduce emissions by more than 20 per cent over the same period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is seeking realistic, cost&hyphen;effective reductions in key sectors where emissions are high or growing strongly while also fairly spreading the burden of action across our economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The package will allow us to improve the performance of our highly competitive energy&hyphen;dependent sectors while also stimulating new sectors such as renewable energy. It will demonstrate we can improve the environment whilst generating new jobs and exports. Far from risking 90,000 potential jobs, as would 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> be the case if we accepted some proposals, the measures I announce have the potential to create both wealth and additional jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They address emissions across many sectors&mdash;residential, industry, transport, energy, agriculture, forestry and government operations&mdash;in an integrated, effective and, above all, fair way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are prepared to ask industry to do more than they may otherwise be prepared to do, that is, to go beyond a `no regrets', minimal cost approach where this is sensible in order to achieve effective and meaningful outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is providing $180 million over five years for these measures. This package far exceeds the efforts by previous governments on addressing the greenhouse gas problem.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of this expenditure will be spent on completely new measures, while some existing programs will be substantially expanded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Importantly, the level of Commonwealth spending does not represent the whole story. These initiatives will stimulate additional actions and investment by the states and territories, industry and, in some cases, consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our measures build on those in the draft national greenhouse strategy. State and territory leaders have indicated their support for our greenhouse response and have agreed to work with us cooperatively in implementing it and in considering further action of their own.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me outline some of the specific measures.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Renewable Energy</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Renewable forms of energy currently contribute about six per cent to Australia's total energy needs, an amount comparable to the OECD average of 6.4 per cent. The government will be committing $65 million to ensure that this level is increased.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By contributing $21 million, we will create a specialist renewable energy innovation investment fund to provide government and private sector venture capital for companies with high growth potential.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10924">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So that we can capitalise on our skills we will provide a $30 million loans and grants program for the development and commercialisation of the renewable energy industry. This will directly support the creation of new businesses, jobs and exports. This funding represents a huge increase on the $4.8 million over four years spent by the previous government on the renewable energy industry program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And we will also provide $10 million for some leading edge renewable energy `showcase' projects in areas such as tidal power, solar thermal power and photovoltaic technologies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will work with the states and territories to set a mandatory target for electricity retailers to source an additional two per cent of their electricity from renewable energy sources by 2010. This will accelerate the uptake of renewable energy in grid based electricity and provide a larger base for the development of commercially competitive renewable energy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This enormous boost to renewable energy development is a huge improvement on programs such as the Energy Research and Development Corporation which had been overtaken by changes in the energy sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our new programs will stimulate innovative technologies and wealth&hyphen;creating businesses and energy suppliers who provide power to communities, employ Australians and export to the world. It is, in every sense of the word, an action oriented approach.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Energy Market Reform</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The possibilities for fuel substitution and innovation will be enhanced as we continue and accelerate the process of energy market reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will work with the states and industry to develop and implement by the year 2000 efficiency standards for fossil fuel electricity generation, including for brown and black coal and gas fired plants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This will ensure the adoption of best practice new technology in each fossil fuel class. Standards will also be phased in to encourage emissions reductions in existing plants. The 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> standards will apply to new electricity generation projects and existing generation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These initiatives mean that Australian energy suppliers will be able to stand tall when it comes to being clean, green and cost competitive.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Automotive Industry</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1995, 10 per cent of Australia's net emissions were generated by cars, four&hyphen;wheel drives and light commercial vehicles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will implement an automotive industry environmental strategy, in consultation with the automotive and oil industries and other stakeholders, to enhance the industry's environmental performance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This strategy will involve several elements including:</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">1.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> mandatory, model specific, fuel efficiency labelling;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">2.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> harmonised noxious emissions standards with international standards by 2006;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">3.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> a 15 per cent fuel efficiency improvement target by 2010 over business as usual through negotiation with automotive companies; and</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">4.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> bringing forward the phase&hyphen;out of leaded petrol, taking equity considerations into account.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will also develop a basic network of compressed natural gas refuelling stations in selected metropolitan areas to encourage light commercial vehicles to switch to this more environmentally friendly fuel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These measures will reduce air pollution and improve the health of our cities as well as reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Codes and Standards</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will also work with the states, territories and industry to develop energy efficiency codes and standards for housing and commercial buildings, appliances and equipment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For industrial and commercial appliances and equipment we will implement an improved labelling program and minimum energy performance standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will expand the nationwide house energy rating scheme by including a mini 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="10925"> mum energy performance requirement for new houses and major extensions and we will work with the states, territories and industry to develop voluntary minimum energy performance standards for new and substantially refurbished commercial buildings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These initiatives will take us to best practice standards in these important areas. If this voluntary approach does not achieve acceptable progress within 12 months, we will work to implement mandatory standards.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Tree Planting and Revegetation</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Plantations and revegetation are important means of soaking up greenhouse emissions&mdash;known as greenhouse sinks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will work to remove impediments to the development of commercial plantations to achieve the plantations 2020 vision of trebling the plantation estate by 2020. We will establish a bush for greenhouse program to encourage corporate funding of revegetation projects to act as sinks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This will build on the $22 million for farm forestry and the massive $328 million revegetation program being undertaken under the bushcare initiative of the Natural Heritage Trust, which represents the largest revegetation effort ever undertaken with almost a tenfold increase on the funding of revegetation programs of the previous government&mdash;which their successors in opposition did everything to prevent coming into force.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Greenhouse Challenge Program</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The greenhouse challenge program is central to the partnership between government and industry to reduce emissions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This program currently has 100 signed agreements with businesses from a wide range of sectors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In total, companies that have signed agreements account for over 45 per cent of Australia's industrial emissions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Participants have committed themselves to reduce their forecast growth in emissions by about 22 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent by the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The announcement today provides extra funding of $27 million to extend the program to smaller companies and to increase the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> number of large and medium company participants to 500 by the year 2000 and to more than 1,000 companies by 2005.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Commonwealth Greenhouse Office</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In order to ensure this package of measures is delivered, a Commonwealth greenhouse office will be established within the department of the environment. This office will have responsibility for the coordination of domestic climate change policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The office will be the lead Commonwealth agency on greenhouse matters. It will provide a mechanism to ensure domestic greenhouse matters receive the priority the issue deserves and the government intends.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Other Measures</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further measures as part of this statement include action to reduce emissions in urban areas, initiatives to work towards best energy practice in targeted industries, funding towards an ethanol pilot plant, the development of a national carbon accounting system, funding to support various national greenhouse strategy related measures, and additional funding to ensure commercial joint implementation projects in developing countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also committed to reducing emissions from the Commonwealth government's own operations, including purchases of more energy efficient equipment and appliances. We will be setting fuel consumption targets for the entire Commonwealth vehicle fleet.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Australia's Approach: Forward Looking and Global</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government believes that, like our national effort, the international response to climate change must be effective in terms of meeting the environmental challenge, equitable in terms of the costs to be borne by individual countries and least damaging as possible to the living standards and employment prospects of our people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For these reasons Australia has proposed that individual targets for industrialised countries be differentiated according to national circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Uniform target proposals based on a 1990 base year would impose a disproportionate, even devastating, burden on Australia. The 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10926"> cost to our economy of meeting a uniform target of the order proposed by the European Union would impose a cost on all Australians that other countries would not accept.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some industries fundamental to the health of our economy would be hardest hit. The non&hyphen;ferrous metals, iron and steel and coal industries would be seriously affected, and future investment and employment growth would be significantly jeopardised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even stabilising our emissions at 1990 levels would put at risk $68 billion of energy intensive projects and the tens of thousands of potential jobs for Australians that go with them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Significant regional dislocation would result in places like the Illawarra and Hunter Valley in New South Wales, the Bowen Basin and Gladstone in Queensland, Geelong and the La Trobe Valley in Victoria, Port Pirie in South Australia and the Kwinana region of Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Moreover, the European Union is not asking its own members to reach a uniform target. Portugal, for example, would be permitted to increase its emissions, under the European Union plan, by almost 40 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We reject this approach of punishing Australian industries to carry a burden that other countries are not prepared to accept. It is far more sensible and responsible to improve the performance of existing industries and build new green industries to provide for both jobs and the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe the way forward is for all countries to play a fair part, with flexibility in the methods used to reach the targets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We strongly support a comprehensive approach to setting targets which covers all greenhouse gases, emission sources, sinks and sectors. The wider the coverage the greater the flexibility to maximise environmental benefit and minimise economic cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia also believes that an international emissions trading regime would help minimise costs of reducing emissions. We would support emissions trading on the basis of a satisfactory initial allocation of emission entitlements and a practical resolution of the administrative difficulties involved.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Joint implementation measures whereby developed countries can work with developing countries on emission reduction projects can achieve worthwhile outcomes. Australia is looking to Kyoto to support joint implementation as a means of engaging developing countries in the global effort.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All along we have argued that climate change is a global problem and all countries should contribute to the solution. Action by developed countries alone will be ineffective. Over time, developing countries must become involved&mdash;as by early next century they will account for over 50 per cent of global emissions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Kyoto outcome should provide for procedures and time frames for negotiating targets by major developing country emitters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia's proposal for negotiated, differentiated targets is the best basis for a fair outcome which has a prospect of actually being put into practice and improving the world's environment. It is also the best basis for encouraging developing countries to take on commitments to reduce emissions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has said it would not agree to legally binding targets until their nature and content and implications for Australia are clear. We will not agree to any targets that impose substantial costs on Australia that are not faced by other OECD countries.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Conclusions</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the package of measures I have announced today, the government is not posturing for negotiating purposes with theoretical targets but is already taking practical steps to reduce Australia's greenhouse gas emissions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a package that goes well beyond what any previous government has sought to do. It is a package that puts Australia at the forefront of international action. And it is a package that Australia will implement even if the international community fails to reach agreement at Kyoto.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have demonstrated to date, my government will continue to stand up for the Australian national interest, jobs and economy in the international negotiations.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10927">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will not agree to an outcome that burdens Australia and Australians in an unfair manner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My government has had some success in our efforts to argue the case that an effective result at Kyoto will require an equitable approach. We have managed to shift the international debate. As a result of our efforts, there is greater recognition of the need to take into account individual national circumstances if there is to be a successful outcome&mdash;as the British Prime Minister, Mr Blair, acknowledged to me in our recent discussions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also greater recognition of the need for flexibility to ensure countries can make a contribution to the global effort.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the South Pacific Forum and most recently at CHOGM we were successful in gaining acceptance of the need for global engagement by both developed and developing countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nevertheless, let there be no doubt the Kyoto negotiations will be very difficult.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia's environment minister, Senator Robert Hill, who will be leading our delegation at Kyoto, will be doing his utmost to secure an agreement that will both be fair and equitable to Australia and Australians and be effective in reducing global emissions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ultimately, the success of our domestic measures depends upon the goodwill, commitment and action by ordinary Australians, consumers, farmers, families, firms and industry groups, as well as governments federal, state, and local. The greenhouse challenge is theirs and quality of life of our children depends upon their strength of purpose.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House for that extension of time. That was a modest, frightened little effort, witnessed by a very modest proportion of the government's back bench and ministry. We had more people in this chamber to witness the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) than he bothered to have himself. Apart from the rostered ranks of the myrmidons to sit behind him for the purposes of television tonight, there was nobody here. I have to say for the government's back bench that they exercised sounder judgment than we did.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will get to the dimensions of the domestic fig leaf contained in this statement a little later, but what is the central problem for this government and this nation now? It is this: nobody internationally and very few people domestically believe that this Prime Minister and this government consider that greenhouse gas emissions are a substantial environmental, economic and social problem. They do not think that because they have witnessed the deeds of this government and listened to the words of this government for the last 18 months; deeds and words which have gone into partial reversal during the course of the Prime Minister's statements. The deeds have been the annihilation of just about all greenhouse gas related programs funded by this government. The words have cast doubt on the science which is now virtually universally accepted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only statesman internationally who is arguing that way is the Prime Minister of this country. When he goes&mdash;or when his representative goes to Kyoto; he does not go himself&mdash;he carries the baggage of a massive philosophical handicap in the perception of the people he will be dealing with. He will start a long way behind; but, to protect the interests of this nation and to protect the interests of future generations, he has to go a long way ahead. He has been given a darned near impossible task.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had 18 months of casting doubt on the science and 18 months in which we have been told about the loss of 90,000 jobs if this 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10928"> Prime Minister's objectives are not pursued. I think the time has come to analyse the figures and reflect on this. The loss of those 90,000 jobs, which are supposedly going to be lost over the best part of a decade, has been complained about by a Prime Minister who has managed to knock off 50,000 full&hyphen;time jobs in 18 months. That puts it in some perspective: 90,000 jobs over the best part of a decade&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="KERR" NAMEID="RH4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RH4">Mr Kerr</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Potential jobs.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Potential jobs&mdash;and 50,000 actual full&hyphen;time jobs that have gone out the back door since this government has been in office over the last 18 months. That is the perspective.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is this 90,000 jobs study that we are all supposed to bow before? The automaticity of this has been asserted in the shorthand statements by the government. When you actually look at their figures, this is surrounded by the most impossible set of worst case scenarios associated with it. The figure of 90,000 jobs comes from an assessment or a survey of all the state governments of all the projects over $100 million that might be in the pipeline over the period of time that we are considering&mdash;the next 10 years. We all know, from our own experience, the percentage of these projects that actually go ahead. It is the best case wish list to produce the worst case scenario.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What do we get from this $68 billion? The final decision on whether these projects will proceed will be made in the next five years. If all projects proceeded&mdash;the whole darn lot&mdash;it is estimated that around 90,000 long&hyphen;term jobs `may' be created, with additional short&hyphen;term jobs in the construction phase. The assumption of this 90,000 has been waved like a banner before the Australian people. The problems that are going to be created by greenhouse gas emissions have not been waved like a banner; it is the 90,000 jobs that have been waved like a banner in front of the faces of the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The chances of those projects going ahead in all the best possible circumstances to produce that total is the most optimistic scenario. The notion that, if we sign up to any set of targets, 90,000 jobs would be lost is the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> most pessimistic scenario. But what we do know about this government is that its record of job creation has knocked off more than half of these full&hyphen;time jobs in 18 months. Let us all get that in perspective. These are bogus numbers for the purpose of debate. They are there for the purpose of debate, not for the purpose of serious analysis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the circumstance in which all of these projects will disappear, or might all disappear, according to this? It is the adoption of the European optimal target. That is basically the circumstance which would create it. Not a single nation on this earth believes that whatever emerges from Kyoto is going to be the European optimal target. Not one nation on earth believes that&mdash;but it is an underlying assumption for the creation of this figure of 90,000 full&hyphen;time job losses. Nobody in Europe believes that that particular European target is going to be the target created.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have heard today is that Labor's programs on energy and the environment were the solution. We heard of the value of all of our initiatives with the states. There is no acknowledgment, but the negotiations with the states that he has announced have been going on for ages, and the programs associated with them for some considerable time. The Prime Minister acknowledges the efforts of business in relation to the greenhouse challenge. So do we&mdash;who set it up? That has been announced again without any accreditation. He acknowledges the significance of the regional forest agreements. Thanks a lot. When we were setting down the principles for all of that over the course of the last four or five years and we were arguing the case and the needs, including in relation to their potential impact on greenhouse gas emissions, what were they doing in opposition? They were saying that we were trying to destroy jobs&mdash;that is what they were doing. They were opposing what we were doing on regional forest agreements, and now he wraps himself in the flag of regional forest agreements to give himself some ice to skate on as far as this agreement is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, we come to the extraordinary admission that, after all the scaremongering about 90,000 jobs, the greenhouse abatement 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10929"> measures can create jobs. Here we have a new logic. All of the Labor Party's efforts on the regional forest agreements and on the research programs and everything else, all of the Labor Party's efforts in what produced much greater business efficiencies as they took up greenhouse challenge opportunities, did not create jobs. But when the government does the same, they do create jobs. That is the new logic of this government for the purpose of debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have here&mdash;and I suppose we ought to be grateful for it&mdash;is that, in building on the programs that we put in place and that he destroyed, the government has created for itself a fig leaf. It is a fig leaf of which the Prime Minister was inordinately proud in his presentation here today. Here, in this issue, is a defining challenge for world political leadership. Greenhouse gas emissions do not respect national borders. The problem resists easy solution; it requires energy, unity, purpose and courage. The Prime Minister and this government have greeted it with their customary withering incompetence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two problems here: the Prime Minister's manifestly inadequate effort on a domestic abatement strategy&mdash;I will get to that later&mdash;and his incompetence in international negotiations. The government's one&hyphen;chord symphony on greenhouse for over a year has been differentiation. We have no problem with that as an idea&mdash;but differentiation from what? Where is Australia's target? We have a weak and sneaky position here on a target. The restored Labor programs can cut growth in emissions by a third by 2010, he tells us. Indeed, he tells us a lot more and we would agree; they would cut them by an awful lot more than one&hyphen;third if those Labor initiatives are properly implemented and followed through. But he will not sign up to any target. And he has only announced this reinstatement nine days before the Kyoto conference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem is that the government cannot walk away from a target. They are on the record. The Prime Minister himself said, on 6 October this year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To deliver that outcome&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is, a good greenhouse result&mdash;</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">

<PARA STYLE="Para">Senator Hill, the Minister for the Environment, and Mr Downer, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, are also on the record. Senator Hill said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Obviously it requires differentiated targets. Our proposal is to negotiate individual country targets. Realistic targets are part of the Kyoto negotiations. They help ensure compliance which in turn leads to better environmental outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Howard said that to deliver the outcome of a good greenhouse result requires different targets for different situations. What is the target that you can discern in all of this? Targets have not really been set in this statement. There is no comparison against another proposition and a statement, `I will take that forward and that will be the argument I will be presenting.' The best you can do, looking through all of this, is that Senator Hill will go to Kyoto and state, `We do not have a view on an international target and our contribution to the massive problem that you are all confronting is to increase emissions by 20 per cent. That is our target.' That is a good starting point for the discussions to establish and restore credibility to defend the Australian national interest as he sits himself down with his colleagues!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where is the government's target for the international position? It does not like the European one. Fine, we do not like it either. It does not like the Japanese one of a five per cent reduction on 1990 levels by 2010. It does not endorse the US target of 1990 levels by 2008&hyphen;2012. It does not like the opposition's one, which is very similar to that of the US: stabilisation at 1990 levels by 2010. So what target does it want? A small tip: if you are going to negotiate a target, you had better have one by the time you turn up there. It is not a bad idea.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Commentators hint sagely that the government is protecting its negotiating position for Kyoto. The government nods, similarly sagely, and says, `Yes, that is what we are doing. We are protecting our negotiating position for Kyoto.' Sorry, we sit opposite the government every day, we have an opportunity to observe it at play and we know it better than that. It is always a safe assumption with 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10930"> this government that if its speech bubble is blank its thought bubble is blank as well. So often, even when the speech bubble is overflowing the thought bubble is still blank.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said before that the Prime Minister is clutching for a fig leaf with this announcement today. Having happily shed greenhouse programs in the last two budgets, just as the international debate has been intensifying towards Kyoto, the Prime Minister has been a man desperately in search of cover. This is why we have seen the spectacle, whenever anybody softens their position on greenhouse by the slightest amount, of the Prime Minister out there with a pathetic claim that somehow or other they were influenced by Australia. Where has Australia's dignity gone when the Prime Minister has to drag himself around the world like Orphan Annie, pleading with people that we should not be flogged? He sent Australia begging to the South Pacific forum; he had us begging at CHOGM. While all of this pleading has been going on, where has the groundwork been to lock in a decent international regime?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the first time the Prime Minister included in a speech a number of the elements of a decent international regime, which are actually critical to this country but which other people do not necessarily hold as an appropriate course to be followed by countries that are making a contribution because they, in many ways, reflect that differentiated and unique Australian contribution and possibility. They are utterly critical for us to get up at Kyoto. If we are going to meet any set of targets, mandatory or anything else, then if these issues are not accepted we are going to be in diabolical trouble.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a very important negotiating task to be done by the Prime Minister in this regard. The Prime Minister is evidently determined to put the Minister for the Environment in a position where he is going to do this very difficult negotiating with only fig leaf protection to start his bargaining position. Where has the groundwork been on the inclusion of carbon sinks, for example, in the global abatement equation? We must have the opportunity to address our target by reafforestation programs, like Labor's one billion 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> trees. These are programs which can also provide valuable employment opportunities for our young unemployed, control of soil erosion and relief of pressure on our native forests by providing an expanded timber resource stream to ensure continuing opportunity for our forestry and timber industries. The Prime Minister indirectly talked about those sorts of things. These are not issues that the Europeans will regard as appropriate and I do not think the Americans are all that interested. Certainly nobody in Asia, where they want to chop the trees down, is too keen on having these things credited. But if we do not get them credited, we are in trouble.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no useful global agreement which does not include developing countries. We agree with the Prime Minister on that. They can be brought in by allowing joint implementation of greenhouse reduction measures in developing countries, funded by developed countries like Australia, where we can claim recognition against our greenhouse gas reduction targets for undertaking such measures. The whole effect of the Prime Minister's posture on this point has been to note that no agreement works without the Third World being brought into the process in some way, but his stance internationally has been to encourage them not to think about it&mdash;to encourage them not to arrive at conclusions. Where are we going to go when we want the credits for that? We also need credit for our highly efficient production processes, particularly in energy intensive industries such as aluminium smelting. By locating this kind of activity here using efficient processes rather than offshore using less efficient processes, we should get credit for the global emissions we save.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What sort of credit are we going to get for this vitally important argument if we turn up in Kyoto and say, `We've sort of got a target, team. It is sort of to increase by 20 per cent. While we are increasing by 20 per cent, will you kindly recognise the carbon sinks? Will you please recognise our capacity in regard to other people's energy intensive production here? Will you kindly recognise that, if you produce aluminium in Australia, you are going to put yourself in a situation where you 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10931"> get a bit of a credit for that exercise?' I do not think so, I am afraid. This is a negotiating strategy which beggars belief. In fact all of John Howard's posturing has encouraged developing countries to try and stay out. That is a recipe for failure at Kyoto.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let there be no mistake about what the Prime Minister has done here today. He is just announced that he will fill in just under half of hole he dug himself in his two budgets. Here is the simple equation: $400 million dollars of Labor's programs cut; $180 million back in&mdash;the John Howard greenhouse equation. To mix a metaphor, we all know what happens when you get only halfway through a backflip, you land on your head.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">we think that the ideas he has offered up today are perfectly laudable. They are good ideas and there is a reason for my saying that&mdash;because we recognise with them some pride of authorship. Let me go through what was cut out before anything was replaced today: the abolition of the Energy Research and Development Corporation, a cut of $37.7 million, seriously threatening the development and commercialisation of innovative new and renewable energy projects, and I might say a direct breach of a coalition election commitment; the slashing of funding to the national energy efficiency program to the tune of $14 million over four years, which meant substantially less money for the raft of energy efficiency programs and the termination of the enterprise energy audit program&mdash;audit program reinstated; cutting funding to the national greenhouse research program by $1.6 million and the national pollution inventory by $600,000; slashing funding to the cooperative research centres by $10 million over the next two years, leaving the future of centres like the renewable energy CRC in Perth shaky; and abolishing the Labor government's one billion trees program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Together these cuts represent a direct cut of $100 million from Labor Party's greenhouse abatement and related programs. In addition, the government abolished the LEAP program and thereby abandoned the chance to train young people for jobs that assist in greenhouse abatement. That was a cut of $300 million. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA STYLE="Para">Let us look at what has been put in place in just a couple of areas. We have a total of $13.5 million in energy programs on greenhouse. One is accelerating energy market reform. Thanks very much; we started that in 1991. How much did John Howard cut out of Labor's national energy efficiency program? Fourteen million dollars&mdash;$14 million out; $13.5 million back in. We have $61.4 million on renewable energy programs&mdash;very laudable measures. We know because we set up the Energy Research and Development Corporation, the ERDC, which John Howard abolished, cutting $37 million. Now he has incentives, loans and grants to get into renewable energy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But how many of those research projects will have survived in the interim? The research base has been all but stripped away and we are back to square one. All those loan schemes and the others related to them are to develop decent research, but you cannot develop a darned thing if you actually have not done the research to start off with. If the research base has been stripped away, all that loan money sits out there marking time waiting for somebody to do it again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has put in place $40 million into its Green Corps. Put that in the context of $300 million ripped out by abolishing LEAP. The better cities program and all its associated programs on encouraging public transport were cut out by this government. This document does not mention public transport once. This government re&hyphen;announces a $2 million program for an ethanol pilot plant, the same government that abolished the ethanol bounty in 1996&mdash;a $21 million dollar cut. Ten steps backwards; one step forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one new thing in their propositions which is genuinely new and with which we agree, and that is the mandatory targets for the uptake of renewable energy in power supplies in which they talk about electricity retailers and other large electricity buyers being legally required to source an additional two per cent of electricity from renewable or specified waste product energy sources. That is a good idea. It is a new idea, but it is a small idea in what is proposed to be its 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10932"> targets when compared with others who have taken up something similar.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Contrast that with the operations established by the New South Wales government along those sorts of lines, where they estimate over the next few years that 7 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emitted material will be taken out of the atmosphere by CEDA's project&mdash;an operation headed up by a person who was once Clinton's environmental adviser and is very good indeed. Apply that around Australia and you get 30 million tonnes and start to address some of the sorts of problems that they are talking about here. This is a bagatelle in comparison to that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much is made of the fact that we are highly dependent upon fossil fuels, and indeed we are. But some are more dependent on coal&mdash;which is the most problematic of the fossil fuels in relation to this&mdash;than we are, for example Denmark, which gets a bit of a guernsey under other headings in the Prime Minister's statements about the performance of Europe. They are much more dependent on coal than we are. What is their target in relation to new renewable energy sources? It is 10 to 14 per cent over the same period, not two per cent. What has Denmark done? Denmark has made use of technologies in which we should be streets ahead of them such as the effective use of wind power. What is the consequence of that? It is that the export of electricity generated by wind power from Denmark now exceeds the value of their fish exports. That is a very interesting prospect and possibility. So it is a good idea, but not ambitious enough in terms of the objectives set for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have said that Australia has to go to Kyoto with a target and we have proposed one. We do not agree with the EU position. We think it is unfair and self-serving. Bill Clinton has announced the US will sign up to a target of 1990 based emission levels by 2008 to 2012. Everyone knows that Kyoto will not produce a consensus less stringent than that one, if it produces one, particularly as the other majors, Japan and the Europe Union, are pushing stricter targets still. Labor believes that Australia should go to Kyoto with a starting point negotiating position 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> which accepts an international target to which we could agree of stabilising greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels by 2010. But the opposition has said all along that differentiation is a fair argument for Australia, but differentiation must have a target to argue for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We see no imagination from this Prime Minister, only borrowed imagination from Labor. Where, for example, is there some decent thinking on tradeable emissions permits? Professor Warwick McKibbin, an Australian working out of the Brookings Institute in the US, has proposed the development in each country of a domestic system of tradeable emission credits designed to encourage the most economically efficient developments to meet internationally determined greenhouse reduction targets. The volume of credits issued in each country would be determined initially and over future years within each country, but would clearly need to be within the parameters set by the international community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If mandatory targets are set at Kyoto, it is important that we have a considered economically credible, environmentally sustainable method of achieving the goal. I do not endorse every element of Professor McKibbin's proposal. It needs to be rigorously examined and explored to consider some very practical concerns about new investment, particularly investment in new greenhouse efficient industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do have to be prepared for the possibility that agreement might fail at Kyoto. There are vast disagreements between the parties and this is an environment now where international negotiation is proceeding slower than it was some years ago. It may well be, therefore, that all that is set down at Kyoto are further processes to take the matter forward. If that is the case, it will be sad. If that is the case, we will have made a contribution to that particular outcome in the way in which we have behaved over the last 18 months, and that is no point of pride. It may be a matter of some satisfaction to the Prime Minister, but it will be no matter of satisfaction to his kids or mine and, if that occurs, it will be a disaster for their kids, our grandchildren. We should have gone to Kyoto as a proud country 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10933"> with a real appreciation of the needs in this particular area; we go to Kyoto with a minor fig leaf and a bad reputation. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to lend my strong support to the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) Bill 1997. This is yet another example of our government's commonsense, practical agenda for reform and long&hyphen;term vision. The youth allowance will replace the youth training allowance, the newstart allowance and the sickness allowance for 16&hyphen; to 20&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds and most 15&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds currently covered by these payments. It will replace Austudy for students aged between 16 and 24 and older, if students commence a course prior to turning 25 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation reflects well the government's position on social security. This government stands for social security, as distinct from welfare. As a member of this government, I am a strong advocate of state responsibility to be taken for the welfare of those who are in genuine need. As a parent, I support this government's philosophy that families are the glue that holds our society together and that parents, not the state, should be primarily responsible for the welfare of their children. The government's role is to provide a safe environment where people are not forced to resort to crime to support themselves in desperate times. The role of the family is to provide for the welfare of its young.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has made it clear through the youth allowance legislation that it intends to hold to this principle. This government aims to help families. The parenting means test will encourage families to support their children until they have achieved full independence. Under the current system, the minimum rate family payment is paid to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> eligible families only until their children's sixteenth birthday. Under the youth allowance system, families who meet the income test for the family tax initiative and the minimum rate family payment, but whose income excludes their children from receiving youth allowance, will be able to claim both the family tax initiative and the minimum rate family payment in respect of those children until they turn 18 years of age.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is our families that teach us core values like  responsibility, that nurture our sense of self&hyphen;esteem and engender a strong work ethic. When people receive support from parents or their family they are more inclined to appreciate the sacrifices made for them and they are more keen to give something back. The same compulsion unfortunately is not at work in our extended family, the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that there is a core of social security recipients who do not want to be part of that group. Unfortunately, there is an increasingly large pool of young people who do not appreciate the sacrifices made by their providers, the taxpayers, and who have no qualms about withdrawing from a seemingly bottomless pit of government funds. Through having no direct contact with their sponsors, welfare recipients do not appreciate to the same extent the link between the taxpayer and consolidated revenue. They are not learning to do all they can for themselves before seeking assistance. They will not be able to look back with the same sense of pride of their achievements if this situation continues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is surely no way to raise our youth and moreover will spell their financial as well as spiritual bankruptcy in decades to come. Families can nurture young people, whereas the state can only sustain them. One particular case in my electorate draws this distinction between sustenance and nurturing extremely well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite a number of very distraught parents have come into my office at different times complaining about the fact that the process at the moment actually encourages youngsters to leave home. These parents really have no control over whether or not this happens. It causes a great amount of grief and concern to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10934"> the parents involved and, as a consequence, causes a lot of damage to a lot of these children&mdash;they are only young children aged 14 and 15&mdash;who leave home. In a lot of cases they leave home because they are not happy with the family imposing what are not unreasonable restrictions in accordance with their age and in the best interests of the children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One particular case I would like to highlight is that of a 15-year-old lass from my electorate who had developed a relationship with a young man. The parents did not approve of that relationship, given her age and the problems associated with the young man in question. They put fairly severe restrictions on her access to that fellow. She objected to this and actually spoke with a school counsellor to complain about the restrictions that were put on her at home. She was looking for options that may be available to her.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this case there was no suggestion that the child was in any way being abused or neglected by the family. She came from a very loving and caring family that was really working very much in her interests. They were concerned very much for her future. Through access to this counsellor she was given advice that she could leave home and apply for social security so she could be independent. She was assisted in finding accommodation. So she left her home to continue the relationship with this young man.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Away from the home this girl soon got herself into very serious trouble. She was involved in drugs, her schooling certainly deteriorated significantly and unfortunately she fell pregnant. She also got herself into trouble with the law. She then went to what I would call her surrogate parent&mdash;the counsellor who had been assisting her with her independence&mdash;and asked her for advice on how to deal with this problem. The advice that was given to her by this caring counsellor was that she should have an abortion. This went very much against what this girl had been taught by her parents, and it was something that bothered her immensely. As a consequence, she refused this option on moral grounds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This girl was then told by the counsellor that there was no more that she could do and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the best thing that she could do was, in effect, go back to her parents. She went back home and spoke to her parents. They of course accepted her back. She had a drug problem and she was pregnant. She had no hesitation whatsoever in going back but it certainly was a very painful lesson to this young lass. She learnt about the caring nature of her family and the difference between dealing with the welfare counsellors as such and being in a caring and loving family home. I think it highlights very much the difference between the two. Fortunately she went on and had the child. She kept the child. She has beaten her drug problem. She is now working towards a full and meaningful life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite frankly, this situation may never have needed to happen if there was something in place that could have allowed the parents to ensure that that child stayed in the home and also if there was no mechanism allowed in this case to encourage her to leave and try to have some sort of independence to do as she chose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor provided financial incentives for many young people to leave school and go on the dole. Youth unemployment increased a staggering 32.2 per cent, to an employment figure more than five per cent higher than when they first came to office. Under Labor the number of apprenticeships fell to the lowest level in some 30 years. In 1972-73 spending on social welfare was 7.6 per cent of gross domestic product. It is now more than 15 per cent. Independent studies by the Australian Council of Social Service found that 20 years ago 12 per cent of our adult population received benefits or pensions. Today the figure is a staggering 23 per cent, or over 3 million people. Nearly one-quarter of all Australians are solely dependent on government welfare to survive. Quite frankly, this welfare alliance is totally unsustainable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For Australia to advance as a productive and internationally competitive nation, we must instil in our children a sense of mutual obligation. The government is obliged to support young people who make the effort to work towards their long-term independence through training, higher education or simply through looking for work. The youth allow 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="10935"> ance measures will build on the good start we have made. Under the coalition there will be 100,000 new apprenticeships and traineeships. We will provide income support to young people, including students, those looking for work and those who are sick and not capable of doing so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Young Australians must accept that they will not be able to leave education or training easily just to yet the youth allowance. This government will give support to people who strive to support themselves. This legislation gives greater flexibility to students to take advantage of opportunities that exist for young people today to study and work part-time to a greater extent than students of my generation. To be eligible for the youth allowance, young people must be engaged in one or a number of activities: they must be looking for full-time employment, studying full time, undertaking a course of vocational training or undertaking an approved combination of part-time activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those who must move away from the home to pursue higher education will be paid rent assistance, as will those 10,000 young people who are genuinely homeless or totally independent. These young people studying full-time who are eligible for Austudy at present will receive a level of youth allowance equivalent to what they receive now. Many others will also receive rent assistance in addition. A young person of 18 living away from home can be eligible for a maximum of $264.70 in Austudy per fortnight at present. Come 1 July next  year the benefit will be significantly increased with the addition of rent assistance. The maximum rent assistance payable is $98.80 per fortnight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is particularly good news for those families who live in remote and rural areas such as Coen, Laura, Cooktown and the Torres Strait, which constitutes a very large portion of my electorate, and depend on schools miles away from their homes for the education of their children. The youth allowance will certainly be a significant plus in this area. Rent assistance will make their children's accommodation far more affordable and enable them to concentrate on studies and improving their grades. This in turn will be a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> big relief for their parents, many of whom are really struggling to get by.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, people in regional areas who are currently excluded from certain university courses because there is insufficient demand at their local campus will be assisted by the federal government to study at larger campuses where the demand does exist. People in remote areas therefore will be afforded opportunity more equal to those for students whose family homes are in urban areas. I was able to pass on this particularly good news recently to a constituent who had informed me about her son, who wants to study law after leaving school but could not do so in the Cairns campus of James Cook University because the faculty was not available. It looked like he would not be able to take up that opportunity because of the financial circumstances of his parents. Under this new allowance they will certainly be able to access the appropriate university and the courses that will enable him to fulfil his ambitions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think there is still a lot more that we have to do with regards to support for regional, remote and rural students. There are still quite a number of significant areas that have to be addressed. I am confident that in the passing of time we will continue to expand on these areas to ensure that we afford the students in these areas of Australia the same opportunities that are being offered to students in metropolitan areas where there is far greater access to a much broader range of services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will be abolishing the $1,000 minimum payment because we appreciate that there are a lot of young people out there who should get our help but who may not be entitled to more than $1,000. To people with solid full-time employment, this sum may not seem much, but I can assure the House that it will be of tremendous benefit to a great number of people in my electorate. Students will no longer need to work for three years to be classified as independent. The criteria will now be a person who has lived independently from their family home for more than 18 months. I believe that this is certainly far more reasonable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The measures implemented by the youth allowance legislation will not affect those 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10936"> young people who are in genuine need of living away from parents because of personal danger, nor will it affect the level of support given to existing recipients.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 6 November I announced that the Cairns Centrelink call centre in my electorate of Leichhardt was to benefit from the creation of some 45 new positions as a result of the government's program for expanding this service in a number of call centres around the country. Under the direction of Peter Doutre and Kris Vleeshouwer, the Centrelink team has had great success in serving Far North Queensland across a whole range of social security programs. Given the positive response to the establishment of the one stop shop concept for social security, I am anticipating that the simplification which the youth allowance brings to the social security system will be met with equal enthusiasm.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The youth allowance will remove the necessity for young people to change the type of income support system that they rely upon when their circumstances change. At present there is a great deal of public concern about the current fragmentation of income support for young people between the departments&mdash;concern which will be removed by centralising the system of income support into one system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is clear that these are very positive measures. Parents in this country should be pleased that the government has focused on family based social security. Young people should be relieved that the system is finally being simplified. All Australians should be optimistic that the changes are being introduced to ensure that our young people have the appreciation of the mutual obligation so crucial to their long-term prospects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These measures will also encourage young people to maximise their opportunities in the education field. A previous speaker commented on the fact that there is not always a need for highly qualified tertiary outcomes and there is a whole range of other skills that are appropriate and needed within the community. As an employer myself for many years, I looked at the actual hands-on skills that people had when assessing their suitability to work with me.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find that these measures are going to give a lot of our young people opportunities and an incentive to continue to access services, be they TAFE, apprenticeships or any other form of training, to give them the best possible opportunity of obtaining long-term and meaningful employment and contributing to our community as a whole. I certainly commend this bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill concerning youth allowance will follow on and, in some cases, act in parallel with the package of measures this government has already introduced. It will build on measures put in place by the Howard government and will give hope to young Australians who for 13 years under the previous Labor government were promised much but delivered very little. The Labor Party deserves the scorn of young people, as it lengthened the CES queues and brought the merry&hyphen;go&hyphen;round of all those wonderful Clayton's training programs which they dished out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The family tax initiative gave families a real break, and we have lowered interest rates which has been a major bonus for mortgage payments. We also have introduced things such as work for the dole, school to industry links, apprenticeships and the Green Corps, which have been extremely warmly welcomed throughout my electorate of Petrie and the whole of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Green Corps project has been a huge hit, particularly in my electorate of Petrie. It was recently my very great pleasure to congratulate those who were involved in the first Green Corps project in the Petrie electorate, which was launched in the Bracken Ridge area of my electorate. The Green Corps project at Tinchi Tamba Wetlands and Deepwater Bend was one of the first projects to be chosen under the Green Corps program, and

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I raise the benefits of this program because I wish to make the point that it is one of the decisive outcomes that has arisen out of the Green Corps program, and out of that has come something really special: the hope and opportunities which it has given to the participants. There has been a huge improvement in these young people's confidence and self&hyphen;esteem. In fact, the changes in six months were overwhelming. I attended a presentation by them only last week and it was absolutely inspiring.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The trainees are now talking about going on to university or TAFE courses. They are talking about careers in environmental science, in park preservation, in landscaping and as park rangers. Those young people had absolutely no opportunities open to them before they started this program. It has made them much more focused on their futures. It has given them a chance to see beyond the greater realm of things, to achieve something and to aspire to greater things in the future. Nearly all of these young people will qualify, and they will benefit from the government's foresight and particularly benefit from this youth allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill gives legislative effect to a new social security allowance, commencing on 1 July 1998, which is an income support payment for young people who are in education, in training, unemployed or sick. It allows young people to have a real choice and to have a better overall understanding of the entitlements and guidelines which exist. The youth allowance, in essence, takes away the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> inconsistencies which exist in the present system, and it allows a far more flexible approach. It is a much simpler system than has existed in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the most important features of the proposal is the consistency of payments if circumstances alter slightly. Previously this would have meant cancelling one allowance, applying for another allowance and having to wait in between. It was very complicated. There were delays, frustration, consternation and confusion, all of which will be alleviated by this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to reiterate that the youth allowance will replace five existing, but different, payments. It will replace Austudy for students under 25 years of age&mdash;and older if the student commences a course prior to turning 25&mdash;and 15&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds currently covered under the Austudy arrangements. It will replace youth training, newstart and sickness allowances for under 21&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds and, more importantly, the minimum rate family payment for secondary students aged 16 to 18 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Youth allowance provides better support for families, and it will provide a much simpler approach to the payment of these allowances. It also provides clarification of the range of payments that exist between Centrelink and the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that one of the most important aspects of the bill is that it will encourage more young people to complete further education and training, particularly those young people who thought that they would never really have a chance. The government has given people a real chance and a real opportunity. The importance of good and thorough education should never be underestimated. I refer to not just the knowledge attained but also the wonderful things that come from education and knowledge, such as social and interactive skills and the people who we meet throughout the education process. Education is something that stays with us throughout life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I meet many people in the course of my day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day activities in my electorate who have never finished high school, and it is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10938"> really quite tragic when you talk to them. Many of them are filled with regret. A lot of them go back to the school system as adults, and it is pretty courageous of them to do that, particularly when they are a lot older than the students who are there. They undertake studies with young teenagers because they want to get on in life, they want to go further and they realise how much they missed out on by not completing grade 12. I think it is really courageous of them to go back.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are doing here is encouraging young people to stay at school, and what is wrong with that? It is so much harder when they have to go back as adults and do night school. There is nothing more demoralising. The people I meet who do that do brilliantly, and I am absolutely thrilled when I hear the great success stories when I meet up with them a few years down the track.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The youth allowance will encourage young people to look at options in education and training. There will be real incentives for young people to complete year 12. The world is changing. We have changing technologies and increases in new areas that we never thought were possible. The industries include IT, tourism and finance, and new skills are needed for these&mdash;skills that were not needed in the past. It saddens me to see many young people who are not in education or training living in game and pinball parlours. There is nothing worse than seeing young teenagers while away their hours in game parlours. It is a waste of talent. Now there is more direction for them and more scope for them to go on to school and training opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The youth allowance will keep families together and discourage young people from leaving home. Today the member for Leichhardt (Mr Entsch) told a very tragic story about how a young woman's life was changed by making the wrong decision  and leaving home. That decision impacted on her and caused her severe grief in many other areas. We need to work towards alternatives to the inactivity in our society: young people who drop out of school for nothing and live a life without purpose and without direction. It is very important for this government to stop young people from choosing to go on unem 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ployment benefits over education and training. We need to encourage them to stay at school. Why do we need to do this? We need to do it because, if we do not, the threat of intergenerational poverty will hang like a cloud. It has to be dispersed. We have to break that poverty cycle. That is what we are on about, and what is wrong with that? What is wrong with giving kids an opportunity?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Education is a way out of poverty, and we all know that. In order to escape this, we need to educate our young people. The Howard government is trying to rectify this situation. The encouragement of apprenticeships, the school to industry links program and opportunities provided through the youth allowance are now coming together and forming a package which will be seen as very fair, equitable and just.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to note that the youth allowance has been brought forward by this government following concerns expressed by young people, their families and the general community. They were all calling for reform. For the last 13 years, under Labor, their voices were lost. They were not heard. It has taken a coalition government&mdash;the first Howard government&mdash;to listen and to act to ensure that another generation is not lost but grows and prospers on their achievements, ideas and goals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At this point, I wish to note for the record some of the positive aspects of the bill. To qualify for the youth allowance, young people aged 18 and over will need to be undertaking full&hyphen;time study, training, jobsearch or a combination of these activities. For those under 18, youth allowance payments will depend on them participating in full&hyphen;time education or training, unless they meet the criteria for special exemptions, such as being ill, homeless or unable to secure an appropriate education or training place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Youth allowance will be calculated on a daily basis and paid fortnightly. It is not until you hear the figures&mdash;the people who will benefit from the youth allowance&mdash;that you begin to get a clear picture and an appreciation of the importance and impact of this legislation for young people right across Australia. The extension of rent assistance 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10939"> will benefit 70,000 students. It will help people in rural and remote communities to have access where they did not have it before. Today I discovered that rural students have the lowest take&hyphen;up rate of further education places of any group in the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The abolition of the $1,000 per annum Austudy minimum entitlement requirement will benefit 41,200 students, and changes to the Austudy independent rate will assist upwards of 16,600 students. The maximum rate for students aged under 18 who are away from home will rise, benefiting over 19,500 students, and 9,300 students over 25 who will be continuing study will benefit from the alignment of these rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The youth allowance is a commendable decision. It will benefit young people in the electorate of Petrie enormously, and it will support the many other initiatives which assist young people in this important age group. What is more important is that it is giving young people an opportunity. It is giving them a chance. It is about families taking responsibility for their children's lives. It is about encouraging them to go on and further their education. It is about giving them a real opportunity and it is a positive step. It is a step that will shape the future of this country and give our young people opportunities that they had before and never dreamed about. It will give them so much more to look forward to, particularly in the changing technologies that we face leading into the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The technologies of the past are changing and the way that work is structured is changing. People today will need more sophisticated skills and they will need to benefit from training programs. This is what this is all about. It is about giving young people a chance, it is about giving young people an opportunity and it is about them looking forward into the future. It is about giving them hope where they never had that hope, and it is about providing some future for them that will enable them to lead meaningful lives. I want to reiterate that it will get them out of that intergenerational poverty of which we spoke a moment ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very pleased to speak to this bill. I am pleased at the initiative the government is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> taking. It will be a very positive step for Australia, it will be a positive step for families, it will encourage our young people, it will lead them to continue well into the future and it will provide a very prosperous future for us all.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Naturally, I do not comment about matters that take place in my party room&mdash;any more than you do. Can I take the opportunity, because the Leader of the Opposition has raised an important issue, of saying something about the role of the Australian churches in the native title debate. Over the past few days the role of the churches has been commented upon, and there have even been some suggestions that I do not believe that church figures should participate in the debate about amendments to the Native 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10940"> Title Act. Those suggestions are completely wrong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a very deep respect for the role of the churches in Australian society. Personally, I have very strongly identified, since I have been Prime Minister, with expressions by church figures on important social issues such as euthanasia, domestic violence and excessive gambling. And I have always defended the right of church figures to speak out on issues they choose beyond those of a strictly religious character. The Leader of the Opposition may recall that, when I addressed the national Anglican conference at the beginning of this year, I in fact encouraged church leaders to participate in debate on important national issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the right to speak freely on a broad range of issues carries with it the obligation to speak in an informed, objective and constructive fashion. It also involves the right of others in the community to freely criticise the views of church figures if they do not accord with the facts or if they display undue bias. Importantly, there is also an obligation on church figures who do enter the debate not to allow the impression to be created that they speak on behalf of all adherents to their particular church or denomination. The truth is that the remarks of some church figures in the native title debate, particularly those suggesting racial motives on the part of the government, have given very, very deep offence to many active churchgoers throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Native Title Bill represents a fair compromise achieved by the government after months of negotiation with interested parties, including Aboriginal people and people of Torres Strait Islander descent.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It does not purport to extinguish native title or common law rights. Those who oppose our changes, for example, criticise the removal of the right to negotiate. The right to negotiate is not a common law right; it is a procedural right conferred by the Keating government under the Native Title Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the amending bill of the government is passed&mdash;and I want the Australian public to understand this very clearly&mdash;it will still be possible for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to make native title claims on 79 per cent of the landmass of Australia. At present, indigenous people, who represent two per cent of the population, own or control around 15 per cent of Australia's landmass. Additionally, there are native title claims over approximately 45 per cent of the landmass of Australia. When you add the other area over which native title claims can be made, you get to the figure of 79 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Additionally, under the Keating government's Native Title Act, Australian taxpayers are providing $1.3 billion to the Indigenous Land Fund to enable indigenous people who cannot make native title claims to purchase freehold or leasehold land. Like any other Australians, of course, individual indigenous people can purchase freehold land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In these circumstances, it is difficult to conceive of the factual basis on which some church figures, and indeed others, have variously attacked my government's legislation as being racist, discriminatory or immoral. My government remains strongly committed to the reconciliation process. We have clearly identified the removal of the profound disadvantage suffered by indigenous people in the area of health, education, employment and housing as the priority area on the issue of reconciliation. The attempt made by many to portray native title issues as the only element of reconciliation is both dishonest and neglectful of the true needs of indigenous people.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unlike alternative plans, to which I will come in a moment, this package, which adds to the massive investment in the environment contained in the Natural Heritage Trust, represents a balance between protecting Australian jobs&mdash;something the Labor Party will never do&mdash;protecting the resource sector of Australia and also making a very significant down payment on Australia's environmental future. Under the program we are providing $180 million, which will lift the performance of existing industries while also generating new green industries in renewable energy.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to say, in reply to the member for Wakefield, that when earlier this year I began to speak out strongly on behalf of Australia on the greenhouse gas emission issue I was met with nothing other than criticism and derision from the Australian Labor Party.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CT4">Mr COSTELLO</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for her question. As is, I think, well known, there has been substantive currency instability in the nations of South&hyphen;East Asia over recent months. Those economies which are most affected include Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines. Thailand and Indonesia are currently on adjustment programs with the International Monetary Fund. In response to some instability in South Korea, the trading ban limiting movements of the South Korean won was expanded to 10 per cent either side just recently. This morning, when trade opened on the South Korean won, it fell to the limit after 15 minutes of trading. I am aware of speculation about the possibility of the Korean government requesting IMF assistance. There has, however, been no official statement made either by that government or by the executive board of the IMF about this possibility.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The events in South-East Asia demonstrate again the importance for countries to ensure that they get sound economic fundamentals: a sophisticated and well&hyphen;regulated financial market, a currency which is open for trade and a monetary policy which emphasises stability. One of the things we can say in relation to Australia is that Australia has weathered this storm as well as it has because of this government's determination to get the economic fundamentals right. One thing we can say, even though we do not yet know the full extent of the volatility in the South-East Asian region, is that Australia faces that much 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10944"> better with a budget now coming back into balance, with a plan to retire debt, with the lowest inflation since the 1960s, with interest rates down at 20&hyphen; and 30&hyphen;year levels, and with a sound basis for improving competition in our domestic economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to both the Thai and the Indonesian packages put together by the International Monetary Fund, Australia has been a participant in each. In relation to the Indonesian package, Australia is part of a second tier of financial accommodation which will be made available if the first tier put together by the IMF, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank needs supplementation. In relation to that and in relation to Thailand, the Australian government's contribution is by way of loan. The money is made available in return for structural adjustment packages in those countries, and after those structural adjustment packages have been put in place the money will be repaid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Developments in relation to the four countries of ASEAN will have an effect on the Australian economy, as I have already said. I have also said that, if the instability moved into North Asia, that would have a further impact in relation to the Australian economy. It is important to emphasise, however, that the ASEAN economies most affected by this instability take only around 10 per cent of Australia's exports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be a meeting of ASEAN finance ministers, together with those countries participating in the Thai package and the United States, in Kuala Lumpur in about 10 days time which I will be attending on behalf of Australia. It is expected that the finance ministers will discuss developments in the region and put in place surveillance mechanisms which will enhance surveillance and regional cooperation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia is part of the IMF packages in relation to both Thailand and Indonesia not only because it is in the interests of those countries but also because it is in the interests of Australia. It is in the interests of Australia to see the countries in our region stabilised and returned to growth. Growth in our region aids Australia, just as a downturn in our region will have an adverse effect on our 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> economy. The Australian government continues to monitor the developments in South Korea and will look at any requests or any involvement which the IMF may make if such a request is forthcoming.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. I am pleased to inform him and the House that the government is in a position now to finally release the prices under the therapeutic group pre 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="10945"> miums policy and dispel some of the inaccurate information that has been deliberately circulated to confuse and scare elderly people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that this policy applies to around 118 preparations out of a pharmaceutical benefits system of 1,800. So it applies to about six per cent of medications. I am pleased to ensure honourable members that the process for the drug companies putting in prices has been exceedingly competitive and better than expected. Half of the drugs have come in at no premium whatsoever. The other half of medications have come in at a price whereby no single medication is over a $5 differential and only two medications are at a differential of $4. I would expect these products would be savaged in the marketplace in the near future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that across all products the average price differential is 63c&mdash;not $18, as was previously claimed by the shadow minister for health. The effect of this policy so far has been to take $467 million of identifiable savings. That will come off the profit of drug companies and return it to the taxpayers. Nearly half a billion dollars returned to the taxpayer: that is great news for taxpayers and great news for consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am further pleased to be able to inform the honourable member and the House that this morning I was phoned by the President of the Australian Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, Rod Unsworth, who told me that, after a telephone hook-up this morning, his association is prepared to support the policy and will back the government in implementing it for the benefit of consumers. So we now have all five peak bodies associated with pharmacy&mdash;the Pharmacy Guild, the Pharmaceutical Society of Australia, the Proprietary Medicines Association of Australia, the pharmacy distributors and the pharmacy manufacturers&mdash;backing this policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a lot of comment, which is unfortunate because it leads to concern in people's minds. We had the shadow minister earlier this year confusing sugar pills and cholesterol lowering drugs. I am pleased to inform him that the prices that have come in on cholesterol lowering drugs are all at the base price, so no-one on cholesterol lowering 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> drugs will have to change their medication or pay a cent more. The taxpayer is the one who benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shadow minister was also raising the possibility of what will happen to people in nursing homes in their confusion. Clearly he has not spent much time in nursing homes or he would know that all medication is given under supervision anyway by the nursing staff, so his issue is completely facetious.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third point the honourable shadow minister has been making, as he made in the House the other day, relates to the issue about certain chemical beta-blockers for treating high blood pressure being safer for people with cardiac failure. He asked whether it was correct that my expert advisory group had told me there was a problem here. I asked the expert advisory group, and the advice I got back yesterday&mdash;I will read it word for word as I wrote it down over the telephone&mdash;was, `The shadow minister's question doesn't make sense. We can't understand the logic behind his question,' and they went further to say, `He's probably confused the medications.' Again!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point of all this is that the pharmaceutical benefits system is an important scheme, as previous health ministers have conceded. Unless we have the costs under control, we will not be able to afford to keep it. It is at $2.76 billion this year. We will be spending about $300 million more this year, even after all the changes, than we would have otherwise spent. Today we have the final announcement of a 63c difference. That is incredibly to the benefit of the Australian taxpayers, the pharmaceutical system and the consumers.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> munity what many in the small business community described as the best news to come out of Canberra for small business in 20 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have seen these reports. I go back to August last year, when the Labor Party announced that their policy for the small business community was to have a review. Remember that one? They had 17 reviews in government and did nothing, and when they got into opposition their policy was to have a review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next thing was that in May this year they announced that they had seven principles&mdash;they were on one page, would you believe. The only other thing from the opposition about small business was from the member for Cunningham, who got up to reply to my statement on the government's policy for small business, and he had to say it was actually a pretty good statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say I was knocked over this morning when I saw a report under the heading `Labor woos small end of town with Bill changes'. What this report contains is a series of statements and descriptions about Labor's attitude to the small business community. The report this morning says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Labor plans to integrate small business concerns into other platform areas . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It also says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . integrated, one&hyphen;size&hyphen;fits&hyphen;all small business policy packages are not the way to win support from the sector . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Labor Party have announced that they have decided not to have a small business policy. They have decided to downgrade policy priority for the small business community. They have decided that there will not be an overarching policy commitment to the small business community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me take you to some of the propositions that they have announced this morning. They say it `will contain only a short statement of broad principles of small business policy'. The obvious explanation for that is that we are the small business party, we have announced the policy and you have decided that it is so hard, you are so far behind, that it is better to put up the white flag and not have 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10947"> a policy at all. The statement this morning says that Labor `will avoid getting into a small business policy war'. In other words, they will simply not even contest the basic policy issues relevant to the small business community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the question of industrial relations, this is a truly incredible statement for you to make. You say `it is nonsense to package industrial relations as a core area of concern for small business' because more than half of small businesses have no employees. They can have an industrial relations policy for the ACTU executive, but they cannot have an industrial relations policy for the two million employees who work in small business, of which there are 500,000. Do you know what their explanation is? They say, `Oh well, more than half of these small businesses don't employ anybody.' I ask people just to think about the consequences of that statement, because what they are saying is that for those 400,000 small businesses industrial relations is irrelevant.</PARA>

That is an interesting point and it does rather show the differences between the government and the Labor Party, because we not only have a policy for the small business community but also have a vision for the small business community, and part of that vision is that those 400,000 small businesses go out and give somebody a job. That is our vision for the small business community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Your vision for the small business community is to pretend that they do not exist, and you then say&mdash;or whatever you are going to not say in a sort of Clayton's statement on small business&mdash;that small business is exploited by big business and that, whatever you are going to say, it will cover finance, education and access to justice. But we have already brought down policy responses to those issues and the Labor Party have publicly acknowledged the worth of those changes.</PARA>

How do you respond to media reports which have suggested that this decision was an act of vindictive retribution after the resignation of three ministers and two members of staff over the travel allowance issue? Is it true that Mr Mellors first suggested late last year that the travel allowance system required fundamental review and yet this advice was not acted upon, despite your public speech last night acknowledging the need for responsive, relevant advice from the Public Service?

<ANSWER PAGE="10949" SPEAKER="Reith, Peter, MP" NAMEID="WI4" ELECTORATE="Flinders" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Workplace Relations and Small Business" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Dunkley for his question. It is true that there are some commentators and others who think job insecurity can justify substantial changes by way of further regulation of the Australian labour market, as if this were a cure for what they claim to be problems in the attitudes, to reflect the concerns of Australian workers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have done some work on exactly what attitudes there are in the Australian community about job insecurity. I must say, they are quite different from what you would be told if you listened to any member of the front bench of the Labor Party. In fact, you can only conclude that most of what they say when it comes to job insecurity is just a political stunt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at, for example, a survey by Clemengers&mdash;my shadow colleagues always refer to Clemengers&mdash;done in March this year, the question of job security did not even rate in the top 40 issues. We have some international evidence available to us from the OECD. The latest OECD employment outlook looked at job insecurity. They concluded that, in terms of job insecurity, Australia had the third lowest level. In fact, we were doing a lot better than just about anybody else you would care to mention&mdash;better than the UK, the US or even somewhere like Japan, which you would normally associate with job security, or 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10950"> Germany and France. We were only bettered by Austria and Norway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look from the international to the domestic evidence, AGB McNair did a survey on this in May and October of this year, with very interesting results. Only 14 per cent of respondents reported feeling insecure. But that was virtually unchanged when the same question was asked in May. In fact, they reported that 86 per cent of those surveyed felt secure, very secure or reasonably secure. They said that 29 per cent of workers felt more secure than they did a year ago and 52 per cent reported no change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lastly, we do have some interesting evidence on this from the Australian Workplace Industrial Relations Survey that looked at it. They came up with this conclusion: as between union members and non-union members, it was the union members who felt more insecure. What that means is that the Labor Party's policy on industrial relations, which is basically written by the ACTU executive, is to coerce people back into the union movement&mdash;everybody knows people have been leaving unions because they have not been providing a service&mdash;to force people back into the trade union movement, which would add to levels of insecurity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lastly, I want to make this point: to the extent that there is some insecurity&mdash;and I have reported that 14 per cent figure&mdash;it is a bit much that the Labor Party should be attempting to somehow place responsibility on the government in that respect. My authority for that is none other than the member for Melbourne, who had quite a lot to say about the previous government's economic policies and what it meant for security. This is what he said after they had just lost office about why they lost office in 1996:</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10951"> for the September quarter. For the first time in seven years it has shown a small increase.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We put this in the context of what has happened in the last seven years under Labor when we lost two per cent of the population per year out of private health insurance. We put it in the context that since the March 1990 quarter there has been a drop-out from private health insurance every single quarter. We put it in the context that 5,591,000 Australians now have private health insurance and 1,230,000 Australians have the benefits of government incentives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the end, I concede that that alone is not all our task is. There is certainly a substantial task still to do on informed financial consent. There is a substantial task of trying to make people fully aware of what they are going to be able to pocket, not having a large number of bills turning up after a procedure and not having large gaps. We are making progress on that as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The full picture will not emerge for some quarters because it will take time to get some idea of the full effect of the high income surcharge and the full effect of the drop-out rate or otherwise from the incentives. But the fact is that, on the basis of a two per cent drop-out each and every year under the Labor Party, this is a good first result. It is encouraging, it will take some pressure off the state public hospital system and it is something the previous government could never even have dreamt of achieving.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government proposes to amend the Trade Practices Act to set out a two&hyphen;tier test which a product will have to pass before it claims to be made in Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a question to ask of you, Mr Speaker. I wish to clarify procedure in the House. When people come into the observer boxes and they take their place, that is understood, but is it practice for people wanting to bring messages in to signal from outside the door and then have the attendants take the messages or do they come in and deliver the messages?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="10000">Mr SPEAKER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a combination of two factors. There is a method whereby a signal can be sent to an attendant. But senior ministerial advisers occupy the ministerial advisers boxes on both sides of the chamber for the opposition and the government. They are enabled frequently to move in and out of the chamber. But under no circumstances are any of the ministerial or opposition advisers enabled to approach any of their representatives in any way, other than through the ministerial media advisers boxes. They cannot under any circumstances approach the member personally.</PARA></TALK.START></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK></QTS>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 28 October the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Entsch) raised as a matter of privilege allegations of unauthorised disclosure in respect of the Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund. In accordance with the practice of the House in such matters, the honourable member was required to have the matter considered by his committee. The committee was required to take steps to try to ascertain the source of the disclosure and to consider whether substantial interference had occurred.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 18 November the honourable member for Leichhardt reported on the matter. In summary, first, he stated that his committee had considered the matter at a private meeting. Secondly, he identified five points concerning apparent disclosure of information. Thirdly, he stated that the committee considered that substantial interference had occurred. The honourable member for Leichhardt has also informed me that the committee 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10955"> has taken steps to try to ascertain the source of the disclosure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On Tuesday I allowed the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) to speak on the matter in circumstances not dissimilar to those in which I had allowed the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) to speak in October. The honourable member for Banks posed a number of questions. He queried a meeting said to have taken place on 27 October and raised detailed points about meetings of procedure and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have examined the honourable member for Banks' remarks and the papers he presented. But I consider that in such matters it is neither desirable nor practicable for a Speaker to try to make an assessment of the validity of any preliminary assessment reported to the House. The procedure adopted by Speaker McLeay followed by that of Speaker Martin was that, where a committee reported that substantial interference had occurred as a result of unauthorised disclosure and that steps had been taken to try to ascertain the source, precedence would be allowed to a motion. In accordance with this practice, I am willing to allow precedence to a motion on this matter.</PARA>

If somebody is going to be appointed to a job, we will do it; but we will not bother to go and investigate the circumstances of that appointment.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Earlier today I mentioned to the Minister for Sport and Tourism (Mr Andrew Thomson), who is at the table, that this is not a matter that is critical of him. He has been in the job for only a short period. But it is critical of the process. It is critical of the fact that comments have been made by the present minister in respect of what may happen or may not happen if Dr Arbeit has to be paid out, and that has implications for Athletics Australia and for sport in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> It is with some sadness that I report to this House today that, in endeavouring to get information on this matter from the government, the government used its numbers at a Senate committee meeting this afternoon to gag further questioning on the appointment of Dr Arbeit. Government members of the other place used their numbers to gag any debate and any questioning by Labor senators to ascertain some information on the process of the appointment of Dr Arbeit. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But some questions were asked earlier today, and they were quite revealing. In questions put to Mr John Boultbee, the Director of the Australian Institute of Sport, it came to light that the reason Athletics Australia was searching for a new head coach was that in about December 1996 or January 1997 the incumbent resigned. In March of 1997 the Athletics Australia organisation advertised for a replacement, seeking to have applications closed in April, some few weeks later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It came to pass that, when the due date arose, 18 applications or thereabouts were received. Guess whose application was not 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10959"> there? Dr Arbeit's application came three months later, in August. Dr Arbeit's application came after&mdash;according to Mr Boultbee&mdash;an applicant from Britain said he really didn't want the job but he reckoned there was this former East German who would fit the bill. He said to Athletics Australia: `You should get in touch with him.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John Boultbee happened to be overseas at the time and Athletics Australia said to John Boultbee: `Could you go and have a chat with this Dr Arbeit character that we have heard about? He might be the bloke for the job in Australia.' So Mr Boultbee did; he went and had a chat with him. But Mr Boultbee, when questioned about the nature of that discussion, said that it was a `cursory' examination only, it was something which he undertook on behalf of Athletics Australia but it really wasn't an in&hyphen;depth, fact finding mission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is quite significant, because one of the criticisms that has been levelled at Athletics Australia in regard to the appointment of Dr Arbeit has been the process by which this particular individual was chosen and whether that process threw up the information about him. I know that the Minister for Sport and Tourism, who is at the table, has been concerned about that and has expressed those concerns. I know that his predecessor ultimately came to the view that that process perhaps was not right. That is why a three&hyphen;person committee of very influential and very significant former athletes has been put together to investigate that process. But the simple fact is that Mr Boultbee, who formed this rudimentary opinion, as he told the Senate estimates committee this afternoon only, subsequently saw an application for the job come forward by Dr Arbeit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday, the minister told a press conference that there had been no contract signed between Athletics Australia and Dr Arbeit. The minister said that there had only been a letter of offer exchanged between the two parties. In that respect the minister is suggesting, therefore, that there is no compulsion on behalf of Athletics Australia to pay out any of the moneys&mdash;$400,000, I think, was the actual amount being offered to Dr Arbeit to come 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> here&mdash;or any compensation because there is not a firm contract.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, Dr Arbeit thinks there is. Doctor A reckons he has a contract. He reckons that he could have gone to South Korea&mdash;I think it was South Korea&mdash;to coach. But unfortunately he can't go to too many other places. On the wires today there is a comment from Professor Werner Franke, who is the independent scientist who has been doing the inquiries into the drugs in sport programs in the former East Germany and who says about our good friend Dr Arbeit that he was not `a pill distributor but a decision maker' and:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It's clear that he was a top gun at decision making level. He uses the word anabolic steroids and says this person takes too much, this person needs more. Who is more involved? The person who gives the order to shoot at the border or the person who shoots?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is the point. Athletics Australia has been saying all along, and Martin Soust said yesterday on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS>  program:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We've always said that if there was any hard evidence that would link Dr Arbeit with the administration of drugs to athletes, he was personally involved in the administration of those drugs to athletes, then of course we would consider our appointment of him to positions for coaching.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is the point. Mr Soust, who is the executive director of Athletics Australia and still championing Dr Arbeit as the person to get the job, said that if there were any hard evidence they would not give him the job. Today we have reporting back from Germany the chief scientist, the investigator doing the inquiry, saying: `He was a decision maker. He knew about all this.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But wait. There is more. As we know, not only is this particular individual involved in doping and looking after athletes under his care in terms of their drug program but, in the true tradition of 007 James Bond, he is a spy, or was a spy. There have been revelations that he worked for Stasi, the East German secret police, and reported on the athletes in his care and control, reported on their sexual habits and sexual preferences, on what they had for breakfast, on whether they were taking enhancing drugs or not in their performance and, if they were, on whether they should go to Western countries to perform in case there 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10960"> were drug testing procedures that might find them out. This is a man who was being sought by Australia to look after our efforts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, I said this the other day. I wonder now whether, in looking for an out, Athletics Australia might go back to the application form. Have a look on that and see, okay, `Dr Ekkart Arbeit'. Where did he come from? `Former East Germany'. Look under `Previous occupations' and see whether `spy' has been listed: `Previous occupation&mdash;spy.' If it is there then you could probably say: `Okay. He has told us all about his previous occupation.' But if it is not there, clearly that might be an out for Athletics Australia. Then go and have a look at the list of referees that he has probably advanced as well. You would probably find John Le Carre, Sean Connery, Sir Anthony Blunt, Maxwell Smart, Peter Wright and, at the end, Inspector Gadget. All of those would have been good referees for this bloke, who is supposed to come in and look after Australia's elite athletes as they prepare themselves for the next Commonwealth Games and Olympic Games.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, you were dead right yesterday, and I commend you for saying it, that this man should be cut loose now. However, not only are you saying it. Editorial after editorial, either today or in recent times, has called for the same action to be taken: the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, `Arbeit choice discredited by Stasi files'; the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, `Sack Dr Arbeit'; the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph</EMPHASIS> in Sydney, `A bad sport'; the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald&hyphen;Sun</EMPHASIS> in Melbourne, `Stay home, Dr Arbeit'; in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS>, `No place here for Stasi informer'; and, finally, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> in Melbourne, `A coach we won't abide'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The simple fact is that not only are people who are opinion makers saying this but so too are people who should know&mdash;the people in the sports themselves. Have a look at the list of people, starting from administrators in the Australian Olympic movement, and in the international Olympic movement. Have a look at people like Raelene Boyle, Melinda Gainsford-Taylor, any of those athletes, and see what they have said in the past and what they are saying now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I saw Melinda Gainsford-Taylor on TV last night, She is one of Australia's real hopes to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> win gold in athletics next year at the Kuala Lumpur Commonwealth Games. She said that the non-appointment of a head coach is affecting the ability of her own coach to get appointment and her preparation. Raelene Boyle has been out there in the media also saying that these people who in the past administered drugs to the East German athletes cost her gold medals in Olympic Games&mdash;and that is right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet Athletics Australia is standing firm and saying, `Well, show us some hard evidence that this bloke being a spy for the former East German secret police is going to be a worry for Australian athletes.' You ask any of the present athletes, `Excuse me, would you mind if we were to employ this guy and, look, his track record is that he used to spy on people's sexual preferences; have you got any worries about that?' and see what those athletes today say. If it was not so stupid, it would make you laugh.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the other interesting problem that the minister has now identified for Athletics Australia goes to the funding issue. The minister has said&mdash;in fact, he has given a categorical ruling on this&mdash;no public funds will be used to pay out Dr Arbeit if in fact that has to happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, I refer you to the annual report of the Australian Sports Commission of 1996-97. That annual report lists how much money is allocated by the Sports Commission to each sport that they look after in this country. Near the top of the tree, one of the super seven sports is athletics&mdash;and it is on page 77. How much went to Athletics Australia? It was $3.1 million approximately.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have said that no taxpayer funds will be used to pay out Arbeit, but the major source of funds for Athletics Australia is taxpayer funds. They come from your Australian Sports Commission. I think, therefore, that will be a matter you will have to pursue. I agree that they get funding from other sources, external sources, but is that funding anywhere near the $400,000 it may be necessary to give the good Dr A his marching orders? I am concerned that, if Athletics Australia has to find $400,000 to pay this joker out, it will mean that there will be less 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10961"> money for athletes in this country, less money as they prepare themselves to go to Kuala Lumpur next year, less money as they prepare themselves for the 2000 Olympics in Sydney and less money overall for the development of Australia's elite talent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You know as well as I do&mdash;because you have been singing the same tune as I have for years&mdash;that Australia is a proud drug&hyphen;free country. Yet Athletics Australia, by taking the absolutely stupid and naive decision it took months ago to appoint Dr Arbeit to this position, has thumbed its nose at what Australia has stood for. Can you imagine us in Kuala Lumpur next year and in Sydney 2000 going to the games and saying, `Look, we want stronger drug testing, we've put more money into drug testing, we've done more tests this year than we have ever done; but oh, by the way, we have a former East German spy who is a drug pusher as the head of our athletics coaches.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What an absolute nonsense that is. It is an absolute joke. As the editorialists of major dailies in this country wrote today, `It's time that Dr A be given the big A.' Minister, you have to ensure that that happens. Your words give me comfort in this, I have to say, and I commend you for it. You have been saying, although a little bit at arm's length, it is a decision for Athletics Australia. But, let me tell you, according to the ASC, you give them the bulk of their money. Use that as a leverage to say to Athletics Australia, `Boys and girls, cut your losses, stop making yourselves look like a bunch of geese, and get rid of Dr A.' It is time he went. It is time that we got somebody who Australians can work with. What is wrong with Australian coaches? We have to go around the world finding ex&hyphen;spies and putting them in. There must be somebody in this country who can do the job. Minister, I implore you to use your good offices to ensure that Athletics Australia does the right thing. The matter is not going to stop here. We will continue to ask questions about this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to know what your predecessor knew about this appointment: was he informed by the Australian Sports Commission about any of this? I would have thought that, in the broader scheme of things, he 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> would have been given advice. Did he sign off on it? I wonder if you might be able to respond to that particular question. Did Minister Smith know about that? Dr A should go now. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This MPI is the first that has been called on since I assumed this job and, I must say, it has surprised me a little. As far as the government is concerned, and the taxpayers are concerned, the affair of Dr Ekkart Arbeit finished yesterday when we made it very clear that, in order to protect the country's reputation in the matter of sport and drug&hyphen;free sport and the perception that is necessary therein, especially for a country that is hosting an Olympic Games, no taxpayers money would go to fund any payout of this man were his proposed appointment to be rejected, as we all hope it will be. And, in the extraordinary case were Athletics Australia to persevere and employ him, likewise I would take the necessary steps to make sure that no taxpayers' funds would be used in his employment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, that said, what I find somewhat disturbing perhaps are not only the allegations in the newspapers but also the fact that one of the opposition frontbenchers is here in the parliament commending me. It reminds me of that old phrase of Chairman Mao: when the fox seems friendly, put another lock on the chicken coop. It is not often that the two sides in the federal parliament agree on things. But there are some things, plainly, on which we do in this case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All that said, what is important, I think, is that due process and priorities be observed in these contentious matters&mdash;although, as I said yesterday, the issues raised to date are very disturbing. We have these sorts of allegations of apparent, although unsubstantiated, facts being reported in our news media. They are coming out of these files that have been released from the former Republic of East Germany's internal secret service&mdash;the Stasi, as it is known. Things that go to the alleged activities of Dr Arbeit while he was acting as a senior coach in East Germany make it quite 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10962"> clear to me that his appointment, should it go ahead, would be quite contrary to the government's determination to keep Australia's reputation in this matter as pure and wholesome as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is clear, likewise, that Athletics Australia, as my opponent the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) said, is the custodian, primarily, of our good name and he alluded to the preposterous notion that an Australian athletics team could go next year to the Commonwealth Games, let alone to the Sydney Olympics, with a man with the apparent history of Dr Arbeit as their head coach and that this would go directly to our international reputation and is not something that the government, the taxpayers or the athletes of Australia would ever tolerate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should make it clear that this is not an appointment proposed by government; it is an appointment proposed by a national sporting organisation. As tempting as it is in some of these cases to rush in and purport to exercise powers that one does not actually legally possess, in this case I did my best yesterday to make it clear that the appointment would be unacceptable to the government. As the honourable member for Cunningham points out, the federal government is the majority sponsor or funder of Athletics Australia&mdash;through the grant Athletics Australia receives through the Sports Commission&mdash;and therefore the sort of person appointed to coach our very precious athletes is of direct national interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the question of compensation, the legalities and these sorts of things, as I said yesterday, there is no formal contract between Dr Arbeit and Athletics Australia and therefore no question of termination ought to arise. If they choose not to proceed with the appointment, as I am fairly confident they will choose, and if in the extraordinary case litigation was on foot here in Australia, I am advised likewise that the termination clause of this letter of offer provided to Dr Arbeit specifies a period of only one month. In that unlikely case this would result in an amount being paid of about $8,000, not $400,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wonder whether the honourable member for Cunningham has suspected this from the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> beginning but has been led astray perhaps by people who persuaded him to quote a higher figure in order to generate a few headlines.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If there is no contract&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">on foot&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">why does the Australian taxpayer have to pay for a review whose findings are unlikely to result in the appointment of Dr Arbeit?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is not so. We will not pay for a review. I think you  know, having served as Speaker, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10963"> that when these grants are made and they are acquitted by invoice, as it were, or receipt for money spent, one has the opportunity to say, `No, that acquittal is not within the guidelines for which you were given the money and therefore you will not receive any compensation for incurring that expense.' But it would be, frankly, laughable if they came to the taxpayer for some sort of underwriting commitment for the expense of a review.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FB6">Mr ANDREW THOMSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wonder. But, that said, the taxpayers will not be asked, let alone burdened, with the cost of this review. The second question that the honourable gentleman raises is:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What is the process for appointing coaches to Australia, that is, how did we end up in this mess in the first place?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That really is covered in the terms of reference under which this review was established. The first of them is that the review will `consider the steps already taken and information gained in the selection process'. The second is that they will `determine what, if any, additional lines of inquiry can be followed about Dr Arbeit'. The third one is that they will `ensure that those lines are followed thoroughly'. And, as I said yesterday, the fourth element of that was the taking into account of any `substantiated evidence about Dr Arbeit coming to light' and recommending to Athletics Australia whether or not he would be an appropriate person to fulfil the position of the director of coaching. So, in my mind, those terms of reference go to that second question: that the process of appointment in this case would be examined by the review. I look forward to reading very carefully the conclusions of this review.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="MARTIN" NAMEID="8I4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8I4">Mr Martin</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is that going to be made public?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FB6">Mr ANDREW THOMSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is an interesting question whether or not the written 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> conclusions of the review are to be made public. It is something for Athletics Australia to decide in the first instance. Plainly, given that the government and hence the parliament have through the budget process given their imprimatur to funds flowing to Athletics Australia, I think it is proper that such conclusions are made public. I was asked a similar question last night on the ABC when the interviewer asked whether I expected that there would be some explanation of what happened, and I said that yes, I thought we would be given that explanation shortly. That, I imagine, will be the release of the conclusions of this review.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, the third question of the press release was this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Will the Minister now make taxpayer funding of Athletics Australia contingent upon a comprehensive and transparent process for appointments?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That goes without saying. There has been difficulty with a particular national sporting organisation&mdash;there have been plenty in the past, I gather&mdash;where grants have been given and the budget either has been misspent or has blown out and so forth, and the purpose for which the grant was made is not achieved. Of course, the next time they come back to the Sports Commission for funding for another year, ipso facto the board would say, without any written instruction from the minister, `Well, last year wasn't too terrific, lads. How are we going to do it this year?' It is pretty obvious that this is going to be the case here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lastly, let me say a few things about my feeling about the role of sports minister and sport generally and the position of the government in relation to it. I have always been wary of excessive government interference in the lives of citizens. There were some things in my professional life before I was elected to parliament that so irritated me that I put aside what I thought was a terrific job and sought election to this place. So I have always had a philosophical position that the presumption should be in favour of citizens managing their affairs without the ex cathedra intervention of a minister, especially in a federal government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of sport it is very difficult. There have been some issues raised by senior 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10964"> figures in sport, Herb Elliott for one. I heard him on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Grandstand</EMPHASIS> program on ABC Radio last Saturday or two Saturdays ago talking about the pressure for medals&mdash;this issue of how much should the nation expect of our athletes and to what extent must they go to win gold with the pressure that is on them. Sometimes this is given as a reason or even, sadly, an excuse for people who resort to drugs in sport. That is something that we can all dismiss very quickly. Plainly, people who take drugs to enhance their sporting performance are cheating. It is as simple as that. It is just not fair to the others in the sport and therefore, if I may use the phrase, it is quite un&hyphen;Australian.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sport, especially for young Australians&mdash;it certainly was for me as a young fellow&mdash;is something to look up to and something you look to for an example of good behaviour. The qualities of persistence, grace in defeat and modesty or magnanimity in victory and what we would call fairness or good sportsmanship are qualities that are important to preserve. Therefore, there is the question of using the great mechanics of federal government, agencies such as the Sports Drug Agency and the powers you grant to them under legislation, to take tests, and even what we have to do to make sure in future that our Sports Drug Agency is legally empowered to do certain things that will allow it to detect new forms of cheating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Blood tests are given as one example of what might be necessary in the future. That is a very touchy thing, and in a way it is very upsetting to think that in the future, to keep sport free of drugs and fair to all, you would have to take a sample of someone's blood. It seems a very repellent notion. But, sadly, there are methods and I suppose there are substances that are not detected in the other bodily fluids which are the medium for detecting people who cheat with drugs but are really perhaps only detectable in someone's blood. Well, if it takes that much, with the agreement of people who participate in the sports, with the consensus necessary for such a serious step to be taken, we may have to amend the powers of the Sports Drug Agency to take such steps as that.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose we will look back on this case of Dr Arbeit in a few years and have a good chuckle. Serious matter though it is, it has really reached a level of farce that I think none of us quite expected when it first reared its head. If people in positions of authority in national sporting organisations think that it is a reasonable thing to ignore these basic proprieties, I ask them to reflect very seriously on that. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

Within my electorate the Australian Institute of Sport is located, and many past and hopefully future Olympians and other sportspeople find themselves there from time to time.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Sport and Tourism yesterday refused to intervene to stop Athletics Australia appointing its proposed appointee, Dr Arbeit. That is despite the defiant position taken by Athletics Australia. The minister made overtures to Athletics Australia that it perhaps should not proceed with that appointment. He spoke about that yesterday, and his sentiments were commended by the shadow minister. But the fact remains that it changed nothing. Athletics Australia is proposing to proceed with its investigation. It is vacillating over this issue, and this issue needs to be resolved by the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Executive Director of Athletics Australia, Martin Soust, said that Dr Arbeit's spy links were not relevant to their investigation of the appointment. He insisted that only hard evidence of Dr Arbeit's involvement in administering drugs would force them to withdraw their appointment. I think such an arrogant position taken by Athletics Australia requires the minister to intervene, because it affects the high standing of Australia as a

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is written evidence that there was a doping program in the GDR at the time that Dr Arbeit was the director of sport in that country, yet the minister still refuses to intervene. He claimed in his recent address to the House that he did not have the power to do so. In my view, he clearly does. He has a lot of leverage, as the shadow minister has pointed out to him. If he finds himself without the power, he can come into this place and ask for it. Instead, he has asked them to continue with their investigations. Athletics Australia are defying the minister, and yet the minister continues to vacillate over the issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At best, Dr Arbeit knew about doping and there is scant evidence that he combated it in the GDR. At worst, he actively promoted drug use to gain unfair advantage over Australian athletes and athletes from other countries. Quite frankly, the innocence of Dr Arbeit or otherwise is essentially irrelevant. This is not a debate about natural justice being afforded to Dr Arbeit. His contract has not been signed, according to the minister. We do not owe him natural justice in the normal course of events that you might owe to a party to which you have contracted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whatever the level of Dr Arbeit's involvement in performance enhancing drugs, the international perception will be that Australia is soft on drugs in sport if the appointment proceeds. That is the concern. That is very clear; it is very clear even to this minister. This is about the reputation of our athletes, a reputation which will be sullied if this minister continues to be weak on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia will be hosting the Olympics in the year 2000. The eyes of the world will be upon us and our attitude to drugs in sport. Yet we may be hosting the Olympics with a head coach who has a past in the perception of the world firmly and squarely footed in an active support for performance enhancing drugs in sport. As Melinda Gainsford-Taylor, the world indoor 200-metre champion, said last month:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I totally detest drug cheats. I am clean and proud of it. I have worked far too hard for the public to now speculate that I take drugs. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is a concern shared by many athletes. It was described by Lee Naylor, the 400-metre world championship bronze medallist, who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If he does come out here, I'm sure that athletes and coaches alike will try and distance themselves from him.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And why would they not? The battle against drugs in sport is only a matter of science. For every new test that we develop to catch new performance enhancing drugs, new drugs are developed to evade those tests. It is a never ending cycle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There remains, despite the advances in drug testing, doubts about the effectiveness of that testing. So the perceptions about the seriousness of host nations and nations involved in sport are quite critical. It is all very well to pick up medals at the Olympic Games and other sporting events, but if the perception is that you have cheated the value of that victory is enormously devalued. Dr Arbeit presided over an organisation that had a doping program. Athletics Australia have described him as the medal messiah. We are left with a perception that the drive for gold has blinded their commitment to play by the rules.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Athletes are now increasing their training effort for the 2000 Olympics. The concern is that our efforts at the Olympics will be tarnished by this rather sordid debate. So huge has been the concern that many athletes have spoken out. We have heard from Raylene Boyle, Jane Flemming, Darren Clarke, Nicole Boegman, Kieren Perkins, Lee Naylor, Steve Moneghetti, Melinda Gainsford-Taylor, Kyle Vander-Kuyp and Tim Forsyth. They have all spoken out. They are all proud athletes and athletes of which this country should be proud. They are asking that we reciprocate some of the effort that they have put in on this country's behalf. IOC member Phil Coles summarised the situation when he said last month:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If that's the way the athletes feel there is nowhere for him to go, even if he is cleared, because he doesn't have their support.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Frankly, by refusing to take action, the minister compromises not only the reputation 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10966"> of our athletes as drug&hyphen;free athletes but also their chances of winning at the Olympics and every other sporting event.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the athletes under the chief coach&mdash;the boss of the show&mdash;cannot work with him, it defies imagination how our chances at the Olympics will be improved. In my view, the minister has little regard for the efforts of these athletes, because their reputations are being sullied by the ongoing drama surrounding the appointment of this gentleman.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are people who have trained endlessly for years; they have made huge sacrifices for their sport in order to represent this country. They have set back their non-sporting careers. They have suffered all the things that people have to compromise when they spend inordinate hours in one obsessive pursuit. And their country wants to appoint a boss who spies on the most intimate personal details of athletes' lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a bloke who, figuratively speaking, hovers at the keyhole, filling out reports on people's personal lives, on their sexual preferences and files them with political masters. Is this the sort of person we want representing our sporting heroes and champions? Is this the sort of person that our sporting heroes and champions should have to work under? How many workers in this country would cop a boss carrying on like that? Is that the Australian way? Perhaps it will be in the future under this coalition's approach to industrial relations, but I do not think our sporting champions should have to cop that kind of behaviour. I think the coalition, in refusing to intervene aggressively in this matter, is creating an image that perhaps they are quite relaxed about that sort of behaviour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite frankly, it comes down to a decision of providing natural justice to a former Stasi spy on the one hand or backing our athletes on the other. But this is not a debate about natural justice, as I have said. If it comes down to backing the athletes on the one hand or spies on the other, I and all my Labor colleagues will back the athletes any day of the week. It is about time the minister came in here, intervened and stopped Athletics Australia's carry&hyphen;on.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is unfortunate that the first two speakers were followed by that last speech by the member for Fraser (Mr Dargavel). I am afraid he has shown his political immaturity and, regrettably, his age and maturity. To address this debate in the manner that the member for Fraser did in the last two minutes of his speech does him no good at all. I would be very surprised if his colleagues agreed with the sentiments he expressed in the last two minutes of his speech.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first speaker, the shadow minister, quite rightly indicated to the House that the Minister for Sport and Tourism (Mr Andrew Thomson) had done what was required of him. I am pleased that he has adopted that attitude in the last three or four hours. I think he would admit, if questioned about it, that that certainly has not been his view in press releases over the last 24 hours, wherein he used expressions such as `biting the bullet' and `clearing up the mess' and called on the sports minister to intervene immediately and stop the appointment. The shadow minister&mdash;I will give him his dues&mdash;has had a chance to think about that. His speech today indicated that he is acutely aware of the fact that this minister cannot sack Dr Arbeit. Indeed, the shadow minister acknowledged that he can make moves which are supported by the minister to ensure it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have thought that it was very clearly indicated that this man will not be paid by the taxpayers if he is sacked, under whatever contractual regime it might be, and that he will not be paid from taxpayers' funds if he is employed. It is a very clear lean&hyphen;on. If indeed the member for Fraser, who has left the chamber, is telling the House that government ministers should, at whatever stage of a debate, take on matters such as this and pre-empt the role of appointed sporting bodies in this country, then I think that that would be a very dangerous precedent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The House should be aware that there are three coaches from the former GDR who are employed by the Australian Institute of Sport. If the implication is that this man's back 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="10967"> ground automatically makes him guilty of a series of offences, which the honourable member for Fraser tried to imply today, then I think that is a very dangerous precedent for the honourable member to pursue. I would be very surprised if those sentiments were shared by his colleagues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the great bulk of honourable members in this House would believe that due process should be followed. It really is a very basic and fundamental right of the community and something that this parliament should support. Due process has been followed. The shadow minister quite rightly acknowledged how quickly this new minister became involved. The announcement from AA was made on 2 October; on 3 October there was some criticism from Australian athletes; there was criticism at an annual meeting of Australian track and field coaches; there was a crisis meeting of AA, with a vote to stand by Dr Arbeit; and on 8 October the federal minister ordered a review of the decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will read out the terms of that review because it is very important for it to be put on the public record just how far this review went into it. A decision can then be made about the appropriateness or otherwise of that review. The document states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The review will:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">&hyphen;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Taking account of any unsubstantiated evidence about Dr Arbeit coming to light, recommend whether he would be an appropriate person to fulfil the position of Director of Coaching.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">If there is one thing that is pivotal to sport in this country&mdash;I would be very surprised if the shadow minister does not agree with me&mdash;it is that Australian sport should be run by Australian sport. I suspect that if there is one group in this country that would suffer the most from inappropriate government intervention it probably would be the elite athletes of this country.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I need to differentiate between the comments made in the last hour by the shadow minister, who acknowledges that the role played by the minister has been an appropriate one, and the immature comments of the member for Fraser, who I hope will go back and have a look at his speech and at the shadow minister's comments and then decide whether guilt by geographic association, which he effectively alleged, was an appropriate course to undertake. I do not think that on reflection he will believe that it is appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shadow minister has taken a bipartisan approach on this matter. I do not think he would want any minister for sport to rush in where fools fear to tread, and it would be totally inappropriate. History will show that this new minister has very much bitten the bullet and has done everything that is required of him. The shadow minister knows&mdash;the member for Fraser should know; if he does not, he ought to be very careful about what he says in this place&mdash;that the Australian Minister for Sport and Tourism cannot remove Dr Arbeit from his position. If you accept that as fact, which it is, you then review what this minister has done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am a little annoyed that the tag team from the opposition today has been led by the shadow minister; he has taken the responsible position. But one of his backbenchers has been running with the principle that where there is smoke, there is a bit of fire. I do not think that is appropriate in the circumstances. People need to make a decision about whether they believe a minister for sport saying that no taxpayer funds will be used to buy this man out if that is required&mdash;I think the minister quoted a figure of $8,000 in a worst case scenario. If those in the House and those listening to this debate reflect on the minister's comments, they will know that the minister quite specifically alluded to a termination agreement, in writing, of four weeks. It is not $400,000; the maximum is $8,000. The minister has quite clearly said in this House and on the public record that it will not be paid for by the taxpayer. I repeat: he has quite clearly said that, if Athletics Australia employs this man, the Australian taxpayer will not be funding it. If it looks like a

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This minister&mdash;and this has been acknowledged by the shadow minister&mdash;cannot force Athletics Australia to sack this man. He has no power at all to do anything in a contractual sense.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This bill will amend the Judiciary Act 1903 to establish the Australian Government Solicitor, AGS, as a statutory authority separate from my department, so as to enhance its position as the government's legal firm in providing quality legal services to the Commonwealth and Commonwealth bodies. It will also provide a framework for greater contestability in the delivery of legal services to the Commonwealth, in particular to enable private law firms to compete for the first time for significant areas of Commonwealth litigation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition's law and justice policy for the last election included a commitment to undertake a review of legal services provided by the Attorney&hyphen;General's Legal Practice, including an examination of the possibilities for government departments and agencies to use private legal firms for litigation. To fulfil that commitment, in November 1996 I commissioned a review of the Commonwealth's legal services needs and how those needs could best be met.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The review committee, which comprised an experienced businessman, a prominent barrister and the then secretary to my department, undertook an extensive review of these issues. The committee consulted with departments and agencies about their legal services needs, as well as holding discussions with the Legal Practice, departmental legal units and private sector lawyers about the delivery of legal services to government. It also commissioned 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10969"> a survey of the Legal Practice's clients and a detailed business analysis of the Legal Practice and invited public submissions on the issues being examined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee's report&mdash;the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report of the Review of the Attorney-General`s Legal Practice</EMPHASIS>&mdash;was delivered in March 1997 and made 16 recommendations for reform of the Legal Practice. The committee found that the Legal Practice had made considerable improvements over recent years in its efficiency and the quality of its services&mdash;reflected in the generally positive responses to the client survey. However, significant further improvement was possible and desirable, particularly if the government solicitor was to continue to provide high quality, cost-effective legal services in an increasingly competitive environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the fundamental questions examined by the committee was whether the retention of a government owned Legal Practice was justified. The committee found that maintaining government ownership of the Legal Practice was in the public interest. The reasons for this included the ability of the Legal Practice to meet the legal services needs of the Commonwealth&mdash;which could be put at risk if the Legal Practice were sold&mdash;its abilities to meet the legal services needs of departments and agencies because of its particular focus on government work, its ability to maintain a `whole of government' approach, its strong corporate memory and the need for a government legal service provider to meet the unique role and needs of the Attorney-General in providing legal services which are core to government. Accordingly, the report recommended retention of the Legal Practice as a government authority, albeit with greater contestability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government considered all options, including the possible sale of the commercial parts of the Legal Practice, but has firmly concluded, for the reasons outlined by the committee, that they should be retained within government ownership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the government also considers that, without further reform, the AGS will face a serious risk of not being competitive in the marketplace. This is principally because 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of the current limits on the AGS's business structure and operations, by virtue of its status as part of the Attorney-General's Department. These limitations are not shared by the private law firms with which the AGS is increasingly being asked to compete.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Establishment of the Australian Government Solicitor</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has, therefore, accepted the thrust of the committee's recommendations, and in particular has decided to restructure the AGS as a new legal services provider. The bill will implement this decision by amending the Judiciary Act 1903 to establish the AGS as a new statutory body.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The AGS will be structured in a way that maximises its ability to provide legal services and conduct its business operations on a commercial, competitive basis. Its separation from the Attorney-General's Department will facilitate its operation as a government business enterprise. Consistent with the usual approach for government business enterprises&mdash;and the position enjoyed by private law firms&mdash;it will also be able to employ staff and consultants outside the usual public service regime. Further, it will be able to charge fees at market rates in relation to the legal services it provides.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The AGS will not be established under the corporations law but will be set up as a government owned statutory authority, headed by a CEO rather than a board of directors. The CEO will be responsible for the management of the AGS and will otherwise have responsibilities similar to the boards of other government business enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The AGS will be able to provide legal and related services to a range of government departments, agencies and officers, including to state and territory bodies if they request it to do so. Constitutional limits mean that, unlike private law firms, the AGS's potential client base is largely limited to the Commonwealth government and its agencies and a small range of persons who are acting for the Commonwealth. The bill makes it clear that the AGS will be able to provide advice to the full range of clients within the constitutional limits. This more focused client base will enable the AGS to deliver a unified, special 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="10970"> ised and nationally coordinated approach to government legal services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The AGS is not, and cannot be, the same as privately owned law firms. Its unique value to government is based on its government ownership and its expertise in delivering legal services to government clients. In line with this role, some limited core areas of government legal work, primarily cabinet, constitutional and national security matters, will be reserved to the AGS and not be available to private law firms. The public interest served by having the AGS undertake this role is not inconsistent with having the AGS operate at the highest level of efficiency and make a profit as a government business enterprise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a government business enterprise, the AGS will have, in effect, me, as Attorney-General, and the Minister for Finance and Administration as `joint shareholders'. Consistent with this approach, the bill gives joint responsibility to the Attorney&hyphen;General and Minister for Finance and Administration for the business operations of the AGS. This will not interfere with the legal professional functions of the AGS nor with the Attorney-General's responsibilities as first law officer in relation to these functions.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Competitive neutrality</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is committed to ensuring that, as far as possible, government owned businesses are placed in the same position as the privately owned businesses with which they compete. In most areas of work, departments and agencies will be able to use private law firms to carry out their legal work. In particular, litigation other than that in the reserved categories will be contestable. This opening up of most categories of litigation completes the process of providing choice to government clients that was commenced in 1995. Prior to the proposed commencement on 1 July 1998 of the new system, approval for untying of litigation will be possible on an ad hoc administrative basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill contains several measures to ensure that, consistent with the government's competitive neutrality policy statement, the AGS will not enjoy any competitive advantage over private law firms by virtue of its government ownership. Thus, the bill will establish a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> mechanism to require the AGS to pay to the Commonwealth, in respect of each financial year, an amount equivalent to the total amount of any taxation liability that would have been incurred by it under Commonwealth, state and territory laws if it were a firm of legal practitioners. While the AGS will not be subject to state and territory taxation laws unless they are specially prescribed, requiring the AGS to make a tax equivalent payment will ensure that it enjoys no net competitive taxation advantage over private law firms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, I will be empowered, together with the Minister for Finance and Administration and after consultation with the CEO of the AGS, to determine corporate governance arrangements for the AGS. The corporate governance arrangements will enable the AGS to be required to make other payments where this is necessary to achieve competitive neutrality in respect of costs incurred by private law firms. As with other government business enterprises, the AGS will be required to pay to the Commonwealth a dividend analogous to the return of profits to the partners in a law firm.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most importantly, the power to determine corporate governance arrangements will enable the arrangements that apply to the AGS to take into account the particular structure of the AGS and its function of providing legal services to government. In addition, the AGS will be subject to the reporting, accountability and financial requirements of the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Legal services directions</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also gives the Attorney-General power to issue legal services directions relating to Commonwealth legal work. These directions will be capable of applying to departments and agencies in receipt of legal services and to their legal services providers, including the AGS, private legal firms and `in-house' legal units.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The directions will provide a framework for the conduct of the Commonwealth's legal affairs but will leave prime responsibility for the effective and efficient use of legal services with departments and agencies. Directions 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10971"> will be able to be made on the full range of issues affecting Commonwealth legal work, including what work is to be contestable, reporting arrangements in relation to legal work and compliance by legal service providers with the obligation of the Commonwealth to act as a model litigant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This power to issue directions will ensure that, as Attorney-General, I will be in a position to manage risks that could arise from the provision of legal services that are inconsistent, that lack coordination or that do not identify and appropriately deal with whole of government and public interest issues. This is necessary in an environment where an increased range of government legal work will be contestable by private sector firms which are providing a significant proportion of overall legal services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I am determined to ensure that minimum restrictions are imposed on the way legal services are provided to departments and agencies, consistent with the aim of ensuring that departments and agencies should be fully and directly accountable for their decisions in relation to legal services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In line with the recommendations of the report on the legal practice, the government approved the establishment within my department of the Office of Legal Services Coordination to assist me in discharging my first law officer role, especially in relation to litigation. The office is now operational and will assist me in the preparation of legal services directions and in consulting with departments and agencies, as well as the private profession, about their content. It will also advise on Commonwealth litigation policy, both in general and in relation to particular cases. In this regard, it will have an important role to play in advising departments and agencies on their obligations under the legal services directions, and on the purchase and delivery of legal services, so as to achieve maximum efficiency and appropriate risk management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The power to issue directions is designed to enable the Attorney-General of the day to fulfil his or her first law officer functions in relation to the provision of legal services to the Commonwealth. Compliance with directions will therefore not be enforceable other 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> than by the Attorney-General, and only the Commonwealth will be able to raise the issue of non-compliance with directions in any legal proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reforms introduced by the bill will give the AGS the structure and flexibility in its business activities and legal services work to enable it to continue to provide high quality legal services to government in an increasingly competitive market. While public interest considerations require that a small number of core subject matters be tied exclusively to government legal providers, for most matters departments and agencies will be able to choose where they obtain their legal services. The bill's reforms will ensure that the AGS is well placed to compete for this work. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill.</PARA>

In this way the act can be used to control the Australian market for imported copies of recordings. This is significant as imported 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10972"> recordings constitute the overwhelming percentage of recordings marketed in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will exempt the importation of non-pirate copies of a sound recording from infringement of copyright in either the sound recording or the works recorded on the recording. It will thereby remove the ability of copyright owners to control the market for each imported copy of a sound recording.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Concerns have long been held that the importation provisions of the Copyright Act have been used to obtain higher prices for records and CDs than those prevailing in some other countries, notably the United States of America. The concerns were raised in an inquiry by the copyright law review committee, on which it reported in 1988. This was followed by an inquiry into the prices of sound recordings by the then Prices Surveillance Authority, PSA, in 1990. The PSA found that prices of sound recordings were unreasonably high in Australia and recommended either partial or full removal of copyright control over importation of legitimate copies, thereby introducing direct competition as a mechanism for reducing prices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unlike the Labor government, which lacked the resolve to implement the PSA report, changing its mind repeatedly over four years, we have acted decisively on those recommendations. But we have not done so precipitantly&mdash;or without regard to possible changes in the market and market behaviour since 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In our election commitments we stated that we would consult industry and the community on the most effective means of lowering prices for music CDs, and we have done so. Views were sought from a wide cross-section of the Australian music and copyright industries, including representatives of performers, record producers and music publishers, and from consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our decision to follow, in essence, the recommendation of the PSA reflects this government's conclusion that insufficient effort had been made by the recording industry to embrace competition and provide world competitive pricing. While the estimates of the amount of the reduction vary, all the economic advice obtained suggests that allowing importation of legitimate CDs will 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> lead to a reduction in prices. It also has the potential to expand availability of overseas recordings in response to consumer demand, and will give retailers freedom of choice in sourcing supplies. If expected price reductions lead to increased sales, artists receiving royalty income from sales may well achieve a net gain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, we are aware of the industry arguments that allowing importation will reduce returns and allow greater potential for importation of pirate copies of sound recordings into Australia. The bill responds fully to those concerns, so far as they are justified, in the following way:</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It maintains all existing copyright owners' rights to take action against pirate copies of sound recordings.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It limits permitted imports to legitimate copies, that is, copies of sound recordings made in conformity with the copyright law where they were made and with the consent of the maker of the original recording.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It gives very substantial procedural assistance to sound recording copyright owners in civil actions by shifting to the defendant the onus of establishing that a copy that was imported without the copyright owner's consent is not a pirate copy.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> And it increases and simplifies the penalties for all primary copyright piracy offences in the act.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Importation of legitimate copies of sound recordings</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill largely achieves its effect through excluding what are defined as `non&hyphen;infringing copies' of sound recordings from the rights to take action for unauthorised importation. The crucial provision is therefore the definition of `non-infringing copy'. Such a copy must have been made without infringing any law in the country where it was made protecting copyright in any musical or other work used in the sound recording. In addition, it must have been made with the consent of the producer of the original sound recording or other person who is the copyright owner. If the country where the copy was made does not protect sound recordings then the law of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10973"> country where the original recording was made comes into play.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The definition of `non-infringing copy' is explained in greater detail in the explanatory memorandum. It is important to note that the definition is designed to ensure that the copies allowed to be imported will be legitimate copies only, while avoiding prejudice to Australia's general trade relations and obligations.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Increase in copyright piracy penalties</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As has been mentioned, the bill will also boost and simplify the primary penalty provisions in the act. We are committed to a copyright system that works. The bill proposes to amend the act to provide that all primary infringement offences&mdash;not just those for infringement of copyright in sound recordings&mdash;will be subject to fines of up to $55,000 for individuals and $275,000 for corporations. This is a 10 per cent increase over existing maximum penalties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The maximum term of five years imprisonment that may currently be imposed as an alternative, or in addition, to a fine for some copyright offences by individuals will apply across all the primary infringement offences. The language and form of these penalty provisions will also be adjusted to reflect current usage for imposition of penalties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The act presently limits the discretion of the courts by restricting the maximum penalty for each infringing article, such as a book or a software disk. However, the value of the copyright carried on the disk or in the book may vary considerably. The amendments will remove maximum penalties for each infringing copy. The maximum will apply whether there is one or many infringing copies. The current distinction between the maximum penalty for a first offence and that for a subsequent offence is also removed for these offences. And last, the setting of maximum penalties for infringements related to films at different levels to those for infringements for other copyright subject matter is no longer justifiable or necessary, and is also done away with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These changes, while primarily aimed at modernising these penalty provisions, also 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> send a clear message to the courts, as well as would-be offenders, that copyright piracy offences are serious matters. The new approach provided for in the bill will emphasise to the courts the importance of their giving due weight to the gravity of the offences before them&mdash;having regard to the possible maximum penalties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The increase in maximum penalties will extend to offences against performers' rights, such as making `bootleg' recordings&mdash;that is, recordings of performances not authorised by the performers. This will act as a deterrent to those who might consider the removal of rights over parallel importation to offer a greater opportunity for commercial importation of copies of bootleg recordings, if not pirate copies of authorised recordings.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Facilitating copyright infringement proceedings</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To underline further the government's commitment to effective enforcement of copyright, the bill includes a new provision to facilitate civil actions for infringement by importation of pirate copies of recordings. In such cases, once the plaintiff has established that the copy was imported without the copyright owner's consent, it will be up to the defendant to show, to the civil standard of proof, that the copy was made without infringing copyright in the country where it was made. This will provide strong incentive to importers taking advantage of the new opportunity to import CDs to obtain their supplies from reputable sources.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is an important measure that should be supported by all members who are interested in fair competition and a better deal for Australian consumers. The measures to boost and simplify the penalties and enforcement procedures are substantive and wide reaching. The bill demonstrates our commitment to an effective and practical act that looks after the legitimate interests of copyright owners while also delivering benefits to Australian consumers. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the bill.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to speak on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R346">Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) Bill 1997</XREF> . This legislation puts responsibility back onto those seeking financial assistance from the Australian taxpayer. For too long there has been a culture of dependency that has developed that the Australian taxpayer owes one a living. Unfortunately, that culture developed during the years of the former government, which deliberately manufactured a constituency that it thought it could call its own which was dependent on welfare.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the youth allowance was announced, it was lauded by editorials around the nation, which is an uncommon occurrence. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald&hyphen;Sun</EMPHASIS> welcomed the new payments saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This age group&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is, the age group to which the allowance applies&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is much too young to begin life in an environment which could lead them into the mistaken belief that the world owes them a living.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph</EMPHASIS>  said the allowance would:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . end the rort of using the dole as pocket money for a few months and possibly a few years of loafing around.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The youth allowance achieves two goals: it simplifies income support arrangements for our younger Australians, and it ensures the income support for young Australians will better equip them to enter the labour market through education and training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The youth allowance replaces five youth income support programs, namely, Austudy, the youth training allowance, newstart for 16&hyphen; to 20&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds, sickness allowance and the more than minimum rate of family payment for secondary students 16 to 18 not receiving 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Austudy. The purpose of this allowance is to make sure that young people are not better off on the dole than if they were receiving training or education. Too often we hear stories of people spending their days on the beach because there is no incentive for them to find work and they are happy to bludge off the taxpayer. Too often we are told these stories are just anecdotes or idle gossip. I can assure you that I know people&mdash;and I am sure most members of this House would know of people&mdash;who have `rorted the system' and bludged off the dole. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> magazine recently reviewed this situation, as has Channel 9's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Current Affair</EMPHASIS>. I would commend to people in the House a very interesting article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> on how the system is still being rorted&mdash;and it is not gossip or innuendo.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of the day, those who use the dole as pocket money will not improve their opportunities to find work, they will not improve their self&hyphen;esteem one iota, and they will not improve their knowledge by being happy getting paid to do nothing. It is a one&hyphen;way spiral to nowhere. While I have no problem seeing hard&hyphen;earned taxpayers' dollars going to people needing income support because they want to further themselves in education or training and are doing their damnedest to find employment and to provide for themselves or their families&mdash;most of the people we are talking about probably do not have a family at this stage&mdash;there are some in the community who are happy to shirk their responsibilities and leave the problem of income support to the battling Australian taxpayer. And those unwilling to accept responsibility to help themselves, quite frankly, do not deserve income support if they are unwilling to put that effort in themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill places the burden back on the recipient and takes some of the burden off the taxpayer. The government is constantly scrutinised&mdash;quite rightly&mdash;and has to be accountable for the taxpayers' money, yet there are instances where there is no accountability on recipients of taxpayers' money. This bill makes it perfectly clear that young people can receive income support, but only if they are 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10975"> prepared to better themselves by training or education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia, over recent decades, has faced technological, social and economic changes which impact on the decisions of government. Governments have responded with reform to our financial system, labour markets, trade and other areas to meet the challenges that have been presented by these changing demographics. One area where reform has been lacking has been in welfare&mdash;that is, until the election of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government will go down in history as the government that gave Australian taxpayers value for money. We started it with the work for the dole scheme, which has proven incredibly popular all over Australia and in my seat of Stirling, and we are continuing with this new youth allowance. The youth allowance will provide income support to young Australians, but it is designed so that they cannot be better off doing nothing; they must be in training or education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation is also complemented by other major and far-sighted reforms of this government. It seeks to keep families together. Families, of course, have been made better off by the family tax initiative, and it will ensure that those who previously thought it was a great opportunity to leave home, be paid the dole and then also get rent assistance will be made to think again. I think every single member of this House would have had examples of parents coming to them absolutely distraught, because the government of the day had aided and abetted their young people to leave home, very often in less than desirable circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other reforms tied in with this are our industrial relations reforms, reforms supported by Labor's unofficial candidate for Dickson. Anyone who read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS> last week will see why Western Australia has consistently lower youth unemployment levels than all other states in the nation. It is because of the excellent reforms introduced by the Court government led by labour relations minister, Graham Kierath.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Employers find it easier to employ young people in Western Australia than elsewhere. The proof of that is in the figures. It is not 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> resources which make Western Australia the state with the best youth unemployment figures; it is the flexible industrial relations regime that we have. Labor, of course, are opposed to these reforms; but their opposition to the reforms means that they are opposed to giving young people jobs and opportunities. With similar federal reforms, we will ensure young people are given better opportunities under our industrial relations system to get work than they had under the previous government. That is the most important thing we can do: give young Australians meaningful employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over time, with all our reforms taking effect, the results will flow through. We will reduce youth unemployment in this nation because of the many reforms that we are implementing. Labor had 13 years and did nothing; yet they expect us to turn it around in 18 months. Give us twice that long and the results will start to shine through, as all Australians will see.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill does not simply seek to implement a savings measure. It will cost $25 million in the first year. It is a genuine reform to our welfare system which I wholeheartedly endorse. It is often said that the best welfare one can be given is a job, and this legislation removes the incentive for young Australians to not work and puts in place the right measures to ensure that young Australians pursue all opportunities to ensure they are best equipped to enter the work force. Just recently I had a young lady visit my office. She asked me quite barefacedly why on earth should she possibly go out looking for a job; she had just left school and she intended to spend a couple of years `bumming it'. I mentioned to her this particular legislation that we are bringing into force and she said, `Oh, God; it looks like I'll have to find something to do,' laughing the whole time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under Labor welfare was like breast milk, if I can use that analogy: once on, it was difficult to wean recipients off. This was a deliberate measure, as I have said before, by Labor to manufacture a constituency of their own. They wanted people to be dependent on them and the benefits that they offered because that was where they saw their votes. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10976"> The state of the economy came last. We saw that at the last few elections: `Vote for the coalition and you lose your benefits'&mdash;that was the scare campaign being put around. They wanted people dependent on them for welfare like babies are dependent on their mothers for breast milk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has now commenced the process of weaning people off welfare dependency, and we will continue this process. This bill is another step in that process. This bill is fair. The incentive now is not to not work. The message is: if you want income support from the Australian taxpayer, then you must be accountable to the taxpayer by seeking training or education in return for those benefits. Reciprocal obligation is a certain phrase that springs to mind in this. I welcome this legislation. It is far sighted and taxpayer friendly, and it will improve the lot of young Australians.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It gives me great pleasure to rise today to speak in support of the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R346">Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) Bill 1997</XREF> . From 1 July next year Australia's young people will have government income support with the flexibility not available under the current arrangements. The introduction of the common youth allowance is the coalition's response to the real concerns of young people and their families about the inefficiencies and inequalities of current income support systems in dealing with their different circumstances. One of the most concerning aspects of the current system results in young people on the dole being paid more than those trying to get a further education through full-time study. Also, if your circumstances change even slightly, you often have your benefits cut off completely. You may be forced to reapply for another type of benefit. The extra paperwork and inevitable delays often cause a lot of anguish and confusion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current system is also unsatisfactory for those under the age of 25 whose circumstances change from being a full-time student to being unemployed. They have to wait 13 weeks before being able to claim benefits. As unemployment benefits presently pay a higher 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> rate of allowance than Austudy, students are often tempted to go on the dole instead of continuing their education. This not only is a drain on public welfare but also results in young people not completing their education and consequently finding it very difficult to get a job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The school retention rates of young people have been falling from a high of 77 per cent in 1992 to a rate of 71 per cent in 1996. This is of great concern to the government. It is a sad fact that young people who leave school without completing year 12 are almost three times more likely to be unemployed. Labor encouraged youth unemployment by paying unemployment benefits to 16&hyphen; and 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds who discovered that going on the dole was a more attractive alternative to continuing study or training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition is committed to ensuring that our young people are given the chance to prepare themselves for the jobs market. By introducing the youth allowance, the government is making it an easier and more attractive proposition to continue some type of further education. There are currently 560,000 young people on income support. Of those, 416,000 are students between the ages of 16 and 25, and 144,000 young Australians between the ages of 16 and 21 are on unemployment benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The common youth allowance will replace the youth training allowance, newstart allowance and sickness allowance for 16&hyphen; to 20-year-olds and most 15-year-olds receiving these allowances, Austudy for students aged between 16 and 24 inclusive and older if the student commences a course prior to turning 25 years, and 15-year-olds receiving Austudy and the `more than minimum family payment' for secondary students aged between 16 and 18 not receiving Austudy. Territorians may be interested to know that the youth allowance will not replace Abstudy or the assistance for the isolated children scheme. It will also not replace the pensioner education supplement, the disability support pension, the sole parent pension, the parenting allowance, the veterans' children education scheme or wage top-up agreements for apprentices and trainees. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10977">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The youth allowance will benefit students in the following ways. Students will be eligible to receive rent assistance for the first time. There will be an increase in the payment for those under 18 and living away from home. Students will be more likely to qualify as `independent' under the new, more lenient assessment. The government has abolished the $1,000 payment limit. This is an important reform, as currently students who are assessed as being eligible for anything less than $1,000 in benefits per year actually receive nothing. By abolishing the $1,000 limit, about 41,000 students will benefit by up to $38 a fortnight. Students will be able to apply for an interest&hyphen;free advance loan of $500 which is repaid through lower fortnightly youth allowance payments over a six&hyphen;month period. I expect this money will be very useful for some people in purchasing textbooks and paying rental bonds or other related expenses which occur at the beginning of the year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The family income cut-off rate has been increased, which means more students will have a better chance of qualifying for the youth allowance. As I have mentioned, the youth allowance will replace the youth training, newstart and sickness allowances for those young people looking for work. However, the youth allowance will benefit job seekers who are under 21 by the abolition of the 13&hyphen;week education leaver waiting period, which will mean an extra $1,700 for families with school leavers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Full-time students who are between study programs, including vacation periods, will still be regarded as full time as long as they intend to resume study in the next semester. Part-time students will be eligible for the youth allowance if they satisfy a full-time activity load by undertaking a training course or looking for short-term or casual work. Higher rates of allowances and rent assistance will be paid to those under 18 who live away from home but continue year 12 equivalent studies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the government would hope that the under&hyphen;18s would continue study or be in some type of training, the youth allowance does not abolish the dole for those unable to participate in further education. Unemployed people over 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the age of 21 will continue to receive newstart allowance as before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another important element of the government's youth allowance proposal is the introduction of consistent parental means testing, which will remove one of the major anomalies between differing financial support systems for young people. Students aged 16 to 24 and unemployed people under 18 are already subject to parental means testing. Extending the parental means test will ensure that all young people are treated equally. We will encourage parental support and ensure that young people in similar circumstances have similar entitlements which will remove the disincentives to study.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unemployed young people aged between 18 and 25 living at home with parental incomes over $41,000 will be ineligible for the youth allowance. Young people living out of home but with a parental income of $58,000 or more will similarly be ineligible for assistance. Of course, higher income levels exist for families with additional children. The coalition's means test is more generous than Labor's. The cut-out under Labor was $37,000 for a family with one child at home. As I have mentioned, it is $41,000 under the coalition and business people will still be able to get a 50 per cent discount on business assets, as they currently do for Austudy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To qualify for the youth allowance, young people aged 18 and over will need to be studying full time, in training, looking for a job or a combination of these activities. Young people under 18 will receive the youth allowance if they are in full-time study or training or if they meet special exemption criteria like being sick or homeless or face certain special circumstances which restrict their capacity to complete study. There is also an exemption of young Australians, which is particularly relevant to Territorians, from the full-time education or training requirements if they are living in remote areas and face severe limits or education and training opportunities. Young people who are unable to secure a position in an educational or training organisation are also exempted from this requirement until such time as they can access a place.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10978">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the first time, young Territorians in full-time study will be eligible for rent assistance, pharmaceutical and remote area allowances. This could be as much as an extra $100 per fortnight for our remote or regional students in rent assistance alone, and I welcome this announcement. I also welcome the fact that the fares allowance currently payable to tertiary students under the provisions of Austudy will continue to be available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Very few people are expected to lose income support under the youth allowance. The vast majority of young people will be unaffected. Those who are negatively affected will be young people who are able to return to study but choose not to. The introduction of an income bank for full-time students or those in full-time accredited training who work part time is another sensible reform. This will enable students to accumulate unused fortnightly income&hyphen;free areas up to a limit of $6,000. This is in recognition that students usually earn the bulk of their money during holiday periods. This means that at the end of the year a student may have accumulated a fairly substantial amount in their income bank. They can then up earn up to that amount during the holidays before their fortnightly youth allowance payment is affected. So, instead of having their fortnightly payments affected by holiday work straightaway, we are protecting their income and we are providing the incentive to gain employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under Labor, young people were offered financial incentives to leave school and go on the dole. By doing this, Labor encouraged youth unemployment so that it increased to a staggering 32.3 per cent, five per cent higher than when they came to office. Under the previous Labor government, apprenticeships fell to their lowest level in 30 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must just add that the coalition has already allocated $550 million dollars to new apprenticeships over the next four years. Also, a total of $265 million has been set aside for more than 100,000 new apprenticeships and traineeships for next year. Again, we are showing a commitment to young Australians so lacking in the Labor years.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Student and welfare groups in my electorate have come to see me to discuss the benefits of the youth allowance. There is a lot of community interest in this legislation, and I welcome the opportunity to meet with interested parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another coalition initiative for young Australians, namely, the work for the dole scheme, also has wide support in our community. I have just completed a survey of the Northern Territory which showed that 95 per cent of my electorate support the work for the dole scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The national reaction to the youth allowance has been very positive. Parent and welfare groups, including the Brotherhood of St Laurence, have all applauded the government for providing incentives to young Australians. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> has hailed it as `desirable and overdue'. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> said that the government's decision should be `vigorously applauded' and went further to add what we all know is true&mdash;that is, `the current system has clearly not worked'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This policy is part of the government's push for all school leavers to acquire further education, whether it be a university degree, a TAFE qualification, a trade through an apprenticeship, or some form of accredited training. However, it is important to note, as mentioned by many other members on this side, that the introduction of the common youth allowance is not a savings measure; it will cost an extra $25 million in its first year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reform of government income support for young Australians is one of the most important acts of this government. For once, all young Australians will be treated equally, regardless of their situation or choices in education and training. It is vitally important that young Australians are equipped to face the highly competitive jobs market; the incentives provided by the youth allowance will help to achieve this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just a few moments ago, I mentioned the fact that I had carried out a survey in my electorate. That survey was carried out on different things, but it included the youth allowance because I knew that might be an issue of interest. From listening to what 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10979"> members opposite have had to say about the youth allowance, one would feel as though a picture of doom and gloom has been painted clearly before them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As do most other members of this House, I regularly produce a newsletter. This is done to provide constituents throughout our electorates with information about what is going on and what might be the issues of the day. Just recently, as early as November, in my newsletter I highlighted the common youth allowance. I was not trying to hide from it because I thought it was a very good measure that the coalition government was taking. There, as you can see in the document I hold up, the common youth allowance has been highlighted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I knew there may be some reaction in the community also. So I invited a group which had formed in May of 1997, calling itself the CYA action group. That group had formed in an attempt to get people more or less to say that the common youth allowance was not going to work and that it was going to affect many people in the community. So, not only have I highlighted what the common youth allowance does in my newsletter, but most of the words I have used in my remarks this afternoon have been used in my newsletter. Therefore, it is not that I am saying one thing in my news letter and another to the parliament. In fact, what is in my newsletter almost correlates with what I have said this afternoon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said, I gave the people of the CYA, who were going to oppose the common youth allowance, the opportunity to place a little note in my newsletter to try to encourage members of the community between the ages of 16 and 18 to come out, in an attempt to discover whether or not we were on the right track. I will read out the little piece that the action group put in; it is important, as I have something further to say about it. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In May 1997 a group of community workers formed with a united interest of addressing the impacts of the Common Youth Allowance in the NT. The group is called <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The Common Youth Allowance Action Group</EMPHASIS> . One of the group's concerns is that the introduction of the Common Youth Allowance will catch many families un 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> awares. Sixteen to eighteen year olds will no longer be able to access the Dole, so you or your family members need to consider the consequences of leaving school or further training.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are services available to assist you to make such decisions. You can contact . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Then there are the details of two members of the Northern Territory University Students Union in Darwin, and one other, who can be contacted for further information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have read out that piece of my newsletter for a reason, that is, this particular newsletter went out early in November and I can honestly say that, in the last three weeks since it has been in the public arena, I have not had more than two or three inquiries in both of my electoral offices. As you know, I have one electoral office in Darwin and one in Alice Springs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When one sits and listens to what the opposition have been saying in this debate for the last couple of sittings, one would think that we are on the wrong track. But I have to dispute that. If we were in opposition&mdash;and, thank God, I have never been in opposition and do not intend to get into opposition, and I have been a member of parliament for a number of years&mdash;I suppose we would have to say of the government of the day, `They've got some good news; how can we detract from it, how can we sink it, how can we cut it away?' We have heard, time after time, member after member continually cutting away, condemning the proposals of the government, to try to get a clearer and better direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All I can honestly say is that it is a fact that I have circulated this newsletter to every household. I did not say that earlier; I said that I had produced a newsletter. But this particular newsletter has gone into every household in the Northern Territory&mdash;not only into the Darwin region but also into the rural regions. I am satisfied with the information that I have put into the newsletter, and I am more than satisfied with the comments that I have made this afternoon in support of the common youth allowance. Time after time with the announcements of good news by this government, the stark reality is that the opposition, through the implementation of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10980"> their strategies, have to work to try to cut that good news down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I sincerely believe that this is going to help a lot of our young Australians, and that is important. Not only does it help our young Australians; it helps the families&mdash;because there are increases and variations. The other important aspect is that the income bank will give students the opportunity to plan the following school year. Because of family circumstances some students have to have a part-time job in order to further their education. They may get a job over the Christmas holidays in Myers, David Jones or the local garage and earn quite a swag of money. If they go over a certain income level, the tax office will take their portion out of it. The income bank that we now have in our system will certainly give them the opportunity to plan the following school year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The direction the coalition is taking with this and other matters relating to the family and taxation rebates will provide assistance to them. Another important factor is the rental assistance that will come through this program. I compliment the Minister for Social Security, Senator Newman. She has come under a bit of pressure, but not from the community at large, who recognise that this legislation is a step towards providing assistance to those young people who are really in need. That is important. She has moved in the right direction to provide assistance to our young people. When this bill eventually goes to the second and third readings it should be supported by members opposite because it is providing a resource to the young people of Australia, whom they purport to represent as well. They should take that into consideration because this is for all young Australians. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The youth allowance, as proposed in the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R346">Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) Bill 1997</XREF> , is to be commended. As the previous speaker, the member for Northern Territory (Mr Dondas), has said, Senator Newman has put a lot of hard work into this legislation, which I am sure will be well received by the general community, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> particularly the youth who will be affected by this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although there are some aspects of the bill that I have a problem with, on the whole the policy is heading in the right direction. That is what it is all about&mdash;getting things right for the people and the youth of this great nation. This bill replaces a number of different payments, reduces the complexity and duplication and provides a more flexible system of income support for our young people. People claiming the youth allowance will have to meet activity test requirements and their parents will have to meet a parental income test. Parents on high incomes will be required to support their own children instead of calling on the taxpayer. Something I campaigned very strongly about during the March 1996 election was that we would tidy up the use of taxpayers' money on people in the community. If you are drawing down a benefit from the taxpayers of this country, it is only fair that you should contribute as well. This is fair and equitable for all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I do not have a problem with either of these requirements, I do have some reservations that the parental income test of $41,000 is too low to be able to support a family with a young adult. This level of income is not that flash. I would much prefer to see the parental income test raised to, say, $50,000. The implications of forcing parents on this level of income to support their own children will be a potential increase in the incidence of homelessness, possible teenage suicides, domestic and family violence and teenage pregnancies. It may also increase juvenile crime in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would hate to think that I was pre&hyphen;empting something that a bill may produce, but there is a trend in some communities, particularly in relation to juvenile crime, that youth are trying to get more money for various things. Admittedly, only a small minority are doing that. I am quietly confident that we can change that trend, particularly as a result of the action that has been taken by the Queensland state government on juvenile crime. We are talking about something that may not happen but it is has the potential of happening and needs to be looked at very closely. We 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10981"> cannot afford to have this type of situation develop in families. I believe that if we provide a reasonable parental income test level, the potential of these incidents happening will be severely limited.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last week I attended a meeting of local youth inter&hyphen;agency groups who raised a number of issues concerning the youth allowance. This group of people, in particular Trisha Millar of Youth Trek, Rockhampton, are in the front line when dealing with youth issues and the problems young people have to deal with in today's fast moving society. They are concerned that proposed subsection 543A(2), in most circumstances, will in effect disqualify young people under 18 years of age from the youth allowance. They pointed out that in the city of Rockhampton and particularly in the more isolated areas of my electorate the opportunities for training outside the high school are very limited. In addition, we have canned the expensive and often useless labour market programs, so alternative training opportunities for these young people are not in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It must be noted that labour market programs hid people from the unemployment queues, making it look like unemployment had decreased. All Labor did was hide people in those labour market programs. That was very deceptive. I congratulate this government for not allowing that to happen. I would like to see the government provide some additional funding for appropriate training schemes to be established in regional areas to cater for this potential problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Young people who do drop out of school or are expelled from school will find it even harder to obtain training or further education, so they are a vulnerable section of the community that we must address. It should be noted, I guess, that they would be only a small minority, but it is like anything&mdash;we have to ensure that we have a system that is fair and equitable for all. Work for the dole and Green Corps schemes will not necessarily provide the skill base for these young people to get a job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The scheme will provide them with self&hyphen;esteem and life skills, and that is the idea of those programs: self&hyphen;esteem and life skills. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> They were not necessarily put there to train people and give them certificated vocational training programs; they were there, as I said, to provide those particular things. This is something we need to look at. The programs will not raise their educational standard nor, as I said, will the young people have a certificate of job skills when they complete them, which may give them problems when they want to move into the competitive marketplace. With that in mind, there needs to be a contingency plan in place to help this section of the community before the youth allowance is up and running, not for use as a bandaid when things go wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other issues raised by youth groups in my electorate are not to make the legislation retrospective and that anyone correctly receiving a benefit should not be disadvantaged. This is a very important point that came out when we met this group of people, and I think it is something that we need to look at and give some very strong thought to. They also want to see some more details on certain aspects of the legislation, such as the criteria to access homelessness payments and the limited information about the granting of exemptions, how they are applied and how they are reviewed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The youth groups were also extremely supportive of the government's policy. As I have gone through this and spoken about it, I have looked very closely at both sides of the debate. It is very important if you are going to talk on these issues that you do not cloud them and say, `It's great stuff.' You have to put the pros and cons. I have just discussed what we would consider to be the downside. As far as the up side is concerned, the groups were very supportive of this government's policy. For the first time young people will be able to gain access to rent assistance and pharmaceutical benefits. Many young people will also gain increased benefits, as well as being entitled to a reasonable `income free' area up to a maximum of $6,000 so they can undertake some holiday or casual employment to support themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With any substantial changes to existing policy, there will always be concerns raised by those that will be affected. All we have to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10982"> do is make sure a contingency plan is in place to address these concerns, and that assistance, guidance and education is readily available to support the people that will be affected, as well as the people in the community who have to work with these young people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unemployment, particularly among the young, continues to cause us great concern, despite a considerable number of reforms and incentives provided by this coalition government. Most politicians are concerned about it, and many of them have been given a variety of advice from their constituents on how best to create more employment and reduce unemployment. But have you heard the latest from the ALP? The Labor Party's new employment policy, which still has to be endorsed by the ALP National Executive on Friday, makes the claim that it intends to get unemployment down to 5 per cent, or what it prefers to call `full employment'. And how does the ALP plan to reduce unemployment?<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Create more jobs? No. Boost economic growth?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Under you, when would unemployment decrease? There is no answer. So, if the ALP are going to provide no additional jobs or economic growth, no labor market deregulation or wage flexibility, no reduction of business imposts and no incentives for employers, no detailed strategy and no deadline, how are they going to create full employment? The magical answer is job sharing. Good old Martin Ferguson came up with this idea. It reminds me of a letter to the editor I saw in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS>  some months 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ago. It was in response to the member for Batman's bright idea of job sharing. Good on you, Martin; this was a beauty. But I never actually saw Martin's response to the individual who wrote in.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LK6">Mr MAREK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Okay, the response of the member for Batman. The individual said he wanted to share the job of the member for Batman. Wouldn't that be great? This individual wanted to come in and take up the position of the member for Batman. That would be called job sharing. When you think about it, you would actually have two representatives for Batman. What a team you would have: Batman and Robin. I can just imagine what it would be like. What would happen to the employers? Less work, same pay. I am sure the employers are going to go a long way to try to provide all the additional funding to take on twice as many people and train all the people. This is interesting. It is a shame that the member for Batman, Martin Ferguson, was not here to be able to respond. I would have liked to have heard what he had to say.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Anyway, under Labor these fortunate people that have a job would be required to reduce their working hours, stop doing overtime, retire early or go on long holidays so that the unemployed can share the benefits of that job. This pie in the sky plan by Labor indicates they have accepted there are no more jobs that can be created in our communities and the existing work force will be forced to share their job with someone else. I think it is a terrible idea but, never mind, if the member for Batman wants to come along and get that going, I am sure the ALP would be more than happy to share his job with someone from the National Party or someone from the Liberal Party. I am very sure we could organise something there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a nutshell, this is the ALP's great, forward thinking plan to reduce unemployment. In fact, it is more like another one of the failed remedies from the past. It is a return to compulsory unionism, the closed shop, centralised wage fixing at the cost of enterprise bargaining and Australian work 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="10983"> place agreements, minimum award rates and inflexible working conditions. It is a giant step backwards, it is outdated and it shows that Labor has not learned from its past failures. It is a stale and tired party that thinks all its problems have been solved since it has taken on Cheryl Kernot. But I have news for you, because the rank and file are pretty impressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Such stagnant policies do not provide long-term employment, let alone reduce unemployment levels. The Labor Party's intention to reinstate the interventionist role of the Industrial Relations Commission is short-sighted and will do nothing other than entrench inefficient work practices and give the union hierarchy the security and the platform they need to beat their chests. Likewise, the AIRC will do absolutely nothing to create more jobs and will cost jobs by reducing the demand for labour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to these ALP industrial relations policies, the Labor Party will also recycle the worn&hyphen;out training schemes for the long-term unemployed. You know, the labour market programs that cost, I think, $147,000 a head&mdash;an incredible amount of money. They were absolutely farcical, were of no significant benefit and provided limited opportunities for employment&mdash;another blatant waste of taxpayers' money by the ALP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the real reason that the ALP introduced those expensive training schemes was to give them the opportunity to manipulate the unemployment figures. I touched on this issue a while ago. When someone is officially training for a job, they are not considered to be unemployed. In this way the ALP can tell the public that they have reduced unemployment, but they have only hidden the bodies behind a training facade. This is a blueprint for disaster.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the ALP think the jobs are not there, why put people through environmental training courses? Their ulterior motive is to disguise the true unemployment figures&mdash;unlike the new programs that we have put in place, such as the work for the dole program, which is benefiting society and stimulating the youth, and the Green Corps. With those programs we told people exactly what our intentions were, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and those programs are working very well. I think that is a great benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as employment is concerned, I think we need to look at going down another track. I believe this government has the foresight to make it happen. I am talking about new jobs&mdash;more dollars provided for sciences and for the development of new industries for the youth of this great nation. I have heard the ALP talk of all these farcical ideas in relation to R&amp;D. We have seen that they have not been successful. If we could put some real money into these sciences and develop new industries and new jobs for our youth, it would give our youth something great to look forward to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As honourable members know, times are changing. The jobs of the past are not necessarily the jobs of the future. I am talking particularly of jobs like boilermaking and fitting and turning. Those trades were once very prevalent, but they have started dissolving and changing into fitter/welders. Trades have changed. I think that as times change legislation needs to change. The way jobs are done also needs to change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) has done a very good job of putting this package together. I think it is a great plan that deserves our support. I know a lot of my colleagues feel the same way. I commend the bill to the House and applaud Senator Newman for ensuring that the safeguards are there. Not only is she competent; she will put a great proposal forward.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R346">Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) Bill 1997</XREF>  is about encouraging young people to stay at school, encouraging them to stay at home with their families and sending a message that when you complete your education it is time to get a job. The youth allowance makes income support arrangements for young people simpler and more flexible. For younger students, in particular, it creates a real incentive to complete year 12 or  equivalent before they look for full-time employment. One of the key factors in the employment of young people today is getting them into the habit of getting up in the morning and going to work five days a

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To qualify for youth allowance, young people aged 18 and over will need to be undertaking full-time study, training or job search or a combination of any of these activities. Young people under the age of 18 will need to participate in full-time education or training&mdash;unless they meet criteria for special exemption such as illness, homelessness or being unable to secure an appropriate education or training place&mdash;in order to receive the youth allowance payment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A parental means test that already applies to full-time students up to their 25th birthday will now apply to other young people up to their 21st birthday. Young people are subject to parental means tests if they are considered dependent. Exemptions from the parental means test will be available to those who meet criteria for independence or special disadvantage.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to talk about a company called Corval, on Kurrajong Avenue, St Marys, which last week tragically was placed in voluntary administration and wound up. The purpose of raising the matter tonight is to talk about the plight of the workers, who in the main are good, honest and hardworking women from my electorate who work in the textile and clothing industry. They have lost all of their long service leave entitlements, all of their holiday entitlements and, in many cases&mdash;as is the case of the constituent who raised the problem with me, Terri Coble, who is a friend of mine&mdash;have been there for something like 20 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an absolutely disgraceful situation. You may ask why the company was placed into voluntary administration. It is because the company owed the taxation department more than $100,000 of PAYE taxpayers' money in tax, which had not been remitted to the Taxation Office. It was only then that the office wrote to the directors, saying to them that, notwithstanding it was a proprietary limited company, if they did not remit the money or respond within 14 days, as directors they would become personally liable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bank has something to answer for, too. They have a charge over the machinery of the company as well as over one of the directors' houses. The real tragedy, after talking to both the local manager appointed to the company and the administrator appointed by the court, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10985"> is that, if this company had sought some assistance 12 months earlier, it may very well have been able to trade out of its current problems. In particular, it would have been able to be sold as a going concern and those workers' funds would have been protected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an absolute disgrace that directors of companies can knowingly withhold, with immunity, PAYE workers' tax deductions and not face criminal prosecution. Worse still, company directors can use the money from long service leave and holiday pay that the workers have worked very hard for, and in a dedicated and loyal fashion, for the trading of the company. The workers have absolutely no protection. In ranking the debt, you have taxation, the bank and the workers. This is totally unsatisfactory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I really believe that penalties should be imposed on people, whether they are sole operators, partnerships or proprietary limited companies, who use their workers' entitlements in the business of the firm. Workers' entitlements really should be set aside in a trust.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where companies do this, I believe that there should be a liability for criminal prosecution. I ask the Commissioner of Taxation: why is it that with immunity directors can fail to forward PAYE taxation deductions? Why are there no prosecutions launched against the directors? If it was a worker snatching money out of a firm, or a worker in the Taxation Office, of course there would be criminal prosecution. But there is immunity for directors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not a level playing field. It is not fair. It is not just. This parliament&mdash;all members, whether they are on this side or the other side of the House&mdash;should be aware of what is happening to workers' entitlements when firms go belly&hyphen;up. I do not know how members would feel if their entitlements had been squandered by someone else, how they would feel if they were in that situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a tragedy. I would have liked to see this firm continue in employment. I would have liked to see it successfully trade. It is a pity that the directors did not have enough sense to seek help 12 months earlier. Not only might they be better off now but in particular 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the workers and the Australian Taxation Office might be better off.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister has said that finally we are going to make a major effort to address the issue of renewable energy resource development. This is an issue that I have posed in this House on a number of occasions, in daily newspapers and in other forums proposing that we grab a hold of opportunities which we have in Australia that are not available to the rest of the world.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those two elements make us different from any other nation on earth.

There is enough power available there, from the rise and fall of tides through narrow inlets, to generate enough electricity to power Australia three times of our total requirements today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only does the technology exist but Tidal Power Australia has also proposed a station to generate 48 megawatts of power at Derby in Western Australia and I am encouraging the Prime Minister and the new council to give financial, practical and coordination assistance to that project so that we have it operating before the year 2000&mdash;before the Olympics&mdash;so we can demonstrate to the world some of our free, clean, green energy potential and credentials.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another technology exists which the rest of the world has attempted to tap into but so far unsuccessfully. That is geothermal energy. In 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10986"> modern technology it is simply called `dry, hot rocks'. Down under the crust of the earth there are locations where the subsurface, in rock form, holds a great deal of heat. Australia has a particular granite substructure which causes those rocks to fracture in generally a horizontal direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that in the Cooper Basin and the Hunter Valley there is a region of immense potential where temperatures in excess of 250 degrees Celsius exist at a level of something like 5,000 feet below the surface. If you drill a vertical hole, case it and force water down the hole, it disperses horizontally and comes back up a second hole in a superheated form and can run steam turbines, generate electricity and feed into the grid. I am advised by Dr Doone Wyborn, of the ANU, that there is enough potential in the Hunter Valley alone to provide all the electric power needs for the entire state of New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ladies and gentlemen, we need to quit burning carbon. Future generations of the world are going to need our usable carbon resources for many purposes, whether they be carbon fibre masts for yachts, whether it be plastics or new things that we design and that the scientists and engineers come up with. We need to conserve our carbon and burning it means we do not get it back&mdash;we simply send it up into the stratosphere. If we can develop our tides and develop dry, hot rocks, we can prove to the world that there is a way forward and that we do not have to be dependent on oil, coal and natural gas for ever and ever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not saying that we change our coal technology today but I am saying that as soon as possible we make the engineering and scientific effort to bring these kinds of projects on line not only to demonstrate to us that we can do it but also to make a real difference in the reduction in the use of carbon in the world and particularly in regard to putting carbon into the upper atmosphere.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="10986"><TITLE>Freedom of Speech

In Australia people are entitled to express views contrary to government without members of the government seeking to denigrate individuals or, more importantly, religious institutions.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On that note I also want to raise this evening something as fundamental as freedom of speech. That goes to the question of the access of Australians, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds, to free and public libraries. I speak this evening about the sacking and looting of libraries. That has been an efficient tactic of authoritarian regimes right down through the ages&mdash;the Romans did it, the Barbarians did it, Genghis Khan did it, the Crusaders did it, Henry VIII did it and the Nazis did it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The free public libraries of Victoria are an essential democratic value and so it is no wonder that the administrator of Darebin in my seat of Batman, imposed on the local people by Jeff Kennett when he sacked the democratically elected Darebin City Council, is now talking of shutting down public libraries and offering our libraries to the private sector, thanks to Jeff Kennett's loony, compulsory, competitive tendering model.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Public lending libraries, like state education, were established to help all Australians to participate equally in a democratic society as educated and informed citizens. The public libraries, like state education, were established to provide opportunities for all Australians to secure openings for the good life, which is basically a right of all our citizens. When public libraries came into existence, the essential democratic and egalitarian argument for these new institutions was that it was impossible for any individual to buy all the books that they sought to read&mdash;all the information that they might need to participate in society on an equal footing with the better&hyphen;off in the Australian community.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to reflect on the lengths some people will go to to gain publicity for themselves. I want to highlight just how out of touch the Australian Labor Party is with the electorate of Bowman. Earlier this week I received a copy of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bayside Bulletin</EMPHASIS> , a local paper within my electorate. I was drawn to a story confirming that the boys club that makes up the ALP branch in Bowman had preselected&mdash;or recycled, more like it&mdash;the former Minister for Veterans' Affairs as the candidate for Bowman.</PARA></TALK.START>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="LLOYD" NAMEID="IK6">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not another recycled one.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XK6">Mrs WEST</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Another one. I also noted that the same previous member for Bowman was quoted on page 2 of Tuesday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS>  as agreeing to settle with AMP out of court a legal action relating to AMP's demutualisation. It seems that the previous member was representing his former adviser, Mr Greg Rudd. Actions speak louder than words, and the action taken by the previous member in dropping the AMP action after its timing brings the whole sorry saga into question. It was so well constructed that it could have been devastating for AMP policy holders.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">AMP spent millions of man&hyphen;hours and millions of dollars in identifying potential points of challenge to the demutualisation, so the challenge by Rudd and the previous member for Bowman was always on a hiding to nothing. If the action against AMP was not political grandstanding for profile, then call me a two&hyphen;headed banshee. The electorate is alert to these kinds of antics and the whole action was a political stunt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I quite agree with those in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> who considered the legal action absurd. Indeed, an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of Tuesday, 11 November boldly questioned whether the previous member for Bowman was in it for political gain. In the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10988"> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> on Tuesday, 11 November the previous member for Bowman even volunteered that he would be standing at the next election but the `court action had nothing to do with that.' What it did have to do with was answered in the article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 11 November where the previous member for Bowman said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If we fail, we fail, but in the meantime if nothing else we'll have stimulated debate.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Debate that would have required the previous member for Bowman to be out there doing the rounds of the media outlets. If the previous member for Bowman was not in it for political gain, perhaps Mr Rudd was looking for an alternative source of funding for the Queensland Ballet, which is suffering hard times.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to admit that it came as no surprise to me that a man&mdash;and, in particular, this previous member for Bowman, no less&mdash;was able to win preselection unopposed in the seat of Bowman. The ALP in the seat of Bowman is a boys club. Mr Sciacca is just one of the ALP lads who treat the women of the ALP with contempt. The other is that neanderthal on the subject of women entering politics, Mr Jim Elder, the Queensland Deputy Leader of the Opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I welcome the opportunity to tackle the previous member for Bowman again. He dismissed or underestimated me as a threat, because I was a woman. It is interesting to note that the previous member takes no responsibility for his own performance as a local member but seeks to blame his other colleagues and, by the sounds of it, Paul Keating for his loss. Take this comment from the article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bayside Bulletin</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe that the reasons people voted against my Party and myself at the last election are no longer there.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I make that point because this previous member enjoyed an eight per cent majority in the seat of Bowman. What is more, he was the representative in Bowman for nine years. What he is saying to the voters of Bowman is that they made a mistake, they did not mean to vote him out, and now he is giving them a second chance to vote him back in. The previous member has already started to take the voters of Bowman for granted.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Going back to the AMP issue, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS> article says that Mr Rudd agreed to a settlement out of court and signed a confidentiality agreement to prevent the settlement being made public.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in relation to a freedom of information request lodged to the Department of Transport and Regional Development by Mr Joe Edmonds of Glenview Road, Strathmore. In the department's response to Mr Edmonds, they have written back to him as `Mr Strathmore'. Joe Edmonds is indeed a man of considerable reputation and integrity within the Strathmore community and that description is not entirely inapt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Their response is to an application which he made for all reports and recommendations of the Department of Transport and Regional Development since 1 March 1996 concerning the future of Essendon Airport, including its continuation as an airport or its relocation or closure, and the operating and safety aspects of aviation activities at Essendon Airport and its financial viability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of documents were released to Mr Edmonds, but a number of documents were withheld from him and a number of other documents had parts of them deleted prior to release. Some of the documents that were withheld were draft cabinet submissions on Essendon Airport. There were three of them which were exempt. The reasons given for considering these documents as exempt under section 36 were as follows:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10989">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Documents in question, draft Cabinet Submissions, were not lodged with Cabinet but were part of the Department's ongoing development of a position to put before the Minister and ultimately Cabinet. The documents deal with both the option of closure of the airport and the continuance of it as an aviation site. As the documents were never finalised for consideration by key decision makers they contain information which reflects initial policy consideration only, and do not convey the complete picture in relation to the future viability of Essendon Airport. As such they could jeopardise the current sale process involving Essendon Airport and convey a misleading picture of the government's deliberations.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I am absolutely sure that the problem is not that they may convey a misleading picture of the government's deliberations but that they would convey the real picture of the government's deliberations concerning Essendon Airport's future as an aviation site. That is the reason why they have been withheld from Mr Edmonds&mdash;not because they might convey a misleading picture but that they might indicate to Mr Edmonds and to the prospective bidders for Essendon Airport the real situation concerning the airport and its financial viability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One really does have to ask how much deception is going on in Canberra regarding the proposed sale of Essendon airport. What the department has released is a briefing paper for potential bidders&mdash;or at least this paper comes from the Office of Asset Sales&mdash;in conjunction with a ministerial media release which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . on total revenue of $3.5 million in 1996&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is to say, 1995&hyphen;96&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Airport turned a profit of $772,000 making it the most profitable of the general aviation airports.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Nothing could be further from the truth. The Federal Airports Corporation's annual report for 1995-96 containing the audited financial statements for airports shows, on page 35, that Essendon Airport made a loss on that revenue of $1.114 million in 1995-96, making it the most unprofitable general aviation airport in Australia in line with its previous annual losses. The Auditor-General's verification is contained on page 65.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The deception in the briefing paper is outrageous. The same briefing paper states 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that Essendon Airport's main terminal is open 24 hours a day. What it does not say is that the control tower is not. It is closed from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m., and there is a jet curfew during that period. The paper also fails to mention that there is no longer any fire and emergency service at the airport. It also claims that Essendon Airport provides direct employment on site for over 1,300 people&mdash;again false. The consultant's survey of businesses operating at the airport showed a maximum employment of 750, which has since declined further due to relocations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This release of misleading information to bidders is deplorable, and the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Vaile) ought to take responsibility for such misinformation. He ought to provide an explanation to the House. Bidders ought to be told the truth about Essendon Airport's financial viability and not be hoodwinked by this deceptive bidding process coupled with the refusal to release documents that it would be in the public interest for people to be aware of.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="10989"><TITLE>Cooked Chicken Meat</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Monday evening in this House, the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) again sought to play the kind of politics he likes best&mdash;that is, of course, the politics of personality and the politics of the lowest common denominator. It is all self&hyphen;styled and pulled straight out of the New South Wales Right's manual for Labor parliamentarians, no doubt still self&hyphen;titled `Whatever it takes'. The issue was his attempt&mdash;by any method, by whatever it takes&mdash;to denigrate all my concerted actions in helping secure an exotic disease free future for the Australian chicken industry, and most critically the Hunter chicken industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question I have to ask the member for Hunter is: whilst he is saying the sky is about to fall in on the Hunter chicken industry since AQIS's announcement, why is the chicken industry seeing it 180 degrees the other way? The member for  Hunter even seems to have wanted to deny me the chance and the pleasure to have popped a bottle of champagne with local Hunter chicken growers last week over the news that no chicken imports would 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10990"> come to Australia from Thailand and that the trade protocol high jump bar for intended imports from the United States and Denmark is now so high that it makes such imports simply not a viable commercial venture. Thus, yet again, I am forced to debunk the usual aspersions from the usual suspects that make up the Hunter Labor political team who seem to so much more, day by day, hang on my every word and, indeed, my every action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rest assured, gentlemen, my productive activities in the Hunter are moving full steam ahead and have only just begun. From shipbuilding to saving chickens to pushing for a new mini stock exchange for the Hunter to give local companies access to equity financing and venture capital, the colour and movement is only going to get faster and faster.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Hunter, in preaching doom and gloom about the new protocols on chicken imports was quoted as saying in the Newcastle <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald</EMPHASIS> that the decision was `bad news'&mdash;and this is a ripper&mdash;and that it would lead to a `flood' of chicken imports. But he is dead wrong. At best, Minister Anderson indicated on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">John Laws</EMPHASIS> program that imports would be lucky to top one to 1&half; per cent of the entire Australian market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then on Monday in this House the member for Hunter said that I am misleading the people of the Hunter by saying that our supermarkets and sandwich shops will continue to a T to stock only Australian chickens under the new protocols. He is dead wrong yet again because industry experts see pet food and dried pet food, at best, as the only likely import product to ride on the back of the new groundbreaking and ultra&hyphen;strict proposals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A third little ditty is that the member for Hunter says that imports will now be coming in from Thailand. Strike three, member for Hunter. Under the stringent quarantine conditions that AQIS have announced, that presently is not possible. Just how stringent are these conditions? Under the old Keating Labor government, endorsed science from data produced by AQIS in May 1995 showed the timed cooking parameters for cooked chicken meat imports ranged from 70 degrees celsius 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> for 95 minutes to an incredible 80 degrees celsius for just 15 minutes. Under the new parameters, in the words of AQIS's executive director, Paul Hickey, this chicken will `have a charcoal look'&mdash;his words, not mine. The chicken meat will have to be cooked at a minimum temperature of 70 degrees celsius for 143 minutes or 80 degrees celsius for 114 minutes. That is a 99&hyphen;minute increase.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Hunter will probably now have the gall to say that that is still not good enough even though it was his mob that approved the old science, his mob that did not even bother to effectively scrutinise the old science, and his mob that only found a voice on the issue in the last six months. You are all frauds. But he should spare a thought or cast his eye to our close trading partners New Zealand, with whom we share common economic trading principles and very similar quarantine protocols. The timed cooking parameters for cooked chicken meat imports derived from Australia and the United States to New Zealand currently are: 70 degrees for 50 minutes; 80 degrees for nine minutes; and 100 degrees for at least a minute. Strike me down with a feather, member for Hunter, what does this tell you?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, the fight for strict quarantine and to stop all but a mere trickle of overcooked chicken products has been won. Secondly, Thailand has been restricted from importing cooked chicken meat into Australia. For the United States and Denmark, it is now a case of giving the game away thanks to these new protocols. I take no backward step in saying that my herculean fight to support this industry based on the science and not wishy&hyphen;washy politics has paid real dividends.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, what does the chicken industry have to say about all this? Garry Sansom, the national president of the Australian Chicken Growers Council, said in a press statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We welcome this decision which is based on sound scientific analysis by a world authority. It demonstrates how right we are and Federal MPs like Bob Baldwin were in arguing for tougher tests and importation conditions.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When we finally tabled this report of the Standing Committee on Primary Industries, Resources and Rural and Regional Affairs, I raised concerns about the amount of time that I had to speak, so this gives me an opportunity to say some of the things that I wanted to say on that occasion. The Auditor-General's report was taken on board by the committee to deal with some of the issues that the Auditor-General had raised. There was some controversy. A brochure produced from the Auditor-General's report certainly stimulated a debate about fishing management in Australia. Consequently, the committee picked up a brief from the Audit Office, as it is able to do under its statutory rights. It brought down a very substantial report for the future directions of fishing management in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite interesting to note that of the Auditor-General's recommendations, AFMA, the Australian Fisheries Management Authority, agreed with 27 of the recommendations, disagreed with 10 and had a mixed response to a further two. So a lot of opportunities came out of the Auditor-General's report, which was a plus to the Fisheries Management Authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One important issue that the management authority raised related to cost benefit and the need to look when you make recommendations at what they are going to cost. We certainly picked that up in recommendation No. 4 of our report. We recommended that the Audit Office be required to include in its reports an assessment of cost benefit implications. There were some other implications because of the criticism of the brochure, et cetera, that was brought down that we made recommendations on as well. Overall, from where it started, the committee was then able to work through various issues dealing with the industry and draw together a very good report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This area has a lot of issues in it that have to be dealt with by us as a nation. Fishing management in Australia is complex because we have all the state jurisdictions plus the Commonwealth jurisdictions. Some good work has been done over the years by people pulling together and making agreements on who looks after certain fisheries, because fish swim in and out of different areas and know no boundaries. That is working reasonably well, though there are still areas which need to be resolved so that decent management can be put in place. I think we urged in the report that some of those constitutional arrangements be made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the significant areas in our report related to the log books. Log books have been produced by fishers for many years. There is a need for faith between the management authorities and the fishers on log books. They are a real tool. What is being landed, what is being put into the log books, what is being caught and what the catches are should actually reflect the true situation. There is a variety of reasons why sometimes what is written in them is probably not what they claim to be.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10993">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report highlighted the fact that there is a significant lack of industry leadership at the national level, which certainly does not help getting a united industry profile so that governments can deal with some of these very complex issues such as managing fisheries, protecting fisheries and those sorts of things. We certainly recommend that something is done about that by the industry itself&mdash;by pulling itself together and creating a national body.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, I know you understand the timber industry because you have some in your electorate. The timber industry in this country was very diverse but did not have a national industry direction and ran into many issues dealing with conservation and other things. The fisheries will go down the same path if they do not pull themselves together into a national body which can then deal with some of those genuine issues of conservation and the enormously complex system of our seas and oceans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I noted that there were 33 previous reviews of fishing management in Australia. Our committee was quite courageous to take on another one. It was a very good process. There were isolated issues to be dealt with, especially in the South East Trawl Fishery mainly on the east coast of Australia and New South Wales where there were some long&hyphen;term issues under consideration. The government through its minister has done some other work on that to try and resolve some of those issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Overall, the evidence received was of a very high calibre. This goes back to leadership in industry. There were still a lot of people who gave evidence who were in cowboy mode and the title of our report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The last frontier</EMPHASIS>, matches that. People thought they could just pursue any course of action, as they have done in the past, in the way they fish and that that could continue. That is not going to be acceptable in the long term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The log books are dealt with in the report. One of issues with log books is by&hyphen;catch and this is a major issue that needs to be dealt with in the management of fisheries. By&hyphen;catch is where the catch is other than the target species. We had evidence that the by&hyphen;catch is being dumped back at sea without being landed. The difficulty with this is that it could happen because of the price of the species caught or because it was an illegal catch anyway and should not be caught.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of our recommendations in the report was that the by&hyphen;catch should be able to be brought ashore and that fishers should be paid an amount of money to cover their basic cost of going out and coming back and that anything left over from that should go to the research accounts. But at least that would result in a genuine, honest position of that by&hyphen;catch being recorded in the log books. Then we will have some scientific basis for making decisions about the amount of stock still in the sea.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those sorts of issues needed to be faced up to. The committee faced up to them and we dealt with them in our report in a way that perhaps some of the other 33 reviews did not. As we go on, I am sure that the minister, the government and governments in the future will be able to utilise it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recreational fishing was another issue that needed to be dealt with. The fishing management authority basically took the approach that recreational fishing was not within their area of responsibility and therefore never really took it into consideration when managing Australian fisheries. A lot of fish are taken out of the water, both around the coastline of Australia and out at sea, through recreational fishing. That should be taken into consideration when managing the fisheries of this country and we have recommended that that be the case. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10994">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very pleased that, in my own state of Tasmania, the recreational fishing body and the fishing council of Tasmania, the professional fishermen, have come together and are recommending `no go' areas around our coastlines. These are not so much national parks in the sea but areas which we set aside as `no go' for certain times, which may allow ecosystems and areas to build up stock and become stock bases which are non&hyphen;fishing from a commercial point of view and even from a recreational point of view. But we may be able to utilise areas where some fishing may take place at certain times&mdash;that sort of thing. I think this is a better way of trying to manage fishing than trying to prohibit people totally from going into some regions at all times and saying, `Here is a national park or a marine park and nobody can fish in that area ever again,' which could cause people not to support something we need to give support to to secure the fishing industry's long&hyphen;term future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Taking on board this and looking at recreational fishing, we also dealt with some of the commercial recreational fishing which the next speaker, the member for Paterson, Mr Baldwin, is a bit of an expert on, having some in his own region. He was able to give a lot of information to the committee in that regard and there were recommendations specifically dealing with that area. It is an area that is substantial in returning income to the country and to creating economic activity in some areas of the Australian coastline. The areas that came from the report were of great significance. The surrendering of the by&hyphen;catch division and the recommendations in that were also significant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was one other area that we dealt with which I would like to mention, and that is in relation to the CSIRO vessel the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Southern Surveyor</EMPHASIS>, which usually lies off the CSIRO ocean research area in Tasmania. I do not think she is used as much as she could be and it is incumbent on the research bodies to make sure that this boat, which has been built specifically for fishing research, is utilised much more than she is. A recommendation to that effect came out of the report. I think it goes again to the states not being able to coordinate themselves in their research areas, with levies coming from each state. There are areas where we double up, and we made recommendations on that to make sure that there is no doubling up in research and that the research has a focus. If the recommendations of the committee are taken into consideration, we will go down a better course than we did. That area needs to be given more consideration, not necessarily by government but by the research bodies involved in it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other area I would like to touch on is the by&hyphen;catch of birds and the good work done by Nigel Brothers, the wildlife officer from Tasmania, on albatross. That is of great concern to many people and it is an area that needs to be dealt with. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report tabled on 26 June 1997 was a report on the Australian Fisheries Management Authority by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Primary Industries, Resources and Rural and Regional Affairs and was entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Managing Commonwealth fisheries: the last frontier</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the limited time that we get to speak to this report, there is time for me to focus on only a couple of areas. One of those areas is game fishing. I have to say that during our inquiry I had great cooperation from my colleagues but perhaps they thought I went a little bit far in my dissenting report on billfish.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10995">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to look back to 1996 when in our campaign we said we would impose a mandatory ban on the taking of black and blue marlin by commercial operators if the existing voluntary bans did not work. I have to say that when I saw the front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph</EMPHASIS> on Friday, 4 July I was confronted with a headline which said `Fertiliser. That's what they made yesterday from our most famous fish.' In an article by Letitia Rowlands and Simon Benson they said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">They are the most magnificent of fish, growing to more than 4m and weighing 700kg, but these marlin were dumped on a Sydney loading dock yesterday&mdash;to be made into fertiliser and cat food.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The four tonnes of rare and protected marlin&mdash;an icon of both marine conservation and game fishing&mdash;were dumped at the Sydney Fish Markets at midday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The waste amounts to 115 carcasses of precious juvenile black and blue marlin, which had been rotting for more than 12 months in a cold store because they were impossible to sell.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As I have said, despite the voluntary bans on black and blue marlin it would appear that the six year old gentleman's agreement was not being observed. I do not think that there is any member in this House who would support the taking of fish that has no commercial viability. I surely do not and, after discussions with my colleagues on that committee, I know they do not support it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My dissenting report which I put forward to the committee went one step further. I do not believe in just banning the taking of black and blue marlin by commercial operators, I believe there is no need to take any billfish at all. Whilst there is a market for broadbill and a market for striped marlin, because those are actually quite good to eat, the reality is black and blue marlin cannot differentiate between the baits meant for striped marlin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most marlin are surface water feeders whereas tuna are deeper water feeders. By banning marlin captures altogether you will find that these long-liners will set their hooks&mdash;and it is a different style of hook if you are only going to target tuna&mdash;at deeper depths, getting them down quicker to avoid the albatrosses and surface fish that they are not targeting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that as we start to strip out these species of fish we affect one of the great industries that we have in Australia, the tourism industry. The tourism industry based on game fishing is worth millions of dollars to the Australian economy. It can be said that for each marlin taken in commercial fishing there is a potential $40,000 loss to the tourism industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my dissenting report I also recommended allowing recreational fishermen to be a part of the management authority to enable them to have direct input, even though they have that input now. However, the government is looking at charging them on a cost recovery basis. In the game fishing charter industry at the moment they are already paying a fair amount of tax, or more than a fair amount of tax. For example, they are paying sales tax on their charter boats whereas commercial fishermen do not, and they are paying excise on their diesel fuel whereas commercial fishermen do not. I think they are already contributing enough to our economy and there is no need for additional charges. Therefore, I disagree with some of the recommendations made by the committee</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The announcement by Senator Parer, Minister for Resources and Energy, on 5 November to protect black marlin and blue marlin by banning their capture is welcomed by all. In particular, it is welcomed by the Game Fishing Association of Australia. In their release of 5 November, Bob Lowe said that this, together with developing a Commonwealth by&hyphen;catch policy for commercial long&hyphen;liners in the wider voluntary ban area of area E will minimise the by&hyphen;catch of black marlin and blue marlin and support the efforts to protect sustainability in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10996"> area E. The release also states that, by protecting the fisheries, we have long&hyphen;term tourist industry development. Further, a report by the Australian Fishing Tackle Association, AFTA, stated that every marlin caught off Cairns injects some $40,000 worth of tourism money into the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we should not be thinking about these fish that are being caught as being caught and killed. The majority of game fish in Australia, and particularly billfish, are tagged and released by the game fishing associations. In light of our report, the Game Fishing Association has decided to raise the minimum weight for marlin captures from 60 kilograms to 80 kilograms, with still no size restriction for tag and release. One of the beaut aspects of tag and release is that it provides ongoing research and information for these billfish developments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Area E has been important to the fisheries, as it is recognised as being one of the greatest spawning grounds. For marlin, it was back in 1990 that ETUMAC initially recommended a ban on all fishing in area E. That was not adhered to and fishing licences were issued, but through negotiation and discussion the fishing industry, together with the recreational fishing industry, has set up a six&hyphen;point agreement on allowing fishing in area E off Cairns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That six&hyphen;point agreement recognises that commercial operators do have a legitimate right to fish in the area, but it sets out a number of agreed restrictions, including the non&hyphen;retention of all billfish except marlin broadbill, which is caught in totally different areas and depths from that of striped, black, blue marlin or short&hyphen;billed spearfish types of game fish. It is to be highly commended when people can sit down and work through the processes and the problems to deliver long&hyphen;term solutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From the outset, I also need to declare that I do have a pecuniary interest in game fishing. I am a very avid fisherman, and one of my marlin captures is now mounted on the wall of my office in parliament house because it reflects the spirit of my area of Port Stephens, which is second to and sometimes even greater in catch capacity than Cairns in billfish. It has long been recognised as being one of the homes of game fishing in Australia. Last year in our four&hyphen;day competition 1,032 marlin were caught but, more importantly, tagged and released to go back into the ocean to continue their cycles of growth  and spawning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fisheries management in Australia over the years has not exactly been something that we can be proud of. We need only to have a look at the gemfish problem that we had in Australia. Gemfish catches were allowed for many years when this new fishery was found until they were wiped out to all but extinction. Over the last four years, whilst there has been a ban on gemfish, the numbers have grown, and I understand that this year we have allowed a catch of some 1,200 tonnes for this season. The fishery will regrow but, with the lack of understanding, it was not realised that this fish is around about 80 to 100 years old before it is mature enough to catch it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also need to look at the future of all fisheries. I found an interesting article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Times</EMPHASIS> of 28 October last year when I was travelling to the South Pacific Conference with colleagues to look at the fisheries and timber industries and effects upon them in the Pacific. This article talked in part about factory trawl ships. These are ships that put out over a kilometre of purse seine net, and in one haul they can haul in some 400 tonnes of fish every couple of hours. One does not have to be Einstein to work out that, if you are pulling out that much fish, it is fish that does not proceed along through the migratory track to breed and provide long&hyphen;term fisheries.`</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10997">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These trawlers are over 100 metres in length, with as many as 100 crew on board. Whilst there is a desperate need in this world to provide food for all&mdash;and fish is the staple diet of many people&mdash;we also need to make sure that the industry is long term and is sustainable. I understand from this article that the worldwide catch was something like 20 million tonnes a year in 1950, but it hit 86 million tonnes in 1989. I do not know what the total allowable catch per annum should be, but anyone giving an indication can only be guessing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With cattle, sheep or other animals on the land, one can put them in a pen or mark off an area and then work out how many there are, but highly migratory species of fish cannot be seen from the air or penned up and counted so, at best, we can only guess the numbers. One of the ways that we guess is based on the amount of catch each year. Another factor that needs to be considered in terms of the long&hyphen;term sustainability of fishing is the effect the El Nino effect will have on the ocean currents and tides, and where we go in that direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> of 2 June 1997, Ian Verrender spelt out quite clearly the failed management of the eastern gemfish fisheries. The eastern gemfish was considered to be extinct four years ago but now, as I said, they are allowing 1,200 tonnes of gemfish to be caught this year. It was a very popular fishery in the 1970s, which peaked at more than 5,000 tonnes in 1978 but, within five years, half of that amount was caught and, in 1993, a total ban was introduced. We need to have respect for our fisheries and their long&hyphen;term viability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other fishery that concerns me is the southern bluefin tuna fishery. One of the things I fear is factory trawl ships coming in and depleting whole schools of these fish without leaving breeding stocks. For a fee of some $3.4 million, the Japanese are allowed to trawl 10,000 kilometres of fishing line, seven days a week, for a quota of 200 tonnes of southern bluefin tuna and an unlimited target catch of other species. The report highlighted that one of the main problems in the fisheries industry is the by&hyphen;catch. When factory trawl ships pull up 400 tonnes, generally around 25 per cent is by&hyphen;catch, so with each trawl we are looking at 100 tonnes&mdash;not 100 kilograms, not 1,000 kilograms, but 100 tonnes&mdash;of fish being dumped back into the sea.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be very naive to believe that the by&hyphen;catch just swims off and goes on with its breeding cycle. What happens is that they die. As they bring the fish up, the air bladder expands and the fish are not able to go back down, or they are crushed and they suffocate because of a lack of water and oxygen, so they drift back down to the bottom and become food for other fish in the ocean, or the birds pick them up on the surface.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is no different with the prawn trawl that we have in the Northern Territory. The by&hyphen;catch there of little dollar fish and others is just disposed of over the side, and that is a waste. We need to look at what we do with those fisheries. One of the interesting recommendations in the report was that all by&hyphen;catch should be allowed to be sold, whether or not it is commercially viable. Even if the fish is made into fertiliser, a percentage of the money from that catch could go into research in areas such as by&hyphen;catch prevention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also interesting to note that our prawns cannot be exported to the United States. Even with the advertising campaign of `Throw another shrimp on the barbie', they cannot use Australian prawns. The reason is quite simple. Because we do not have by&hyphen;catch excluders to stop the pick&hyphen;up of turtles, the Americans will not allow our prawns in. That issue needs to be addressed and it needs to be worked out, because the market for fine prawns in America would drive the dollar for them up higher, and that would make the industry far more viable. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10998"> We need to think to the future. We need to think about long&hyphen;term sustainability and the effects of market pressures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the other fisheries that worries me is the southern bluefin tuna fishery. In 1982, we took some 21,500 tonnes. That had diminished by 1996 to a catch of 5,100 tonnes. That is a decline of some 75 per cent. I would hate to see this fishery go the way of the gemfish fishery. We need to observe it, we need to look at the report, and we need to act on it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a lot of elements of the report of the Primary Industries, Resources and Rural and Regional Affairs Committee which are important and need to be addressed, but I must say that I was disappointed in a number of the very important areas that do need to be addressed that were not addressed. The biggest fishery in Australia money&hyphen;wise and the one that is far and away of the greatest benefit to Australia is the Gulf Barramundi Restocking Association. It is a number of years ago now that I did the figures, but some $270 million worth of prawns were caught out of that area alone. That was the figure that was quoted at the time. I must apologise to the House for not having been able to verify and update that figure, but I think you will find that it is roughly correct.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This most important fishery in Australia is not really addressed very much in the report at all. It is vitally important because we have had barramundi closures of the season, and we have done a whole range of things to protect the prawn fishery in the gulf as well. The assistance being given now by government is almost negligible. We had a fully operational research station at Karumba, but now there is virtually no government input into Karumba at all. For a country that is going to look after and husband properly its resources, to have no research taking place whatsoever&mdash;and I would argue that that is effectively correct&mdash;is a very great disappointment to everyone associated with this huge industry in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people of Karumba have acted themselves. I think it is one of the most important initiatives taken in Australia, and I say that with forethought. Where they are taking some 100,000 barramundi a year out of the gulf fishery&mdash;namely, through the three main rivers running into the southern Queensland part of the Gulf of Carpentaria&mdash;they have started a barramundi breeding farm at Karumba. I must single out and pay very great tribute to Robert McKinlay, Steve Emery, Rod Garett, Eric Lollo, Ricky Gunn and to all of Robert McKinlay's executive members who, out of their own money and their own energies, put together the barramundi farm at Karumba.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What they are doing there is putting 100,000 fingerling barramundi into the Norman River and 100,000 fingerling barramundi into the Albert River, which service the southern Queensland part of the Gulf of Carpentaria. The fishermen are taking out 100,000 barramundi a year. Because of the natural attrition of that 100,000 that go into the upper reaches of those three rivers and slowly swim downstream, a lot of them will be lost, eaten by other fish and die from natural causes on the way down. So we feel that we are now achieving a balance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make the point that the land based fishermen are only taking barramundi. There is none of the by&hyphen;catch that was spoken of by the previous speaker, the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin). That does not exist with land based barramundi fishermen. So we are no longer quarrying the resource but we are now husbanding the resource and bringing nature into a balance with that part of nature, homo sapiens, that has been taking an undue toll on that resource up to date. So we would think that the Karumba project undertaken by the initiative of the fishermen themselves has been a magnificent project. I cannot praise too highly the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10999"> work done by Robert McKinlay and the executive up there who have got this huge project going.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apart from anything else, it is very interesting to go there because they put glass windows in the big tanks. The huge barramundi will come up and have a look at you through the glass and, of course, you will have a look at them as well. They give you the opportunity to feed the barramundi. Of course, it is a terrifying experience because they snap very aggressively at your fingers when you feed them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said all that, it gives me no joy to say that, where the government of Australia was paying people to work, we now have launched upon a policy of paying people not to work. The three workers there were on one of these government work for the dole schemes. They were very happy to go along. They were getting an extra $30 or $40 a week and leading very rewarding, contributing lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By cutting the employment of these people, what do we do? We go back to quarrying the resource. We have three people now on the unemployment rolls that have nothing to do and are bored silly. This morning the national news was talking about suicide rates among young men and murder rates. Almost invariably people who were unemployed were represented in the murder rates in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have put three people back on the unemployment rolls. The scheme may fall over. I do not think it will, but there is a possibility it might because they have to find three wages to keep the project going. We asked the government for a tiny bit of money for some capital equipment, because the fishermen themselves are not rich people and they put out a huge amount of money personally, to expand the farm so we could produce a few extra barramundi, which would give us a cash flow that would enable us to make a profit and keep the project going and pay the three wages that needed to be paid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only did the government close down the project, because the work for the dole scheme was closed down, but in addition to that, we now pay these people the same amount of money. We pay them not to work, instead of paying them to work. Not only do we have a real possibility&mdash;not probability, I hope&mdash;of losing the scheme, but also three extra people are now sitting around with nothing to do. They are bored and living very unfulfilling lives. We are going back, if the scheme falls over, to quarrying instead of husbanding the resource as we have been doing for the last two years now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I tell you this to tell you a really wonderful story, but a story that maybe will not have a happy ending. It will not have a happy ending due to, as far as I can see, the nearsightedness of government decision making down here in Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to move on. One of the greatest opportunities this country has for creating enormous wealth is in fish and prawn farming. To put this into perspective, when I served as northern development minister in the government of Queensland in 1984, Dr Joseph Baker, who was head of the Institute of Marine Science, absolutely insisted that this government had to get into prawn and fish farming. Whether he was doing that to relieve the pressure upon the natural resources of the ocean or because, as he argued very stridently, his country needed the income, both those things were conditioning his determination to see this industry open up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I pay a very great tribute to Dr Joseph Baker, who was appointed to head up Landcare Australia, after he finished up at the Institute of Marine Science. I was very deeply regretful that his time came to an end at Landcare. As a result of his representations to us, we went 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11000"> out and looked for a prawn or fish farm in Australia. The year must have been 1984. In the whole of Australia, we could not find a single prawn or fish farm.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We located one that had gone broke on the wharf in Cairns. It was a pretty primitive sort of an operation. Two little kids' swimming pools were basically all that was there. The gentlemen concerned said he had been bankrupted and released a string of obscenities at both the state and federal governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, after many difficulties and very great cooperation by the then premier, Joh Bjelke&hyphen;Petersen, we got the show on the road. We are probably now producing about $200 million in prawn and fish farming in Queensland. Tasmania has been a marvellous success story in this area. Other parts of Australia have got into the game as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where we had been expecting to be doing about $200 million in prawn farming alone in Queensland by 1995, I very much doubt that by 1998 we will even hit $60 million. The reason is that the Greens and the environmental movement have managed to close more farms than we have been able to open. The existing farms have increased production dramatically, and I pay very great tribute to Ervin Vidor, the Sydney builder and construction engineer: Ervin has been a great pioneer, and his farm will now be turning over about $25 million. It is one of the ones that has greatly expanded production, and Ervin has been very much hands on in the whole project. He took 12 years of losses before he turned a profit, and so he is a great Australian who has made a very great contribution to his country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To put Australia's achievements in this area into perspective, North Queensland&mdash;not all of Queensland, but North Queensland alone&mdash;has a coastline 10 times greater than that of Thailand. Thailand makes $2.2 thousand million per year in prawn production. As I said previously, we are not even producing $70 million worth of prawn and, in fact, the number of prawn farms operating is going down and not up; and that is a reflection of where Australia is at and of where we are going, and of where other countries are going.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would say that, at the very least because we have extremely clean water&mdash;in fact, except for the coastal belt between Cairns and Townsville, there is hardly any intensive farming taking place along the whole coastline of North Queensland, which is something of the order of 2,000 or 3,000 kilometres long&mdash;and because we have the right water temperature, we have absolutely everything that we need for these industries to take place. But they are not taking place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say that native title claims are also playing a very significant role in this. The nature of land ownership by the Aboriginal people of Australia is that they cannot own land but must have some sort of mickey mouse, half&hyphen;feudal, half&hyphen;communist arrangement that has been imposed upon them against their will. If they were able to own that land privately as freehold title, in the same way that everyone else on earth is able to own it, I am sure that this industry would be exploding throughout all of those areas. In fact, the government operation, the crocodile farm at Edward River, was, when I was minister, arguably the biggest crocodile farm in the entire world and was certainly one of the most successful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, in the short time that is left to me, the report by GBRMPA on the question of dugong in Queensland, which again is not addressed in this report, is a very shabby document indeed. It is indeed a shabby document because&mdash;as I heard six members of parliament, including yourself, Madam Deputy Speaker Kelly, get up in one of the halls of power and say&mdash;there is no scientific evidence in this document whatsoever. It reads more like a little pamphlet that you would expect from an undergraduate conservation group at a university: 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11001"> a totally emotional document without any substance behind it. In fact, it is positively&mdash;and I cannot but use the word&mdash;deceitful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me back up that claim. The document says that dugong numbers have dropped clean in half in the state of Queensland; and then, to substantiate that claim, they use the numbers from the southern half of Queensland and not from the northern half of Queensland. But the vast bulk of dugong is in fact in the Torres Strait, and the numbers in the Torres Strait have doubled. All that happened was that there was a series of droughts, and the dugong moved north.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dugong have been proven in scientific studies on many occasions to travel 500 or 600 kilometres: one tagged dugong from North Queensland ended up a stone's throw from Sydney. They can travel very great distances. Like every other animal, when they lose their habitat, they move somewhere else where the grass is greener&mdash;or where at least the grass exists. What happened was that the dugong living in Southern Queensland&mdash;like the rest of Australia&mdash;simply showed their enlightenment by moving to Northern Queensland. So the dugong numbers moved north&mdash;in this case, to the northern half of the coastline of Queensland. But that was not brought out in the report at all. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suggest that I won a victory here on the point of order. I only hope that I am as successful in debating the substance of indigenous issues as I have been in debating the procedural point before the House today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very ironic that this debate is taking place at a time when the government's legislation would seek to remove the right to negotiate, which would seek to extinguish native title rights in bucket loads, to quote the Leader of the National Party, the member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer), who spoke of `bucket loads of extinguishment'. It is a tragedy that that is the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also think it is unfortunate that of the gang of five or six who took the absolutely extremist position on the native title legislation in crossing the floor, three of those are members of this committee and they put their names to a committee report which says that they want a new deal and they want greater autonomy for Torres Strait Islanders. That hypocrisy does need to be exposed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was a very difficult inquiry and a difficult issue because, as with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander issues, there certainly are no simple solutions. When we travelled to the Torres Strait we looked at the massive problems of education, of health, of housing, and I do not doubt the sincerity of people on the committee. We might have had different views as to what the solutions were, but certainly all of us were concerned at lifting the human rights and the economic and social conditions of Torres Strait Islander populations that we visited, whether they be on the islands or on the mainland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the difficulties that we have had with this debate is that due to displacement, due to an economic imperative of Torres Strait Islanders to move from the islands, today there are only approximately 6,000 Torres Strait Islanders living in the island region&mdash;they make up about 80 per cent of the population&mdash;whereas there are 23,000 Torres Strait Islanders living on the mainland. So one of the difficulties that we had was coping with the different points of view from the Torres Strait Islander people themselves. Many of the people on the islands felt that they, and they alone, should determine the direction of policy for Torres Strait Islanders. Whereas, not surprisingly, the people on the mainland felt that they should have a big say in what occurred in their homelands. That was also a very understandable view.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11003">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I think the recommendation that the report comes up with strikes an appropriate balance. On the one hand, you have a recommendation for the creation of a new body, the Torres Strait regional assembly, with one representative from each island, and with greater representation, three, from Thursday Island and two from Horn and Prince of Wales. Such an organisation should receive, according to the recommendations, block funding from both the Commonwealth and Queensland governments and, after a few years of operation, should report back to those bodies to see how the new organisation is functioning in terms of political representation and also delivery of services to the Torres Strait Islander people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would be surprised if some on the mainland were not disappointed with this recommendation and by the fact that they will not be able to directly participate in the Torres Strait regional assembly. Nonetheless, I think there is no real alternative to put forward, except that they remain within the umbrella ATSIC organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was particularly concerned that when parliamentarians, or any other group of Australians, have a look at organisations from indigenous people we do not set the bar on the high jump higher than we do for ourselves. It seems to me that in some of the questioning that took place in some of the inquiries that is exactly what we were doing. It seems that there was much assumption that ATSIC was an organisation which did not act properly; but when put up with the facts of funding of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations through the ATSIC regional bodies, we received no real evidence at all that ATSIC funded the organisations anything other than properly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to refer to one of our first hearings which took place in Townsville. We received evidence from a Ms Duell, who stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We also looked at the funding issue, and as Jenny has just pointed out, 90 per cent of our organisations are incorporated as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations and they service those populations. When we looked at just Torres Strait Islander organisations and just Aboriginal organisations that were funded, we were able to demonstrate to Canberra that they were more than adequately funded. I will give you an example: last year out of non&hyphen;capital funding, $400,000 went to Torres Strait Islander organisations and only $20,000 to Aboriginal organisations.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think that the sort of questioning which took place and the assumptions that ATSIC is not a good organisation were inappropriate in this inquiry. It is true that many of the witnesses before the inquiry did not believe that all truth and light rested with ATSIC, that is not surprising. One of the difficulties Torres Strait Islanders have got is that they are a minority within a very small minority of the Australian population, and that puts them in a difficult position. I think ATSIC needs to ensure that they continue to deal appropriately with the concerns of Torres Strait Islanders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that some of the concerns raised by some of the committee members were not justified. I refer to a hearing, again in Townsville, where it was suggested that somehow Torres Strait Islanders were not represented properly. The member for Capricornia, Mr Marek, asked Mrs Pryor, who was a witness before the committee, some questions:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr MAREK</EMPHASIS> &mdash;So there are 13 Aboriginals and only seven Torres Strait islanders? Do they all have the same voting rights?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mrs Pryor</EMPHASIS> &mdash;Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr MAREK</EMPHASIS> &mdash;How can you say that it is fair and equitable representation? We are talking about a group of people here who want greater autonomy&mdash;that is understood. Therefore, it must come down to the fact that they are not getting fair and equitable representation. If they are not getting fair and equitable 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11004"> representation, it sounds as though some of the submissions they are putting forward are not getting up. Perhaps it is the fact that they do not have the same amount of voting rights.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mrs Pryor responded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But Mr Marek, there are seven regional councillors representing only one&hyphen;third of the population. So they do have equitable representation&mdash;in fact they are over&hyphen;represented for the per capita population</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was what we found in general. That was what we found when we went to Brisbane for the hearings and that was what we found when we went to Cairns for the hearings. We found that in general terms, as a democratic process, the ATSIC elections are extraordinarily successful in achieving a proportional representation outcome in which Torres Strait Islanders do have that direct representation, and I think that remains very important if they are going to have that say.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to conclude my comments by referring again to the Mabo decision of some years ago and the follow&hyphen;up decision on Wik and to say that I think it is a tragedy that we as a parliament can consider reports such as this and have a unanimous report come before the committee, because essentially it does not cost any money and essentially it is about politics more than economics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we are going to be fair dinkum about talking about the rights of indigenous Australians, and in particular Torres Strait Islanders, we do need to talk about those economic rights. They need to talk about fishing, gaining employment and giving them real autonomy over their local conditions. But whilst we continue to have a selfish government which is attempting to take away even the right to negotiate over native title, Torres Strait Islanders&mdash;and the indigenous community in general&mdash;will not take this report as seriously as they might, because that sort of hypocrisy stands out. That sort of hypocrisy sticks in the throat of every decent Australian who respects human rights and, in particular, the human rights of our original inhabitants&mdash;our indigenous peoples.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not want to enter into a debate along the lines that my friend the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese) has raised, but I do have to raise a couple of matters in response to what he said. With respect to him, what he has said is a typical `rhetoric without substance' phrase. That phrase was said to me by an Aboriginal gentleman who lived in Cairns. He said, `All of this stuff is rhetoric without substance.' Where does the substance come from?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recommend to the honourable member for Grayndler that he read the book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Past wrongs: future rights </EMPHASIS>by Michael Warby and then come back into the House and say that everything that he has said still stands. That book challenges the traditional thinking that has totally failed Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders. I will read the conclusion of that book because I think it is important to get this message through. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the early 1970s, the anti-discrimination model and welfare models have dominated public discussion, and public policy, for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander issues. They are dangerous ways to present the issues because they focus overwhelming attention on what allegedly is or is not done to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, rather than on their cultural and institutional structures and skills and the incentives generated by public policy. While these models dominate public policy perspectives, policy will continue to be framed ultimately in terms of a passive role for indigenous Australians&mdash;with more power to anti-discrimination authorities, more expenditure on programs laboratory labelled "indigenous", despite the patent, and stubborn, lack of response of actual social outcomes to these approaches. Without a fundamental change in approach, the profound, though not unrelieved, failure of public policy in this area will continue. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11005">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Cultures&mdash;the knowledge, values and informal institutional structures transmitted across generations&mdash;have consequences. Cultural content is not a matter of some lifestyle "taste sensation" where one can blithely choose combinations with no effect on basic social outcomes. They are matters which pertain directly to better or worse interaction to the world as it is. It is not possible to achieve industrial&hyphen;age life expectancies in an industrial&hyphen;age society with hunter&hyphen;gatherer notions of asset management, causality and nutrition. Similarly, it is not possible to achieve industrial&hyphen;age standards of living with hunter&hyphen;gatherer notions of asset management or social organisation. In particular, the choice of communal, inalienable title is the choice of poverty: as the experience of the command economies has shown very clearly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is not a matter of cultural obliteration, it is a matter of cultural adaptation and evolution sufficient to achieve the levels of life expectancy, health and standards of living that all agree are minimally acceptable levels of achievement for Australian citizens. This is a process that all cultures have had to go through to achieve (where they have) such standards&mdash;for example, freedom from endemic epidemics and high levels of infant mortality is an achievement less than two centuries old in European and European&hyphen;descended societies. Indeed, the current life expectancies of indigenous Australians are equivalent to those of the general Australian population in the 1880s and 1890s.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Aboriginal cultures were isolated for millennia from the developing knowledge, institutional development and understanding of other societies. The efforts, sacrifices, sufferings and achievements of generation after generation of the societies of Japan, Northwestern Europe and descendant societies and their adaptors have resulted in the achievement of unheralded mass prosperity and freedom. It is only if we understand the real basis for that success that we can see a way forward for those who do not yet fully share in it. Indigenous Australians cannot fully participate in that achievement unless they also adapt to those understandings and institutional achievements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The developing thread in public policy of building up an independent, privately owned asset base for indigenous Australians is far more potentially productive than the previous welfarist and anti-discrimination approaches. But only provided such an approach is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> a basis for building up institutions, and assisting in the reconstruction of a vibrant civil society, genuinely inclusive of indigenous Australians; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> fostering the cultural adaptation which must occur if indigenous Australians are to gain rightful benefits of participation in Australian and global society.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Cultural (including institutional) adaptations must come from within indigenous societies and communities if they are to succeed. Forced persistence with, for example, communal and inalienable title is not only a basis for progress in improving conditions for indigenous Australians, it will actually retard progress.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It continues, and I wish people would listen to this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Native title, construed as communal, inalienable and generally partial title, is not the path forward.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That public policy should be based on the principle that race should not matter, except when it does, is a contradiction that cannot stand. It is too subtle a mix for the coarse operation of political processes; its intellectual incoherence not only ensures that it will not achieve its aims, but is a sign of deep lack of seriousness, of lack of genuine concern with consequences, with what actually occurs for real people with real lives to lead.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What policy had not done is to allow Aboriginal peoples to find their own paths to successful adaptation to the benefits and pressures of modern society. It may be that many will fail&mdash;achievement without the possibility of failure is an empty concept. Indigenous Australians do not start with an ideal set of cultural supports. But the consequences will be, as much as is practicable in a diverse society subject to the normal processes of happenstance, their own. Which is as it should be.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I find it very difficult to argue with that. I was not going to quote it in full, but, since the honourable member for Grayndler mentioned it, I believe it is necessary. I do recommend the book to people who should read it before they formulate views, which are based frequently on ideology rather than on looking to see how we are going to solve the real problem.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11006">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not criticise the member for Grayndler. In fact, I enjoyed very much going on that trip with him. He is a person with deep commitment to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people&mdash;I have no doubt about that. But let us not get bogged down in the ideology that somehow it is racist and speak of the right to negotiate as some sort of magic common law right. It is not a common law right. It is something that was put in a statute by the previous government and it has been used as a vehicle for extortion which will make very few very rich.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the problem. It will not help the people out at Cherbourg, the people I have worked with over 12 years, or the people in central Queensland at Woorabinda and at many other places around Australia. The great majority of the Aboriginal people in this country will get nothing from native title or the right to negotiate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Turning to the particular matter before the Committee, I felt very privileged to be a part of the inquiry and able to visit the Torres Strait and many islands first&hyphen;hand. Obviously, we did not get to visit the full extent of the islands, but we did visit a number of them and saw a number of things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first thing that struck me was that there was an incredible potential for ecotourism. I do not mean five&hyphen;star hotels springing up out of reclaimed land somewhere, but there is an enormously unused potential. I have a dream for the Islanders, if I can be so patronising as to say this. I want to see them have ultimate political autonomy, not from Australia but as part of a territory of Australia. That is what I believe they want. It is so important, in my view, to provide the paths to give them that. Because that is part of emancipating them from the welfare notion and directing them to the notion that once they build economic autonomy from that will flow political autonomy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that is possible. It is not going to happen tomorrow or next week. It will take time, but this report does provide a model or direction for that with the recommendation of the Torres Strait Regional Assembly. It is necessary for the Islanders&mdash;and they recognise this themselves&mdash;to get away from the handout or sit&hyphen;down&hyphen;money mentality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said in the House the other night, I met with Syd Kyle Little, who was a patrol officer in Arnhem Land for four years in the late 1940s. Talk about someone who knows Aboriginal people well! I am making the distinction between Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders, and it is important to do that. We cannot just lump them in together&mdash;that is something I learnt on the trip. We have to distinguish between the two groups, and within the Aboriginal group obviously there are many distinctions. He started Maningrida as a trading post, and it worked really well. The Aborigines would go out and hunt and they would trade. It worked very well until Mr Whitlam and Nugget Coombs came along and said, `From now on you are going to be paid to do nothing.' That was the end of Maningrida; that was the end of their lifestyle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One day it is going to happen that Aborigines will sue the government for doing that&mdash;that is what is going to happen next. That will be the next round of lawsuits following on from the separated children. It will be based on us having changed their lifestyle for the worse by our patronisation, instead of us looking at it realistically and looking at the Australian coast and saying, `Look at the potential for employment there.' We need people to be surveying our coasts. Syd Kyle Little made the suggestion to the then defence minister, Sir James Killen, that we could provide motor bikes. He made the suggestion that there was a real need to have 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11007"> people watching that coast, as there is in the Torres Strait. We should be employing Torres Strait Islanders and Aboriginal people in that respect. There is great potential there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was very disappointed to learn on the trip that though Torres Strait Islanders, as part of their natural culture, were market gardeners, there was virtually no evidence of it and yet the fertility of the islands is phenomenal. Then we were told by Queensland government officials, `We have a program up there. We have spent something like $5 million on a program.' I said to them, `Where is it? We saw absolutely no evidence of this.' They were astonished at this. I do not think it has ever been resolved in the material. I do not think we ever did get a resolution of it, but they were taken aback when I said that we saw no evidence of it. That is another example of one thing being said in Brisbane and another thing actually happening on the Islands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another lasting image for me was seeing, on Murray Island, an Aboriginal lady with a young child walking underneath a mango tree, both drinking cans of Coke. When a beautiful mango dropped down in front of them they walked straight past it. That is an absolute tragedy. We have to do something about that. But they have to do it too.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to provide training. It is important to do that if we are going to build some sort of economic base up there and assist the Islanders and encourage them, because they do a great job for Australia. They are the first line, as it were. Then there is the issue of illegal immigrants, as we found on Saibai recently. I thought Terry Waiai was a terrific bloke for the work he has done on Saibai as chairman there and so forth. We need to encourage the people to be paid to watch that. They need to be trained and to be engaged in watching our coastline to stop the spread of exotic diseases and to address the immigration factor as well. We have to be looking at that, and that gives them a base to work with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With tourism, there certainly does need to be training for the people. You cannot say, `Yes, we will have tourism,' and expect people to be going in there, untrained, to run it. Obviously they need to be trained and encouraged to take secondary schooling. And they have to come back. The Islanders who have gone to the mainland want to go back, but they have to send their children there and frequently their children do not come back because there is nothing in the way of employment to come back to. So the training is drained out of the island and it is left. Meanwhile we see all of this equipment lying around in a state of disrepair, and more money is spent on buying more equipment while the equipment remains unrepaired. But it is not spent on the training. That is an aspect that really needs consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The potential is there. When I broached this subject with the Islanders they welcomed it. They were keen on it. The Islanders did not like ATSIC, contrary to what the member for Grayndler said. My experience, universally, was that they did not like ATSIC. They would prefer direct funding, bypassing all of the dilutions that occur with the ATSIC models. I would support that totally. Obviously, there are very special cases there with their health problems. They need to get to doctors. They have distance problems. As mainlanders, we have to help in that respect. But the success also has to come from within. It will come from within but we have to encourage tourism and we have to encourage the economic base. From that will flow the political autonomy which will give these people a terrific vision for the future.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to make some comment on the report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Torres Strait Islanders: a new deal</EMPHASIS> , as presented by the chairman, the member for Indi (Mr Lieberman). I should say at the outset that my support for the 10-point plan of the Prime 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11008"> Minister (Mr Howard) is well documented and I support it because of the certainty that it will create for all Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to pick up the remarks made by the member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese). The member for Grayndler and I visited the Murray Islands, together with other members of the committee, on 23 October last year. The interesting thing, and the point that I picked up whilst we were there on the Murray Islands was that since the Eddie Mabo decision the people there really felt that they had been let down. Some time after the decision there was a feeling that they had no opportunity to claim land on their own islands. That was a problem and I found that astounding. I found that quite an unusual statement to be made by those people from the eastern islands, the Murray Islands as they are called.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) and the honourable member for Grayndler took time while we were there, because it was only an informal discussion, to visit Eddie Mabo's grave. I am sorry that I did not have the opportunity of getting there but we were busy talking to the people at the council.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In terms of autonomy, there are some parallels there with the Northern Territory because, while the Northern Territory was given some self-determination in 1974, it really was not until 1 July 1978 that more autonomy was bestowed upon the people of the Northern Territory by the Legislative Assembly. Some 20 years later the progress of the Northern Territory is seen to be amazing and today, in the tough economic climate that exists because of reasons known to us all, the territory's economy is on the move in terms of economic development, the pastoral industry and the tourist industry. The level of unemployment is the lowest in the nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Torres Strait over the past few years has been governed through Canberra and dictated to through Queensland, and there have been another 17 organisations in the Torres Strait with overlapping responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask honourable members to consider the report. Other members have already congratulated the committee secretariat and the people who participated by way of submissions. It was a very good exercise that gave the members of the committee a greater understanding of what the problems were, not only on the mainland for Torres Strait Islanders but also on the islands themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The submissions given to the committee made up the basis of the report&mdash;it is a very good report. On page 43, clause 3.26, under the heading `Improving service delivery', it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Torres Strait Islanders are critical that policies affecting the Torres Strait region are developed in Brisbane, Cairns or Canberra and have little relevance to the region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As one commented:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Torres Strait people are the best qualified ones to speak, as we know and experience the day to day problems inside the Torres Strait. Greater autonomy for the Torres Strait is quite simply a more effective structure in which to address the needs of our people.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think that sums it up, Madam Deputy Speaker. As I said, the Northern Territory was in much the same boat until 1978, because all the decisions that were being made for and on behalf of the Northern Territory were being made some 3,500 kilometres away. The proof of the pudding is that the Territory certainly has stood out since self&hyphen;government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One could imagine that, with more autonomy in the Torres Strait, the Torres Strait people would have a greater level of expectation for achievement. When you read the report and pick up different comments made by the people who provided submissions, there was confusion 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11009"> about where they should apply for levels of funding&mdash;whether it should be through ATSIC, the Commonwealth government or the Queensland government. So more autonomy and, as the report says, a new deal are obviously going to give the people of the Torres Strait better direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of the 25 recommendations in the report, I believe the two most important ones that should be considered relate to the next process of direction. Further discussion still needs to take place between the Commonwealth government and the Queensland government with regard to a process for more autonomy. I believe recommendations 24 and 25 for the way ahead place further emphasis on both governments to really get on with the job and not to let this report and its recommendations gather dust.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee put a lot of effort into the report, and people on both the mainland and the islands went to a lot of trouble to provide submissions to the committee. Recommendations 24 and 25 seem to emphasise the fact that the key to success in delivering benefits to Torres Strait Islanders is consultation and negotiation. Recommendation 24 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee recommends that the Commonwealth government facilitate a process of consultation with relevant State Ministers, Torres Strait Islanders and all other residents of the Torres Strait region to ensure their support before any legislation is introduced into the Commonwealth Parliament to amend the structures of government or administration in the Torres Strait region.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That recommendation itself could take as long as 12 months to get to the stage where legislation was even considered for introduction into the federal parliament. I believe it is very important&mdash;and very incumbent upon the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron)&mdash;to treat this particular recommendation as being as important as, if not more important than, preceding recommendation 23.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recommendation 23 deals with the mechanism of how more autonomy can be put in place for the Torres Strait Islanders, but recommendation 24 relates to a future process to ensure that all the people of the Torres Strait, whether they are based on the mainland or in the Torres Strait itself, have some say in the legislative process that is going to be put in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recommendation 25 is of a similar nature but is different. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee recommends that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) facilitate a process of consultation with Torres Strait Islanders living on the mainland before any changes are made to the ATSIC structure and arrangements for Torres Strait Islanders living on the mainland.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That process itself could take another six to 12 months. We need to put a mechanism in place through the minister to ensure that ATSIC proceeds to obtain the views of the people living on the mainland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As you move around the northern part of Australia, there is a train of thought from our Australian indigenous communities which says, `Why do we need the Torres Strait Islanders in our commission when they are really separated from the things that we do?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The same question is asked by the Torres Strait Islanders. They ask, `Why do we need to be involved with ATSIC and with the Australian Aboriginal indigenous community, when they are different from us?' That particular comment was highlighted on more than one occasion during the course of the inquiry. One could use some indigenous vernacular, but it would not be understood. The point simply is that Aboriginal people were saying that they should be separate and Torres Strait Islander people were saying that they should be separate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A new deal for the Torres Strait Islanders would certainly give them economic benefits. As the honourable member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith) said a few moments ago, the ecotourism 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11010"> potential of the region is outstanding. People in the tourism industry all over the world are looking for new locations that are relatively unspoilt. They do not want five&hyphen;star, 16&hyphen;storey hotel buildings. They are looking for reasonable, clean accommodation with reasonable transport, access and facilities. They would like to get into parts of the world that are relatively undisturbed. I believe that the Torres Strait area has great potential for ecotourism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we move to more autonomy for the Torres Strait Islanders, the Australian community must look at improving, increasing and better defining Australia's security. Many of the Torres Strait Islands abut the south coast of Papua New Guinea. I am told that, when the tide is out, people from Papua New Guinea can almost walk across the flat to Saibai Island, which is very close to New Guinea. Boigu Island, which is a bit further west, is even closer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee visited Saibai Island. I was worried that, without proper security precautions in place, it would be very difficult to police that region through quarantine and customs services. Any initial planning for more autonomy for the Torres Strait must include consideration of the future security of that region. It does not take much imagination to realise that all kinds of nasties could come to Australia because of that close proximity. Once they get to Saibai Island it is only a short trip to the mainland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As other members have done, I congratulate the secretariat for its hard work in providing the committee with the resources to take submissions throughout the Australian region. With the help of the secretariat, we visited all the Australian states, took submissions from Torres Strait Islanders&mdash;of which some 30,000&hyphen;odd live on the Australian continent&mdash;moved throughout the Torres Strait region, and eventually finalised the report which was tabled in this parliament in August.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The work has been done by the committee, the recommendations are in place, and they must now be evaluated and acted upon by the Commonwealth government, in association with the Queensland government. As the report says, a new deal for Torres Strait Islanders is important. We should move very quickly to implement the recommendations of the report and to give the Torres Strait Islanders a new deal to allow them the capacity to determine their own destiny and to coordinate the development of the region. All we need to do now is to let them get on with the job.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It certainly gives me great pleasure to rise on this occasion to speak on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs report on Torres Strait autonomy entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Torres Strait Islanders: a new deal</EMPHASIS> . The Torres Strait Islands themselves are entirely incorporated within my electorate. I have had the ongoing pleasure of spending a lot of time in the Torres Strait. I have had the pleasure and privilege of being associated with Torres Strait Island families since I was very young, particularly my Uncle Bobby and Aunty Aggi Ware and their children, Robert and Salma, and the late Benny Ware. In doing so, that opportunity has enabled me to very much understand a lot of the culture of the Torres Strait people and to appreciate that culture and to be very supportive of their views and their aspirations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the sad things that developed in our country was the grouping together of our indigenous peoples as one single group. Initially it was through Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs and now it is through ATSIC. I think it is unfortunate that we were not able to separate the two, given that the Aboriginal culture and the Aboriginal people are very different from those of the Torres Strait. I guess, if you wanted to draw comparisons, it would be very similar to suggesting that people of a white Australian background are similar to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11011"> Eskimos, for example. Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Island people are just totally different in their cultures, in their whole social structure and in the type of people they are. I think it is absolutely important for us to acknowledge that, and this is what this report is going to do. I believe it is the first step in the right direction in ensuring that they are afforded the recognition that they rightfully deserve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was very wide consultation throughout the Torres Strait and also on the mainland, given that populations of Torres Strait people have now spread quite significantly throughout the country. We have some 8,000 Torres Strait Islanders still living in their homelands but there are over 20,000 people of Torres Strait Island origin now living throughout mainland Australia. They are spread from Broome and Kununurra through to Perth, Adelaide, Sydney, Melbourne, Tasmania, Canberra and right up the east coast of Australia. So they are very broadly spread out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things that we found all the way through this process was that they were very much hanging on to their traditions and to their customs. They all had a very strong affiliation with their homelands. It was quite amazing. Interestingly enough, most of them that we spoke to still had very regular contact with people in the Torres Strait and, in fact, were able to associate themselves with particular islands and with particular communities. I think it was really good to see that they are able to maintain that strength of kinship within the Torres Strait community. It just goes to show the strength of the people and their determination to maintain their culture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things we found there was very significant numbers of levels of government, which meant that there was a lot of money going into the top bureaucratic end of the process. This tended to restrict the amount of money that came out towards the grassroots people. So one of our first recommendations was that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Commonwealth Government negotiate the establishment of a joint statutory agency (the `Torres Strait Regional Assembly') with the Queensland Government to represent all residents of the Torres Strait area and to replace the Island Coordinating Council, the Torres Strait Regional Authority and the Torres Shire Council.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The purpose behind this is to try to streamline the process and to maximise the opportunities for funding that goes into the area so that the people on the ground have a better access to a larger pool.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While it is very widely supported, there are some concerns with regard to the amalgamation of the Torres Shire Council. It is something that we need to look at in consultation with the Torres Strait people. One of the good things that has come out of this report is the fact that, all the way through, we have said that nothing will happen here unless there is broad consultation with the Torres Strait people and consensus. It is important that we get that support. There is no point in us, here in Canberra, imposing our views on these people. It is important that what we develop there is something that is totally supported by the Torres Strait people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I feel that there is still a bit of work to do in that area. There have been ongoing negotiations and consultations with the Torres Strait community. I am very confident that, at the end of the day, we are certainly going to be able to come up with a resolution to this situation that is going to be accepted by the entire community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the other good things that I see here&mdash;and again it is a way of recognising the Torres Strait people as a separate identity&mdash;is removing the funding from ATSIC so that the new 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11012"> assembly will be able to access funding directly from Canberra and set its own budgets rather than having to rely on being part of the ATSIC process. As I said earlier, this is a very important way of acknowledging the Torres Strait people as totally separate and masters of their own destiny.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One other very interesting thing that came out in the inquiry was the very strong desire by the Torres Strait people to remain as part of Australia. There was no suggestion from the great majority of people that there should be any separation. They are very proud Australians. This was clearly illustrated during the last world war when, with the formation of the Torres Strait First Light Infantry Battalion, almost every single able&hyphen;bodied man in the Torres Strait left his island community and enrolled. They spent the entire war in this regiment, for very little remuneration, and were totally committed to serving their country. I must say that it was very much at the expense of the communities that they left behind because only old people, women and children were left to fend for the communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that the Australian nation certainly owes a debt of gratitude to the commitment of these people. Sadly, there are very few of them left now as time is taking its toll. They certainly did a commendable job for this country. That is reflected now in their children in that they do not want to be separate from Australia but they do want the opportunity of being able to be identified as a truly different group of people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the other recommendations that I think were very appropriate were those relating to employment opportunities for our Torres Strait people. Recommendation 15 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Commonwealth agencies employ Torres Strait and Aboriginal residents in the Torres Strait region, develop cadetships and training programs for these employees with a goal of extending their representation to all levels and in all occupational groups within the agencies.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think that this recommendation is absolutely critical. For too long we have had a situation where they have basically brought in white experts from the mainland. They have had token islanders there with little training but certainly with a lot of commitment. Generally the whole thing has been run by people that have had very little association with, or knowledge of, Torres Strait.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is great to see these sorts of recommendations coming in whereby you are going to now be able to get Torres Strait people at all levels of the various agencies so that they will have maximum input and also have the same employment opportunities, the same promotion opportunities and the same training skills as those afforded to anybody else who wants to take a career in these particular agencies. This is a huge step forward in self&hyphen;determination for these people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recommendation 12 is that a portion of funding that was previously allocated to ATSIC is to be relocated to allow the Torres Strait Island fisheries training project to commence, and that the assembly should envisage the possibility of establishing joint ventures `to ensure that the three prawn fishing licenses allocated to the Torres Strait Islander and Aboriginal inhabitants in the Torres Strait can be used to the benefit of these people'. Torres Strait Islander people, as most would be aware, are sea people. The sea is very much part of their life, and it is important that they should be sharing in the resources and the opportunities in this area. This has been available for some time but, unfortunately, the funding has not been set aside to allow the training of these people to proceed so that they can take their place and harvest some of the benefits from the sea.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11013">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I see this as a very important recommendation that will certainly help to enhance their economic base, and also to develop further training skills for our Torres Strait Islander people in very much a culturally appropriate way, appreciating that over very many years there has been a very significant crayfish industry that has been almost exclusively manned by Torres Strait Islander people. We have had beche&hyphen;de&hyphen;mer; we have trochus; we have pearl shells. All of this has been done predominantly with Torres Strait Islander labour, and so it will be great to see that they will have now the opportunity of taking over some of these projects in their own right and becoming the entrepreneurs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the other things that we recommended was the upgrading of officers, such as monitoring officers, for the various communities. Involved in this are some 30&hyphen;odd monitoring officers at the moment, but they are only paid for working on a part&hyphen;time basis of one or two hours per day. They are involved in the various communities right at the front line of keeping an eye on immigration, quarantine and a whole range of other issues. It is important that these people be afforded the training and the upgrading of their skills that will allow them to be employed as full&hyphen;time responsible officers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen a lot of problems in recent times throughout the Torres Strait regarding illegal immigration and quarantine problems and also illicit drugs that have been travelling through there. To be able to really get a handle on this, we must continue to draw on the skills and local knowledge of the Torres Strait people and we should also give them the opportunity of having the appropriate skills to be actually driving this whole process rather than to be following along behind it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another thing too was appropriate, in that we looked very hard at the needs and the roles of the mainland people. It is very difficult to be able to tie them in to the Torres Strait Regional Authority as such, and so we felt it appropriate that the mainland people continue to be represented through ATSIC&mdash;although we have made recommendations that their representation be acknowledged further within the ATSIC bureaucracy and that there be specific Torres Strait liaison officers nominated in the various regions so that they have a better say. There will, of course, be a Torres Strait representative on the Torres Strait Assembly, and that will give the mainlanders a chance to have a say there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to congratulate the secretariat on its work. I think it has been outstanding. It certainly gave us an opportunity to be able to deliver what I believe to be a very good report. I would also like to commend the chairman of our committee, the member for Indi, Lou Lieberman, who has done a wonderful job. He certainly developed a very good understanding of the Torres Strait Islander people in the time that we were involved in this report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Through the good work of the secretariat, and of course the outstanding work of our chairman, we have been able to deliver something that has been accepted very much by the Torres Strait Islander people. I believe that this is the first step in a very bright and excellent future for our Torres Strait Islander Australians.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer to the government's foreign and trade policy paper <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">In the national interest</EMPHASIS> . This paper states that advancing the national interest of Australia and the Australian people is the primary goal. It states that the security of the Australian nation, jobs and standard of living of the Australian people are the paramount consideration in the formulation of policy. It also states that the only way to achieve these objectives is through more globalisation, more free trade and more foreign ownership.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report does not, however, define in explicit terms what national interest means, nor does it state in clear terms the impact that ever&hyphen;increasing globalisation will have on the average Australian. I suspect that the government has confused national interest with international interest. I will demonstrate that the government's policy to internationalise us is flawed and will destroy Australia and the lifestyle of the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia has endured 25 years of deregulation, economic rationalism and globalism. We have witnessed the disappearance of most of our Australian icons, we are seeing ever&hyphen;increasing foreign ownership of business and assets, and yet unemployment, debt, standard of living, happiness and peace of mind continue to deteriorate. We have been internationalised to a very large degree already, yet the problems are increasing, not diminishing. Does the government really expect Australians to believe more deregulation and selling more of our country will fix our problems?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More and more people are waking up and realising that the policies of free trade are helping other countries, not Australia. More and more Australians are seeing that the people they elected are working for the internationalists, not the Australian people. Successive Liberal and Labor governments, including this current group of treacherous self&hyphen;seekers, have worked for the interests of just about everyone except the Australian people who elected them and pay them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The United Nations, in particular, have been outrageously successful in having our government dance to their tune, which in turn is a death march for our own people and our Australian way of life. Certainly, around election time we see each of the parties selling their wares and sucking in voters with the lie of crumbs of short&hyphen;term relief, or making what is our right appear as if it is some magical policy they will bestow upon us like a gift, for which we should grovel and be thankful. But all of these things are just the deception of smoke and mirrors meant to hide the movement of the internationalists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those who believe globalisation will save us should just look at where it has taken us so far. We have 700,000 children living in families where neither parent has a job; 2&half; million people are either unemployed or underemployed, representing 27 per cent of the work force; 3.3 million full&hyphen;time jobs have disappeared, or more than one in two full&hyphen;time workers have been retrenched, in the last 12 years. Telstra plans to sack another 22,000 workers; the Commonwealth Public Service will sack 27,000 people next year; 60,000 jobs will be shed by the big four banks alone by 2005. The net growth of full&hyphen;time jobs in the 1990s has been zero.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only employment growth has been in part&hyphen;time and casual jobs, and those Australians lucky enough to have a full&hyphen;time job have to work longer and longer to keep their families' heads above water. The eight&hyphen;hour day is a thing of the past. Growth in low skilled and low paid part&hyphen;time and casual jobs is a worrying trend. It is not possible to raise a family or pay off a home on such an insecure and paltry income, and irregular and inconsistent work hours make family life very difficult. You can bet that sort of work would not be good enough for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11015"> the sons and daughters of our politicians and bureaucrats who are responsible for our national decline, but it is forced on the millions of ordinary Australians who elected these charlatans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By every measure which the average Australian can use to judge success, globalisation is a total disaster. These are the fruits of globalisation, and unless we rid ourselves of this cult&hyphen;like obsession with free trade, Australia will cease to exist as an independent sovereign nation. The greatest advocates of free trade in the world, besides the Australian government, are multinational companies. These companies can shift production from one country to another, exploiting the cheapest labour and paying the least tax possible, while charging as much as possible. For example, Nike makes shoes in overseas sweatshops, but Nike shoes are very expensive. This company exploits cheap overseas labour but does not pass the savings on to customers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Slashing the sugar tariff this year took millions of dollars out of canefarmers' pockets, and out of country Australia, and gave it to the beverage and confectionery industry, which is almost completely foreign owned. Have soft drink, chocolates or sweets come down in price? When Arnotts biscuits was bought out, US owned Campbells said they would employ thousands more people if they were allowed to take it over. The truth is they sacked thousands. Multinational Dupont was paid $60 million by the previous Labor government to remain in Australia, but they recently closed their factory, sacked 180 workers and kept the money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true that globalisation has increased Australian exports. But how much of these exports is produced by foreign owned companies and what benefit does Australia get from such foreign ownership? In the publication, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Trade liberalisation: opportunities for Australia</EMPHASIS>, published by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, companies promoted as Australian food producers are, in fact, foreign owned. Australian Meat Holdings is owned by the US giant, ConAgra. Kraft is not Australian owned, and Lactos is French. Other exporters called Australian, but which are in fact foreign owned or partly foreign owned, include Fasco Australia and Olex Cables.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The SPHC Group, which operates Parkroyal, Centra and Travelodge hotels, is foreign owned, as is Dreamworld. The company Bradmill is owned by Sara Lee. Yakka is partly owned by King Gee, which is foreign owned, and Gloweave has been forced overseas. The automotive industry is dominated by four multinationals, and Bosch and VDO are German owned. In fact, of the 40 or so companies cited by the government as successful exporters, around half are foreign owned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia has one of the highest levels of foreign ownership in the world. Estimates range from an ABS figure of 42 per cent of private corporate trading enterprises, to over 65 per cent of big business, which is an AusBuy estimate, and up to 90 per cent of Australian industry, which is the Austand estimate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have no easy way of knowing how much of Australia has been sold, nor of determining if individual companies are foreign owned, as the government does not release that information to the public. In 1986 it was possible to get the information from the ABS publication No. 5322, which provided a complete breakdown of foreign ownership and control of Australia's manufacturing industry. Why has it been discontinued?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If foreign ownership is so good why keep the Australian people in the dark about it? This extreme level of foreign ownership should be of great concern to all Australians. The end results are higher unemployment, profit shifting offshore and tax minimisation.</PARA>

As the Assistant Commissioner has not retracted his findings in light of the changes made by the federal government to attempt to stem this loss, I can only assume that this pathetic situation is still occurring.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this report the government enthusiastically advocates a reduced role for itself in the governing of Australia as we become internationalised. It suggests that as Australia merges into the world economy domestic and foreign policy will merge and democratically elected government will have less control of Australian affairs. This also means that the Australian people will have less say in how this country is run.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Is the role of government, as expressed in this white paper, to be no more than as manager or caretaker in residence working for foreign interests?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was appalled by the contribution just made by the honourable member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) on this paper on Australia's foreign and trade policy. Obviously the honourable member neither has read it nor knows the facts. When people deliberately mislead the Australian people, I regard it as a crime against Australia. She is walking out. She does not understand that she is promoting unemployment. She does not understand that the consequences of her policies and her attitudes are to belittle this nation at a time when there is an enormous future for it. Whatever her attitudes might be, I wish she could get her facts right. Reading inaccurate rhetoric here and taking it as gospel is not the way to help Australia through its present problems&mdash;and there are problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to get rid of unemployment. I do not want to have policies advocated by the honourable member for Oxley that are going to promote unemployment. I do not want to have Australia in a position where, again, we are going to go back into the world of the last century&mdash;and she does not seem to understand. For example, she talked about Australian ownership. I was very grateful to my colleague the member for Page (Mr Causley), who just gave me the figures given only a few weeks ago to the Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund. Less than three per cent of Australian land is owned by overseas interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In other words, she is looking at a number of companies that have been taken over. But she does not understand that  not one of us in this room&mdash;whether in the gallery or here&mdash;if we look back a few generations, would have been other than from outside Australia. Australia has been settled and developed by successive generations of people who have come and made their home here. Of course we have to have reconciliation with those who have been here in earlier migrations&mdash;some 50,000 years ago&mdash;but we have to look at the consequence of Australia remaining isolated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia is a small economy. Let me just give you one statistic&mdash;and I am sorry if the honourable member for Oxley is not prepared to listen to people. It concerns me that, when you try to put the position in perspective, she is not there. She picks her rhetoric, she picks her words, she picks her references, and most of them are wrong. If you go back to the general question of where and how we develop this country, we have to recognise that we have a population of about 18 million. Australia's 18 million people are in a region where those countries of ASEAN have a population of 400 million. Indonesia alone has 200 million people, and Indonesia is only a hop, step and jump from northern Australia. You cannot live in isolation and say that we are going to be forever able to look after ourselves. We are not able to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Look at the industries such as the wheat industry and the wool industry that those of us in the rural sector represent. We are producing about 80 per cent of the world's wool. We are 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11018"> not a major producer of wool, but we are a major exporter of wool. We are not like the United States, Europe or China. We do not have a domestic market that is sufficient to be able to consume the goods we produce. If we do not produce goods and sell goods overseas, Australia is going to be unable to maintain its living standards. If we look at a narrow base of overseas ownership, overseas investment and overseas trade, Australia is going to find that there will be more unemployment, not more employment; that there will be lower living standards, not better living standards. We will go into the future in a position where there are diabolic consequences for all of us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to go back. In fact, it had not been my intention to remark on the comments by the member for Oxley, but so many of them are wrong. She talks about the highest percentage of foreign ownership in the world. Those figures are wrong. She talks about the shifting of Australian ownership offshore. It is true that we are still a country in need of capital. Australia is a developing country. We are fortunate because we are also developed, but if our industries are going to develop we need to get funds from overseas. We do not have sufficient resources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last night, a few of my colleagues and I were talking with some people from Mount Isa Mines. If they are going to develop new mines here, they have to invest large sums of money&mdash;billions of dollars. If they invest those sums of money, they generate employment, both in the construction phase and in the operating stage, and they export minerals. The product of exporting minerals is that wealth comes back into Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Oxley made a great deal of the amount of money that is paid in taxes by overseas companies, but she did not understand that, although they may not be operating at a profit on their balance sheets, there are several ways in which companies are taxed. Firstly, they are taxed through their employees&mdash;and they employ many thousands of Australians. Secondly, they pay indirect taxes on fuel, sales and so on. Thirdly, their profits are assessed against the overall balance sheet of whichever country they come from. If it is felt that they are moving profits offshore, and those profits are consequently to be taxed in another country, they are assessed as being taxable in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It worries me greatly that there are so many errors in what the member for Oxley said. It relates very much to the policy statement made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer), <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">In the national interest</EMPHASIS>. Australia should recognise that we need to combine our relationship with other countries and our need for overseas investment with the requirement that we develop our resources in land, people, and minerals. If we can do that, we will have a partnership for the future. We cannot close the shutters and still operate as a viable nation in the way which most Australians would request. We have to be prepared to have investments from overseas and for Australia to play a part in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The two prime emphases within the paper <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">In the national interest</EMPHASIS>&mdash;and I think properly so&mdash;are on globalisation and the effect it is having on us, and the continuing economic rise of Asia. Why are they the most significant aspects of where we are going? If the honourable member for Oxley had said that she was worried about the Hollywoodisation of Australia, I would have agreed with her. In many ways, in a cultural sense, we are subject to too much of an impression from the dominant powers in the media world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regrettably, the images from the United States, and from Hollywood in particular, have tended to dominate the thinking of many of our young people in a social sense. That is not something over which anybody is able to exercise total control. Indeed, governments of both 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11019"> persuasions, through broadcasting and television policy, have introduced requirements about Australian content, the way in which Australian idiom is developed, and how we can present an Australian version of things. That really is what this is all about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, had the honourable member for Oxley read this white paper, she would have seen that, in paragraph 10, it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australians should have confidence in Australia's capacity to shape its future. Australia brings many economic, strategic and cultural strengths to the pursuit of its foreign and trade policy objectives.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Further on, in paragraph 14, it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Being confident about Australia's future does not mean being complacent. Australia cannot rest on its strengths.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I point out to the member for Oxley that there is nothing in this paper which says that domestic and foreign policy objectives are going to be merged. Today, we are all more aware of foreign policy issues. We realise that Australia cannot be an island unto itself. At a time of globalisation, we have to try to influence those in our region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of areas in which we can influence them. We can influence them by promoting economic growth in their countries. On other occasions, I have heard remarks made against Australian aid by the honourable member for Oxley. One of the reasons we have an aid program is to try to ensure economic and political stability. If there is economic growth and people see that they have a capacity within their country to achieve the same living standards as others, they are not going to fight wars. They are not going to fight with each other. They are going to be busy trying to improve their living standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, we have to try to promote democratic institutions. We are all concerned about the degree to which, in our region, there are a number of autocratic governments where, regrettably, patronage and corruption are endemic. We have to try to influence them away from that. One of the reasons why I strongly support financial help being given to Indonesia, to Thailand and, prospectively, to a number of other countries in the Asian region is that the IMF, which provides these packages, is setting down conditions of what we call good governance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While `good governance' might not necessarily be an ideal form of words, what it means is that you are promoting responsibility in government, where you can get rid of some of those elements of corruption, you can get rid of some of the elements of patronage, and you can promote the essence of democracy. The big advantage of democracy, for all the problems that are in it, is that it does allow for succession. I think we are all aware that there is concern about the succession in Indonesia and in a number of countries in our region. It is a product of a democratic process in the Philippines, but there is a worry about the capability and the characteristics of the next government in the Philippines. Even with a democracy, there is not a certainty of what the next government will do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The IMF conditions are setting down ground rules which, hopefully, help to get rid of those aspects of governance that Australia deplores in the countries in our region. Human rights are a very important product of it. The white paper is not saying that you do not worry about those things. What it is saying is that, if you act as a responsible citizen, you have a capacity to influence those countries in a way towards the practices which we in Australia believe most desirable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we do not do that, the downside is that we have an unstable region. We have a circumstance where, for years, Australia has had to defend other countries against what we saw as an encroachment on the principles to which we adhere. We do not want that in our 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11020"> part of the world. It is for that reason that I very strongly support what Australia is doing in Bougainville at the moment. It is a very difficult situation. It is a product of the foreign policy white paper objectives of being a good international citizen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second most profound influence on Australia that the white paper has identified is the continuing economic rise of Asia. Again, that is an aspect of the interrelationship between our economy and the world that is terribly important to us. People do not seem to understand that three-quarters of Australian exports&mdash;minerals, manufactured goods, agricultural produce&mdash;are sold into Asia. If we cannot maintain stability in that region, if we cannot encourage economic growth there, we are going to find that our exports are prejudiced. If we do not get that export income, we cannot fund infrastructure, we cannot fund schools, we cannot fund hospitals, and we cannot fund all the services that people rely on. The important part about being a good citizen internationally is not that you are just helping others but that you are helping yourself. That is really the basic philosophy of this report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we help others&mdash;if you can avoid the situation we had in World War II when Japan threatened us, if you can avoid the instability that emerged during the Malaysian campaign and the threats that many of us believed to be there during the war in South Vietnam&mdash;we are going to ensure that we have stability. We are not going to have our soldiers fighting overseas but we are going to have them serving on peacekeeping missions or on truce keeping missions, as is the purpose in Bougainville at the moment. We are going to have them serving in a way which prevents the threats to Australia. This document looks at both the economic side of things and the security side of things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wanted to briefly mention that in the time available to me because I think it has a few very important elements. It identifies that the government strategy for advancing Australia's security interests is a strong national defence capability. While I was minister for defence and in other roles I have taken over the years, I have always held that if you have a strong national defence capability it should be strong enough that you never have to use it. If you have a good defence capability&mdash;if it is strong enough, professional enough and technologically advanced enough&mdash;you never have to use that defence force. People know that, if they are going to attack you, they are going to suffer. That is one of the reasons I very strongly endorse the actions that the Howard government has taken to ensure that we do play a responsible role internationally in peacekeeping forces. We have done that, and we are doing that. I think it is very important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second government strategy in advancing Australia's security interests is the alliance relationship with the United States. The Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade had a two-day seminar recently on our ANZUS relationship. Some would say it is no longer relevant. The point about our relationship with the United States is that the United States is so dominant in world affairs, it is the only world superpower, and it is important we keep it interested in our region. It does not mean we are dependent on it, but it means we work with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can assure you that many ministers, including the present ones, do not necessarily come along and kowtow when America says they want to do something. In fact, we oppose them on many issues. We try and direct them to the way we would wish. But they are powerful allies and a very important factor in our region and, significantly, will be in the future. That is why I believe our ANZUS relationship is important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next priority relates to expanding Australia's bilateral, regional and multilateral security links. This government has done a wonderful job. For that reason and because the paper itself 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11021"> sets out a framework for identifying our priorities in foreign policy, this is a very commendable paper. I commend the government for having produced it. It does not answer all the problems. It is a moveable, flexible document and one which I strongly support.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was greatly interested in the speech by the member for New England (Mr Sinclair) because he encapsulated the position of the government on particularly its regional arrangements. He makes the observation on the two rescue operational packages&mdash;the first in Thailand and the second one for Indonesia&mdash;that those are in the national interest of Australia. I, for one, would like to know the details of our participation in them, as I have asked before, given that there are a number of other issues that relate very strongly to Australia's participation. There was no statement made by either the foreign minister or the Treasurer as to Australia's involvement, particularly in the Thai baht bail&hyphen;out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things that the right honourable member has said is that by being good citizens we can encourage stability and good relations within our region. The difficulty is that the economic crisis that has faced South&hyphen;East Asia, and now is facing North&hyphen;East Asia, is to some extent perhaps the consequence of Australia and other nations not taking a strident enough stance on corruption and some of the economic skewings in their own nations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For instance, one would have assumed that the elements that were responsible for the collapse of the Thai baht were well&hyphen;known to the people who are responsible for advising the government on affairs in Thailand, whether they are from the Australian embassy in Thailand or the Thai desk at the Department of Foreign Affairs. One would have assumed that these problems were sufficiently well&hyphen;known for Australia to have taken a more strident stance in relation to the problems of dealing with a nation with a thoroughly corrupt system, based as it was on a system of patronage. As we know now from the aftermath of the Thai baht bail&hyphen;out, when the finance companies that had participated in the real estate boom&mdash;particularly in the Thai capital&mdash;collapsed, many of the people in the cabinet or in the Prime Minister's own party were in the list of names associated with those finance companies that had fallen over, leading to a substantial conflict of interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The situation is that the countries in our region that have most benefited from the globalisation of the world economy are Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines and Indonesia. Yet, at the same time, the governments of those countries are very reluctant indeed to adopt what most would consider to be the basic tenets of globalised economies such as open trade and a hands&hyphen;off approach to the day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day running of the economy or the day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day market activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, we have seen in more recent times some quite extraordinary statements from the Prime Minister of Malaysia on the collapse of the ringgit and economic problems there. The statements, with the exception of one statement made by the Prime Minister while he was in the United Kingdom, in my view were not answered by our Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer). He in fact said that he had been persuaded by other leaders in the region to say nothing. I would have thought that the statements made by Prime Minister Mahathir, particularly in relation to what he considered to be a Jewish conspiracy to bring down his country's economy, were sufficiently bizarre to deserve a strident response.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The right honourable member for New England mentioned the 1930s and security problems then. Had, for instance, some of the leaders of nations in Europe during the 1930s taken a more strident approach to the problems that were being encountered by some of the citizens of Germany and other countries, they would probably have been able to avoid some of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11022"> consequences of the Second World War&mdash;a war that saw the deaths of a large number of people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a counterargument to the argument of the right honourable member for New England: yes, we should engage in the region and we should also encourage as much trade as possible with our neighbours. But, at the same time, we should not be put in the position where we are in essence appeasing some of the more unpleasant and, in some cases, unacceptable facets of the government policies of the countries that we are talking about. To expand on that a little in relation to Indonesia, from what is now an historical perspective, there are still very substantial problems in relation to East Timor and also, of course, to solving what is now less of a mystery and more of a straight allegation of murder with regard to the deaths of the Australian journalists in Balibo in 1975.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not sure there would be many countries around the world that would have taken such a tame stance, in my view, as Australia has done over the intervening period of time. I must say that the response of the Minister for Foreign Affairs to my question during the last session was extraordinary. He in effect said that, because the Indonesians have essentially said that the case is closed, we say the same.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here we are in a position where, presumably, the Australian government is now negotiating its role in an international bail&hyphen;out of the Indonesian economy. I would have thought that was precisely the time that Australia could use what would be an enhanced capacity to get concessions from the Indonesian government to find out exactly what happened: whether the allegations that those journalists were murdered by the Indonesian army are true; and, if they are true, whether the Indonesian government is going to do anything about bringing the people responsible to justice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also say that the whole of that period since 1975 and Australia's participation in it is a national disgrace. We have appeased the ruling regime in Indonesia at the cost of many lives of people who are East Timorese. One could say that that is not strictly an Australian problem; but, at the same time, Australia participates in a number of areas where it takes a view on human rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have thought that, given we have been strident in other places on human rights, it would be an easy thing for people to say to us, `Hang on a second! In your own backyard there has been wholesale murder of people in a way that is unacceptable for obvious reasons, but in a way that you have been almost prepared to tolerate, because of your lack of opposition or the failure to take sufficiently strident action to try to prevent these things from taking place any longer.' Not only have we allowed it to take place but we also financially contribute, and that is obviously another source of criticism for Australia where East Timor is an issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I might, I will dwell on another, perhaps more localised aspect in relation to the application of foreign policy; but firstly I would say it is good that we do actually have a written statement of Australia's foreign policy: it is the first time for a very long time that Australia has had a white paper on foreign policy.</PARA>

This government said that financial restraint prevents it from following that course at this time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand the need for fiscal responsibility but I emphasise that the government has certain obligations that it should meet in this matter. The three most important obligations are to the development and enhancement of trade with Croatia and throughout the region; to service provision for Croatians, many of whom have strong family and business links to Australia; and to the estimated 10,000 Australian citizens living in Croatia&mdash;and also, I might say, to people in Bosnia and Herzegovina who find it difficult to go to either Vienna or Belgrade to obtain adequate embassy services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that the message we now send, by virtue of the level of existing foreign mission representation, is that our relationship with Croatia&mdash;from which one of the largest ethnic communities in Australia is drawn&mdash;is not as important as our relationship with Nepal, Kazakhstan, or Trinidad and Tobago. If we have to have cutbacks, I would have thought of Trinidad and Tobago as being areas where we could cut back, surely&mdash;unless of course they are places where people like to go to work because they are such a wonderful part of the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not entirely sure why we need to have a mission in Nepal. I can understand the need for a presence in the central Asian republics; however, I am still not convinced the Kazakhstan mission is as important as having one in Zagreb, Croatia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am the chairman of the Australia&hyphen;Croatia parliamentary friendship group, but I have never made a secret of that. I am saying that, as far as our relationship with that country is concerned, I would have thought it was absolutely critical. We were, for instance, one of the first nations outside of the European Community to recognise the independence of Croatia and its declaration of sovereignty. Also, we are one of the few countries that have a large diaspora of former Croatian people and their descendants yet we do not have an embassy in Zagreb, in Croatia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People talk about eastern Europe, but in actual fact Croatia's position relates it to central Europe. Given the importance of central Europe, given the fact that the Adriatic is going to become a much more important area for trade with Europe, I would have thought that having an embassy in Zagreb is very important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those who have been to the region would know that Vienna is 400 kilometres away. It is a long way to go and it involves a fair amount of inconvenience. The consular days service that is provided in Zagreb is, in my view, insufficient. Ministers in the Croatian government 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11024"> have mentioned during discussions in recent times, in relation to visa applications, et cetera, that that has been a problem in the past.</PARA>

When I attended the Asia&hyphen;Pacific parliamentary forum in Vancouver in January, I was struck by the strong interest of South American countries, particularly Peru. It is not lost on them that this region has a large market demand. They can see opportunities for them to make inroads into the region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Countries like Peru and Brazil have, for instance, large Japanese communities; that gives them special relationships with Japan, the country with which we have the largest trading relationship in our region. So this, in my view, is critical. We often, perhaps, are more obsessed with other areas in the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region, but I point out the importance of Australia taking a much greater interest in the thrust of the South American nations into looking towards their west, into the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region, as opposed perhaps to looking eastwards towards Europe and Africa.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to reiterate the point I raised at the beginning, that there is, in my view, a very strong need for us to recognise the important role Australia can play in opposing the sorts of things that have distorted the economies in our region, provoking these most recent economic crises. We can say, I think in good faith, when we are dealing with our neighbours' leaders, that in the end the further globalisation of the world economy, and of the regional economies, is going to depend very strongly on those nations becoming as open and as little corrupt as possible. It seems to me to be self&hyphen;serving when we are, in essence, giving comfort to people who are operating corrupt and, in some instances, violent and discriminatory regimes, that we will continue trading under those circumstances without the changes becoming necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The right honourable member mentioned the IMF rescue package. My view is that had the Thai baht bailout not been promoted so strongly by Japan, which had the greatest interest in this&mdash;Japan is holding, I think, something like half of the Thai national debt&mdash;then possibly the bailout would not have occurred and we would not have seen any changes. Already we are seeing manifestations of the changes in Thailand appearing on the streets in Bangkok.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given the number of military governments that have occurred in Thailand since the 1930s&mdash;I think it is about the same number as the number of constitutions they have had&mdash;I would have thought that it may even be promoting instability by the rapid implementation of these changes, rather than a more gradual one, which might have been the case had Australia taken a much more strident position along with other nations in the first place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note that Dr Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of the United States, was reluctant to see the United States participate in that rescue. One of the reasons was because, as he said, they had insufficient economic data from which to make what he considered to be a rational decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe we are perhaps operating more smartly than Alan Greenspan because we are not even prepared to debate the issue in the parliament. Neither of the ministers responsible has made a statement in relation to the matter, and I think that is a disgrace. We were told that parliamentary standards were going to be raised. In the particular instance of the $1.4 billion that has been committed&mdash;whether or not it has actually been expended, it has been

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the second occasion this week that I have closely followed a speech by the honourable member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). I do not want to take up too much time in terms of the member for Oxley because, in my view, nationally she is irrelevant. But, that said, what she said here this morning when she used such words in relation to this white paper as `nonsensical' or `nonsense', when she used the word `treachery' and when she talked about death marches and international masters, emphasises to me&mdash;and I hope to the Australian population at large&mdash;that, first of all, she does not know what she is talking about in general and that, specifically in relation to this report, I doubt that she has even read the white paper.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That said, I support everything that the right honourable gentleman from New England (Mr Sinclair) had to say on this. I only wish that the media and other people would not generate stories in terms of the member for Oxley which bear little or no resemblance to the truth, because a lot of what she says is, quite candidly, untrue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is well aware of the need for Australia to consider how its national interests can be pursued in the long term. Last year it commissioned a white paper on foreign and trade policy, which is the first comprehensive vision statement on Australia's foreign affairs and trade. As tabled, it identifies Australia's long&hyphen;term interests, it examines the international environment in which Australia will pursue these interests in the future and it recommends appropriate strategies for their advancement. Again, as the right honourable gentleman from New England pointed out, not everything in this white paper should be regarded in a biblical sense. Nevertheless, it is a good start to outlining a strategy for the first time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say at the outset that the government sees Australia in the 21st century as a cooperative, economically competitive and secure nation, comprehensively engaged with the East Asian region, at the same time maintaining and developing links with countries beyond this region. We have paid particular attention to bilateral relationships because we take the view that multilateral institutions, whether regional or global, will always be far more effective if the countries within them have confident and strong bilateral ties. Australia's highest unambiguous foreign policy priority is, therefore, a closer engagement with Asia. Our determination to make this priority a practical reality was clear from our first day in office, in March last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has continually strengthened and revitalised Australia's bilateral relationships throughout the region in a comprehensive, practical and focused way. However, an Australia&hyphen;first policy does not mean Asia only. On the contrary, the Howard government understands that it is not enough to focus on our region alone. We realise that economic interests and our security can be tied up with events well beyond our immediate region and in which there are important historical and geographic dimensions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the very short time available to me today I want to explore briefly four important aspects of Australia's foreign policy and those are: Australia's commitment to the region; the enhancement of Australia's security, especially in the context of developments in the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region; Australia's broader global links; and, finally,  the government's principled approach to human rights and humanitarian issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Looking first at Australia's commitment to the region, our approach of making closer engagement with the region our highest foreign policy priority is not new with Australian 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11026"> governments from either side of the political fence acknowledging the centrality of Asia to Australia's national interest in the post World War II era. Dramatic economic and political change throughout east Asia over the past 10 to 15 years has made a strengthened Australian engagement with Asia even more imperative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Asia&hyphen;Pacific region demonstrably is the vital sphere of our economic and strategic interests with almost two-thirds of our exports going to APEC countries and a growing percentage of these in manufactured products and skilled services, with half of Australia's total foreign direct investment going to APEC countries, and with nine of our top 10 trading partners now located in that region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The defining dynamic continues to be strong economic growth. Despite what has happened in Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand over recent weeks, World Bank predictions have east Asia growing at over seven per cent a year to the year 2004, and that is 2&half; times faster than the rest of the world. By 2020, four of the world's 10 largest economies are likely to be in Asia&mdash;Japan, China, Korea and India. Indonesia could possibly be near the top in the next group of 10 countries, which might include Thailand, despite what has happened recently, and Australia. Over the same period Asia's share of the world gross domestic product will increase, possibly to about 35 per cent, up from about 28 per cent as it is now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For Australia the opportunities and challenge are therefore immense. Sustained growth in east Asia and the opportunities that it gives rise to will only be possible so long as the barriers to the movement of goods, of capital and of ideas, continue to fall, and so long as governments continue on the path of reform and deregulation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In meeting these challenges the government's overriding goal is to deliver practical outcomes. I believe we have made a very solid start and I want to outline some of the highlights. At the bilateral level we built on the important initial meeting with Dr Mahathir by delivering a new trade agreement with Malaysia last year. That agreement will bring, over time, greater access for Australian producers and benefits to Australian consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the Australia&hyphen;Indonesia Ministerial Forum in Jakarta last year, the Australia Indonesia Development Area, AIDA, was announced. This represents a significant milestone in our bilateral relationship with Indonesia. It is the first such subregional agreement between Australia and an ASEAN country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has also reached a historic maritime boundaries agreement of treaty status with Indonesia which concluded a quarter century process of negotiations. The result is that individuals and companies on both sides of the boundary will proceed with maritime activities on the seabed and in the water column with certainty and security. This was signed by our foreign minister and by Ali Alatas in Perth in March of this year. As chairman of the Joint Committee on Treaties I will be reporting on this treaty to parliament on Monday week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government signed a significant new trade agreement with Taiwan last year worth $30 million in overall terms across the spectrum of Australian exports. The government also concluded a single aviation market arrangement with New Zealand, overturning the damage&mdash;and it was damage&mdash;caused by the previous government's unilateral repudiation of that agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also been working closely with the PNG government as recently as the last few days to ensure that Australia's aid program increasingly delivers real benefits for the people of that country and to encourage PNG, in the medium to longer term, to meet the criteria of the World Bank and IMF programs.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11027">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of Australia's security, the second fundamental aspect of this government's foreign policy, we have taken steps to improve Australia's security and the strategic environment in which we pursue our interests. We have specifically set out to help in the development of a regional security environment which forestalls resort to force in international disputes, which prevents proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and which encourages cooperation to enhance the security of the region as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the bilateral level, there is a growing acceptance that strong, confident relationships provide the underpinning for regional stability and effective multilateral activity. Australia has been doing this through practical bilateralism in the Asia&hyphen;Pacific area and, as the right honourable member for New England said, the government sees its alliance with the United States in that same light. Indeed, the US presence in the Asia&hyphen;Pacific and its alliances with key partners are major elements of the region's current stability. In addition to these linkages based on formal arrangements, Australia has a range of other strong and growing bilateral defence and security ties with South&hyphen;East Asian countries&mdash;and I do not have time to go into that in detail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the regional level, the three&hyphen;year&hyphen;old ASEAN regional forum, the ARF, is characterised by minimal institutionalisation and consensus decision making. The second stage of the ARF's activities, in terms of preventative diplomacy, is already showing good potential. At the third ARF meeting in July last year, for example, the Indonesian foreign minister, Ali Alatas, used his good offices as chairman to convey ARF members' concerns about the situation and the difficulties in Burma, or Myanmar, to the Burmese foreign minister. In terms of the multilateral dimension, Australia is strongly committed to working to rid the world of antipersonnel landmines&mdash;and we heard a lot about that earlier in the week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third key aspect of this government's foreign policy has been to enhance Australia's broader global links. The government regards our links with other countries beyond the region as important and appreciating assets. For example, there was revitalisation of Australia's relationship with France after the difficulties of the testing in the Pacific; political military talks with Germany were launched last year; and, beyond Europe, the government held the inaugural meeting between Australia and the Rio group in South America last year as a preparatory step to closer trade, aviation and communication links between the two countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fourth aspect is, very importantly, humanitarian issues. I am sure my colleague the member for Aston (Mr Nugent), Chairman of the Human Rights Subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, who is sitting alongside me, will agree that a fourth pillar of Australia's approach to its international relationships is a focus on humane and principled foreign policy. We are vitally concerned with upholding internationally recognised standards of human rights and with looking for practical ways to enhance individual dignity and freedom and to promote democracy internationally. We have done a number of things in terms of the International Red Cross and Bougainville&mdash;which, again, the right honourable member for New England referred to, and I will not go into those things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me finish by saying that a strong commitment to concrete results and initiatives has been the touchstone of the government's foreign policy to date. That is now reflected in a strategic sense in this white paper. However, we are not resting on our laurels and the task ahead is not only to follow up these directions but to shape Australia's foreign policy in the long term, and this white paper gives us the genesis of that strategy.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11028">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a government, we understand that the success of Australia's foreign policy depends on our domestic economic performance and, to that end, the government's commitment to fiscal discipline and our determination to reform the labour market and the waterfront will have a direct impact on Australia's international competitiveness and our long&hyphen;term prosperity and priorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, it is with pleasure that I support this white paper. I commend the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer), in particular, for his initiative. I know personally some of the members of that review group, and I am sure they will not mind if I specifically refer to my old friend and long&hyphen;term naval colleague Admiral Mike Hudson, who I know played a very important part in developing this white paper. I congratulate him, I congratulate the group collectively and I commend the white paper to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The fundamental principle which defines good government is the capacity to act at all times in the interest of the nation in matters of domestic and foreign policy. The coalition government has embraced this concept in all aspects of government. As distinct from the former Labor government, the coalition will not, in circumstances where the principal interests of the nation are not catered for or held paramount, be held ransom to the demands of publicly militant minorities. Responsible, competent government listens to the concerns of each member of the community but, ultimately, determines policy by asking: is this in the national interest? Will this decision benefit a majority of Australians? Will this lend itself to a better Australia?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In its term of government, the Labor Party attempted to sabotage this process through campaigns of polarisation, laced with tired and stale arguments. The Labor Party window&hyphen;dresses these arguments by loosely using the word `vision' and it expects the electorate to buy it. I give the electorate more credit than that. This federal government is in a coalition with the Australian people, using the guiding principle of the national interest as a beacon for a shared vision at the dawn of an exciting century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a priority of this government to prepare Australia for the next century. In making these preparations, we acknowledge that sentimentality is not a luxury we can afford or enjoy. We are part of an international community which continues to mature and evolve. Sentimental politics and policy belong to organisations such as the One Nation Party, and not to a responsible progressive government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Internationally, this evolution includes increasingly competitive trading markets, a combination of both solid and fragile international relationships, technological advancements of an almost incomprehensible dimension, and a moral and commercial need for all countries to enjoy economic prosperity. Domestically, our population is healthier and is living longer, and our young have opportunities not dreamed of a generation ago, and yet are faced with challenges and pressures which are particular to their time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we move towards vital economic and foreign policy reforms in preparation for the next century, there exists a dual responsibility, for we also have a responsibility to ensure that the elderly, the poor and the young are not left to fend for themselves. That would only serve to widen the social divisions which this nation has worked hard to close. It would not be in the national interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The white paper, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">In the national interest</EMPHASIS>, implicitly acknowledges that exports earned this country over $100 billion last financial year alone. The white paper demonstrates that this government recognises that hundreds of thousands of Australian families rely on our lucrative 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11029"> and expanding export industry. Over 345,000 Australian jobs are attached to our export market to Japan alone. In the agricultural sector, around 80 per cent of our product is exported to international markets. Of this, approximately 56 per cent of our total agricultural exports are marketed in APEC countries alone. It is quite clear that the benefits of trade liberalisation are not confined to or restricted by geographical boundaries within our nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Among other issues, the white paper is also about protecting the jobs associated with our export industry through good policy and creating additional export oriented jobs for the future. Trade liberalisation ultimately means more jobs for Australians. The white paper acknowledges that Australia must become more competitive in manufacturing and the production of goods and services. The presence of tariffs, while often unavoidable, retards our competitive potential. Australia's motor vehicle industry and textile, clothing and footwear industries recognise this fact and, to their credit, are making the appropriate reforms to their operations, with the support, encouragement and continued assistance of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, this document is far more comprehensive than merely confining itself to the fiscal advantages of a foreign policy appropriate to our times. Australia has an opportunity&mdash;and perhaps a responsibility&mdash;to play a vital role in international affairs, particularly in our own region. Our traditionally strong relationships with Europe and the United States, coupled with our geographic location and developing bonds with our Asian neighbours, suggests that Australia has the potential to be an international power of significant influence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Understanding and preaching the concept of globalisation will be a preliminary and key element to this process if Australia is to fulfil its ultimate potential. Globalisation, underpinned by the communications revolution, is not a new phenomenon, nor is it a trendy buzz word. Globalisation is primarily characterised by technological advancements, population mobility and trade liberalisation. Globalisation does not threaten national independence, nor does it foster an unhealthy culture of international interdependence. The theory of globalisation recognises that each nation will benefit by embracing strong and compatible relationships with other nations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian government's response to the current emergency in Papua New Guinea, for example, is a necessary humanitarian obligation. However, it also recognises, although less importantly, that we have an interest in that nation's prosperity. In its most fundamental sense, globalisation rejects an inward, introspective approach to foreign policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former Labor government boasted that they understood the mechanics and relevance of globalisation and bilateral relationships. It was a curious boast, particularly when one recalls the obvious and predictable damage caused by the former Prime Minister's famous `recalcitrant' accusation against the Prime Minister of Malaysia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia's potential as a nation of constructive, international influence is best illustrated in the context of our relationships with the United States and Japan. In recent history, Australia has persuaded the United States to abandon several policy decisions which related to the Pacific region. More specifically, the separate threats from the United States that China's most favoured nation status and Indonesia's developing nation concessions were to be contingent on their respective human rights records were confrontations that were avoided due to Australian influence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The appointment of Mr Andrew Peacock, a former distinguished member of this House, as Australia's ambassador to the United States was both timely and appropriate. An acknowledged 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11030"> authority on American foreign policy, Mr Peacock will cultivate stronger and more respected bonds between the two nations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While our imports from the US have continued to grow at a steady rate over the last decade, the same cannot be said of our export relationship with this market. The value of our exports to the US has oscillated between stagnant and prosperous over the same period of time. It would be simple to provide a cursory explanation for this by referring to the barriers surrounding our agricultural trading relationship with the US. However, to do so would be quite unfair. The primary factor in Australia's substantial trade deficit with the US is the relatively low level of complementarity between their import needs and our product export abilities. This is not to say that we cannot meet the import needs of the US.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition government is committed to strengthening its political and commercial relationships with our Asian neighbours. However, in doing so, we cannot neglect our traditional relationships with the United States and Europe. Indeed, finding our niche in these lucrative markets is the challenge that this nation and this government face. It is a challenge which requires a lateral approach. In identifying and prioritising Australia's contemporary and prospective foreign and trade policies, the white paper encourages such an approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this age of possibility, Australia has a unique opportunity to broker a trilateral understanding between our nation, the United States and Japan. It would be an opportunity to incorporate our joint aspirations of establishing and maintaining positive relationships with both our Asian neighbours and the United States.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia's strong trading relationship with Japan is well documented, but our relationship extends beyond this limiting calculation. Buoyed and nurtured by a thriving Japanese tourist industry in this country, Australia and Japan have developed a mutual respect and comprehension of each other's culture and political and mercantile structures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the lingual and cultural differences, Australia and Japan are closely aligned in terms of economic and political values. Furthermore, both countries are regional powers and have an active interest in regional security. Indeed, it has been argued by many that Australia has more in common with Japan than many of our geographically closer neighbours. This must never be confused with the notion that we should abandon the interests of our neighbours. To do so would contradict our commitment to globalisation. However, it must be recognised that Australia has an opportunity to cement strong and productive relationships with world powers such as Japan and the United States. These are not relationships of prestige; they are relationships which would give Australia an opportunity to be a real leader in our international region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The controversial but often misunderstood currency swap of $1.35 billion to assist Thailand's troubled dormant economy is evidence of our growing leadership role in the immediate region. It demonstrates to our regional neighbours that Australia's commitment to Asia is much more than rhetoric. It may, for instance, convince Malaysia that Australia should have a place at the annual meetings of the Asia-Europe meeting, ASEM. It is also worth considering what the response would have been had Australia declined the request for support organised for the IMF. What message would this have sent to our Asian neighbours?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Likewise, the United States have also adopted a responsible proactive approach to Cambodia's democratic and consequent social problems. It is not just evidence of the compatibility in foreign policies between our countries, nor is it merely evidence of the emphases that both countries place on globalisation and bilateral relations. The involvement 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11031"> of the United States demonstrates that the rule of law, an independent judiciary and a government accountable through elections are essential in maintaining peace and facilitating social and economic development in Cambodia. This economic development will, in turn, benefit Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The struggle to establish a legitimate workable democracy in Cambodia has been a matter of great international concern. The principal motivation has been a humanitarian concern. However, there also exists the understanding that several countries can indirectly gain from Cambodia's political and, thus, fiscal stability. Australia and the world have invested billions of dollars in Cambodian industry, commerce and infrastructure since the embryonic stages of democracy in that country. Any responsible strategy to protect our investment, while simultaneously fostering political freedom for the people of Cambodia, must incorporate a long&hyphen;term strategy involving democracy and political freedom.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although the recent attempt to establish an administratively workable democracy in Cambodia failed, the international community should not be discouraged. Tangible gains toward the democratisation of Cambodia have been achieved. The democratisation of Cambodia has been added to by the efforts of a number of nations and agencies. The National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, NDI, is one such agency. The NDI are assisting two coalitions of non&hyphen;government organisations, the Committee for Free and Fair Elections and the Coalition for Free and Fair elections. These organisations have been structured to orchestrate a national civic education program, in addition to monitoring the coordination and implementation of the proposed elections.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, it cannot be denied that there still exist several barriers and obstacles to securing an environment that is conducive to a fair election. This is largely due to escalating tensions between the ruling coalition partners, the CPP and Funcipec. Joint initiatives to establish a framework for the conduct of a national election to date have failed, leaving the process stalled. The national assembly vote on 6 August to replace the duly elected First Prime Minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, cannot be objectively regarded as authentic and legitimate. It was rather the product of coercion and sinister motives. Reports of intimidation and voting under fear of threats of violence are numerous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the bloody coup of earlier this year, all indications are that Second Prime Minister Hun Sen and the CPP have consolidated their control and dominance over the Cambodian government, police, judiciary and military. A systematic campaign of identification, isolation and duress has resulted in the detention of an unknown number of political activists. There are proportionately substantiated claims that up to 40 to 60 royalist supporters were executed in the aftermath of the coup.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is little likelihood that free and fair elections will ever be conducted in the existing political climate. Accordingly, it is not conceivable that genuine democratic elections can be achieved by May 1998. There is no evidence to suggest the present government has a sincere commitment to the democratic process. The 20 parliamentarians or counterparts who fled Cambodia in fear of their lives continue to live in exile, mostly in Bangkok. A sincere attempt to conduct an election must allow these elected representatives to return to contest the next election should they wish to do so. Assurances from the present Cambodian government are clearly insufficient. The international community needs evidence. The international community cannot afford to abdicate its responsibility to protect Cambodia's delicate and fragile 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11032"> democratic gains. We must be committed to a democratic vision for Cambodia; we must be faithful to that vision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The white paper highlights the fact that, despite the world's enduring tension and its emerging threats, we cannot and must not choose escapism over engagement. There are a number of issues that I would like to have touched on in the white paper that I did not have time for this morning. They cover things like the Cambodian seat at the United Nations and who should fill it; our response and government attitude to the ending of IMF and World Bank aid to Cambodia that occurred out of the United States; the aid the Australian government could give to the Union for Democratic Cambodia that operates in Bangkok, which consists of an alliance between Khmer Nation, Khmer Neutral, Funcipec and the Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party. I might leave that for another day.</PARA>
