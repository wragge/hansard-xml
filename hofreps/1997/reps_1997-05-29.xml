<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Speaker, the bill amends the International Monetary Agreements Act 1947 to allow Australia to adhere to the International Monetary Fund's new arrangements to borrow and to simplify the framework for conducting and recording Australia's other financial transactions with the IMF.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new arrangements to borrow, NAB, were developed following the financial crisis in Mexico in late 1994. The Mexican crisis prompted concerns about the adequacy of the IMF's resources in the event of possible future crises affecting the international monetary system, in view of the growing size and integration of international financial markets. The NAB will double the IMF's capacity to borrow to forestall or cope with an impairment of the international monetary system or to deal with an exceptional situation that poses a threat to the stability of that system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Honourable members will be aware that Australia played a key role in the development of the NAB&mdash;a role with which we can be justly proud. The establishment of the NAB as the IMF's principal borrowing facility will be a milestone for the institution and the international monetary system. Importantly, it will enhance the IMF's ability to safeguard the international monetary system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The NAB is open to all IMF members that have the capacity, and are willing, to support the international monetary system and partici 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> pants will have equal rights and responsibilities. These two features will do much to ensure that the NAB will be a central element in the management of the international financial system into the next century. The wider participation of member countries in the NAB appropriately reflects the changing structure of the world economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the NAB, the IMF will be able to borrow up to SDR34 billion, or about $A61 billion, from the NAB participants. Australia's share of these credit arrangements is SDR810 million, or about $A1.5 billion. In the event of a call, Australia would lend directly to the IMF and would receive a claim against the fund. The bill provides that any loan to the IMF will be paid out of the consolidated revenue fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the NAB, there is scope for Australia to opt out of calls if the government determines that we will not be able to meet them because of our present and prospective balance of payments and reserve position. We may also, on the basis of a balance of payments need, require early repayment of part or all of any loan we have made to the IMF.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Speaker, Australia undertakes a number of regular financial transactions with the IMF. These include the receipt of interest on special drawing right holdings, interest payments on the use of special drawing rights, quota payments and remuneration received for the use of Australian dollars by the IMF. The bill introduces a simplified framework for the conduct and recording of these transactions. Under the existing arrangements, some of Australia's financial transactions with the IMF are conducted by the transfer of special drawing rights between the Commonwealth and the Reserve Bank and corresponding changes in the bank's retransfer liability to the Commonwealth. Under the new framework, the Commonwealth would purchase and sell all the SDRs required to undertake these transactions with the fund. This will provide for a more transparent and cost efficient framework for such transactions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is desirable that these changes be introduced at the same time as Australia takes up its membership of the new arrangements to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4380"> borrow to ensure that all of these transactions are conducted in a consistent framework.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments proposed in the bill will have no impact on the Commonwealth budget. The changes proposed to the conduct of Australia's financial transactions with the fund affect transactions which are, by accepted international standards, classified as financing transactions. Any loan by the Commonwealth to the IMF under the NAB would also be classified as a financing transaction because loans to the IMF represent monetary assets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The participants in the NAB have agreed that they will meet once a year, in addition to any meetings needed for activation, renewal or amendment of the NAB. The objective of these meetings is to review and discuss macroeconomic and financial market developments, especially those that could have an impact on the stability of the international financial system and lead to a possible need for the fund to seek supplementary resources. This is potentially an important new forum for consideration of these issues. The chairmanship of the NAB will rotate between participants and Australia is expected to provide the first chairman. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill and I commend the bill to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This legislation comes in under the guise of an infrastructure borrowings bill but it is a bill that freezes any further development on infrastructure. This is a government that has undertaken a massive attack on Australia's infrastructure development. It is an attack on industry development, it is an attack on regional development and it is an attack on jobs. It represents one of the great betrayals of the government, having been so compre 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> hensively elected to this parliament to govern by a huge majority through regional Australia with a promise that they would do better for regional Australia, with a promise in particular that they would do something to encourage infrastructure development.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been many betrayals of regional Australia but the attack on infrastructure development stands amongst the highest of them because there must be a commitment to sensible infrastructure, a commitment to opening up the land, whether it be in terms of road or rail&mdash;transport distribution, if you like&mdash;or whether it be in terms of the provision of energy&mdash;gas, electricity or whatever: the sorts of things the cities take for granted that do not exist in the regions. Because they do not exist, you cannot get economic diversity. That is why you need infrastructure. That is why you need a government that is committed to encouraging that infrastructure; not supplying it totally, not funding the lot, but giving encouragement and incentive, a partnership with the private sector, to get those important infrastructure developments going.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Labor was in office we had a number of initiatives in place to support infrastructure development. One of them was the infrastructure fund; another was the tax concessions for investment by the private sector in infrastructure development&mdash;a scheme called the infrastructure bonds; and another was the tax concessionality to superannuation funds and the encouragement to establish pooled development funds so that people from regions could invest in superannuation funds and have those funds, in turn, re&hyphen;invested in their region. These were a number of the initiatives that Labor had&mdash;not the total suite of things, but important initiatives nevertheless.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) is the person who, as one of his first acts, abolished his department. That his why we refer to him only as the minister for transport these days, because he has abolished his own department. He not only abolished his own department but also abolished the infrastructure fund. Having made a commitment at the last election to keep it, he abolished it&mdash;wiped it out completely. And do you know what his explan 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4381"> ation was at the time he abolished it? These were his words: `There is no clear rationale or constitutional basis for Commonwealth involvement in regional development.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This comes from the minister with responsibility for regional development. But worse, he is a member of the National Party. In fact, some talk of him as a future leader. He is amongst those plotting at the moment against their leader, Tim Fischer. I think that with his performance this week he has not advanced his case all that well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We must ask ourselves this question: if the National Party does not stand for regional development, what does it stand for? Here we have an aspirant for leadership of the National Party, given responsibility for regional development, abolishing his department and abolishing the fund, and saying that there is no clear rationale and no role for the Commonwealth in regional economic development. Well, I tell you what: it is a statement that has had huge resonance in the regions because they see this government as not being committed to regional development.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Taxation Laws Amendment (Infrastructure Borrowings) Bill is another example of that lack of commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party believes there is a role for government in regional development&mdash;not just one level of government, but all levels of government. There has to be a commitment by governments to support regional development. There has to be a partnership between those levels of government&mdash;between federal government, state government and local government. There has to be a drawing in of private sector investment. There has to be a pooling of the approach to get our regions opened up and give them the opportunity to develop to the best of their potential and, importantly, to keep their communities cohesive, to give them access by road and rail, to give them access to energy at the same cost as is being provided to the cities, and to give them access to communications type infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But this government, in this bill, has frozen infrastructure bonds. I referred earlier to what Labor introduced by way of the infrastructure bonds&mdash;an important mechanism for attracting 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> private sector investment in regional infrastructure. This was a tax mechanism to encourage investment. Essentially, the principle is pretty simple. If you are investing in infrastructure, there is a long lead time before you get a return. Therefore, there is not the ability to claim the tax deductions associated with the initial capital investment from a cash flow, because it does not exist until later down the track. There is a huge up&hyphen;front cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose of the bonds was essentially to be able to give the tax deduction up front to the investor so that it could lower the cost of capital associated with the infrastructure development&mdash;a very important initiative. It is not reducing the tax burden; it is just shifting the point at which it is paid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what has this government done? It has frozen that scheme. We have had 75 projects in the pipeline waiting for approval over the past 14 months. The government took 12 months to make a decision about those 75 projects and after 12 months the best it could do was freeze them. Great leadership; terrific leadership! It is a great signal to the regions: get on with the task, develop your initiatives, operate as if the law exists for you. Then, having made all the hard yards, the Treasurer (Mr Costello) comes out with a press release&mdash;he does not even come into the parliament to debate it&mdash;and freezes the fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So here are these projects which have been waiting for 12 months up to February of this year for the go ahead. The Treasurer goes out and makes an announcement, `I have got a good announcement for you: we are going to freeze them. You cannot do anything.' But more is to come: `We will come out with a decision in the budget that announces an alternative scheme.' So, (a) they have frozen them, and (b) they have to wait another three months before they see what type of scheme may result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A new scheme has been announced in the budget&mdash;it is not the subject of this debate here now but it connects with it and so I will refer to it briefly&mdash;whereby the amount of money available under the infrastructure bond approach has been reduced. Under Labor's proposal it was worth about $200 million. This government have capped it at $75 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4382"> million, which has reduced it by two&hyphen;thirds. The second thing they have done is limit the types of projects that can qualify to just road and rail. No&hyphen;one is arguing against the fact that road and rail are important for regional economic development&mdash;but so too is power generation, so too is communications infrastructure, so too is wharf development in those regions that have waterfront properties. These are the sorts of infrastructures that matter to regions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What type of lunacy seeks to include only road and rail? This is the mentality of a government that does not understand what is going on in the regions, does not understand that there is a huge preparedness to invest in a whole range of activities. If anyone has any doubt, look at the list of projects that have been put on hold. Look at the list of the 75 projects to date&mdash;and this is just the first cut. There is a whole raft of them: power generation, pipelines, electricity generation, wharf terminal upgrades and water storage activities. These are the sorts of infrastructures that matter to regions, not just road and rail. So why will we have a scheme that so limits it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I return to this bill: essentially this bill does not advance anything. This bill does not even introduce that bit, which is deficient. This bill simply freezes all development. In the process of freezing all development, it has frozen some very significant projects which, in themselves, had been given certification. Not all of them on this list of 75 that I have referred to, at the stage of the freezing, had been given certification. That was the process that they had to go through. What they had to do was get certification, then there was a process by which some of them had to get a letter of approval, and then final certification. Some of them had gone through those stages, yet some of those projects are still frozen by this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Two initiatives got up, as I understand it. One was the Brisbane airport rail link. You have to ask how that actually qualified because the actual detail of that proposal is not even known. But there was, no doubt, pressure from somewhere in the system that gave that a particular tick. I would be interested to know from the minister, if he is prepared to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> come into the House and explain, why it got the tick and others have not. But there was also an operation down at Bairnsdale. I am not arguing against those getting in. I am simply arguing for fair treatment for the others that have got through the certification stage&mdash;in particular the Redbank power station. I know the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) will be referring to that later in the debate. It is a very significant initiative for the Hunter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all know how this government has decimated its future by failing to act in relation to the steel industry. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard), who four weeks ago said he was going to visit the place soon and offer an apology to the region, still has not gone. He is still in hiding from the region. Yesterday, when we sought to bring this on for debate in the House he gagged it. Some concern for the Hunter. What a fraud! This is a government that talks about the need for regional development, expresses unctuous concern for the people in regions, but will do nothing. It will not lift a finger to help them. It will not even pick up the phone to John Prescott of BHP and say, `Can we sit down and talk about the future of the steel industry?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that BHP is going to invest in steel making around the world. Why isn't it going to invest here? It promised an arc furnace in Newcastle at some stage in the future&mdash;the latest technology. It has invested in an arc furnace, but it has invested in Ohio, USA, because that country has offered it tax breaks; it has offered it free land; it has been prepared to sit down and work out what is needed to attract that investment. This government will not. This government is hands&hyphen;off: hands&hyphen;off the brakes, hands&hyphen;off the steering wheel, let it rip and see what happens. You can see what is happening in the Hunter and Newcastle. You can see the lives that are being decimated. You can see the futures that are being destroyed. You can see the hope ebbing out of the system. These are people that have made a commitment to their region and they expect a commitment in turn from the government, but they are not getting it.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4383">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the initiatives, as I say, is the Redbank power station. This is a major initiative, one the private sector is prepared to fund but it can only get up if the infrastructure bonds apply, because that does reduce the up&hyphen;front cost of the capital. This is a power station that will use coal tailings as its feed stock; in other words, it is using waste coal. It is environmentally more sound. It is also using technology for the generation of the electricity which is 15 per cent more efficient in terms of ozone emissions; in other words, there is less coming out and polluting the atmosphere. This is an investment that makes environmental sense, not just economic sense. But it has been frozen. It was given what was considered to be approval, the go ahead, yet this bill freezes it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where is the commitment to the Hunter? Where is the commitment by this government to encouraging and assisting regions to enable investments to go ahead? I tell you what: no wonder the regions are turning on you. You have no understanding of what the particular needs of those regions are. We are moving an amendment to this bill&mdash;the first stage of our assault on this government's attack on the regions to try to claw back the initiatives&mdash;that will see four of those projects get the go ahead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are the projects that, as I understand it, have gone through the certification stage: Redbank, which I have made some reference to; the Oakey power station; the Parkeston power station in Kalgoorlie, Western Australia; and the Port Stephens sewage processing facility. This bill freezes them; our amendment will unfreeze them. When the next wave of attack on regional infrastructure&mdash;the budget measure that restricts those projects that can qualify and limits the amount of money they can claim&mdash;comes before this parliament, we will be seeking to amend it again so that these other projects that were in the list can qualify.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem is that a lot of those projects that the financiers are prepared to back will now become non&hyphen;viable because the infrastructure bonds will not be applicable to them. Either they will not be able to access enough money from the pool or they will not be in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the category of road and rail. We will be seeking, firstly, to lift the amount that is available and, secondly, to open up those sorts of initiatives and the types of things that can qualify.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another thing that this bill does, that is, to terminate the infrastructure borrowing scheme which was introduced by Labor as part of our <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One nation </EMPHASIS>statement. We introduced this because private investors had long complained that the tax system was biased against private provision of infrastructure. It involved assisting private sector involvement by a modification of the tax system. Private sector investment was historically impeded because the initial year's losses generated by most of the projects could not be offset against the other income of the investors unless the project was undertaken by a single investor only as part of a wholly owned company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sheer size of most infrastructure projects meant that no Australian company was big enough to undertake the project on their own. It is generally commercially advantageous to have partners as they provide the expertise that is so often needed. These projects, though, would not confront the tax problem that I talked about before. The IBS, this scheme that we introduced, overcame the problem by reducing the cost of infrastructure finance by effectively transferring the tax benefit of the tax deductibility of interest from borrower to lender. The projects were always assessed by a statutory authority. We made sure that they were arms&hyphen;length from the government and set up criteria by which the schemes had to be measured.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That system was starting to function very effectively. There were some problems with it, and Labor announced when we were in office that the IBS would cease to be available for urban roads from late 1995&mdash;a decision, I might say, that was rejected by the then Deputy Leader of the Opposition, now the Treasurer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was also some evidence that aggressive tax planning was creeping into the marketing of IBS at the retail level. These were matters that did warrant addressing and we were doing that. Whilst we were prepared 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4384"> to address limiting those clever operators who could exploit the system, we were still keen on keeping the system going because it was responding to a market failure need. It was responding to what the financial institutions were telling us needed to be addressed. We were prepared to cap, we were prepared to limit the types of investors that could get into the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we would not have frozen the scheme. What this government has done is throw the baby out with the bathwater. Every time the Treasury gets worried about the cost to government it trots out the same excuse to this government as it did to us. They never liked these schemes and you will have the same problem in government trying to get your initiatives up as we did because essentially Treasury does not believe in them. That is the truth of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only way you are going to overcome that, quite frankly, is to have a government and a Treasurer prepared to stand up to them, to have a cabinet that understands the importance of them and tackles the Treasury on the practicality and not just the theory. We were saying, `Yes, by all means close off the rorts, but don't end the scheme.' But that is exactly what Treasurer Costello did. He used the tired old excuse of Treasury since time immemorial&mdash;`If the revenue forgone starts to get too great in our estimates, let's call it a rort and abolish it.' Pretty simple, but pretty effective in terms of this Treasurer, because that is what he has done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was the same approach he used to tax syndication: an announcement by way of press release&mdash;again, no announcement in the parliament&mdash;to end the syndicated taxation research, asserting that the scheme was being rorted. We challenged him time and time again in this parliament to produce the examples of rorts and he did not produce one. He actually put out a press release at the time of his announcement with some examples, as he called them, of the tax rorts, but as we questioned his department not one of those examples was actual. The Treasurer was using the Wright family&mdash;the fictitious family that was rorting the social security system. Peter 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Costello found that they were into tax syndication.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not one example was actual. When we had that debate in the parliament, and it went for a number of hours, he was sitting at the table that the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) is sitting at now, hanging his head in shame signing Christmas cards. We challenged him and gave him opportunity time and time again to get up at the dispatch box and give us the examples of where the rorts were.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He could not produce one example, yet that is the basis on which you have frozen this scheme as well&mdash;same excuse, no evidence, and the impact is devastating for regional Australia. It is a shameful approach for a government. This is a government that has not got ideas, not got intelligence and not got the moral fortitude to actually work through initiatives and see if they mean something for regions. This is a government bereft of ideas. Its only notion of governing is getting the bottom line down, regardless of the consequences. That is not good enough for a nation like ours that has natural resources, that has good infrastructure in the main but needs to develop it, that has the technology and that has the skills. What it needs is the ability to bring it together, and one of the things that will bring it together is investment in infrastructure. That is why we are not only opposing this legislation and seeking to move the amendment but also will be seeking in this and the other house to oppose the subsequent scheme that, we understand, will come forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mentioned before the importance of assisting infrastructure development in a number of ways. I have spoken at some length about the infrastructure bonds, which were one of the arrows in the quiver that Labor had for encouraging regional development. Another was the infrastructure fund, which this current government promised to keep but abolished. I just want to give an example of how that infrastructure fund worked. A very good example is the Orana gas pipeline, which is an infrastructure development sought to be funded in the Dubbo&hyphen;Parkes area, essentially to supply energy at 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4385"> Sydney&hyphen;competitive prices to western New South Wales so that the region can attract manufacturing businesses such as food processing companies and the like.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cost of that investment was some $44 million, and the financial sector was prepared to fund it if it was $42 million. In other words, it was just short by $2 million. Essentially, the infrastructure fund under Labor funded that $2 million, and so the pipeline was able to go ahead&mdash;this, I might add, in circumstances in which the financial sector was operating on the basis of the infrastructure bonds being in place. So they went ahead, developed a proposal, and included the infrastructure bonds in the financing arrangement, and we approved the $2 million from the infrastructure fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Interestingly enough, when the Howard government came to power, that $2 million also could have been at risk. The problem and the trouble for the government, which dearly would have loved to have got its grubby little hands on it and taken it back into Treasury, was that we had already signed off on it. That pipeline was able to go ahead only because of the money that Labor had committed&mdash;money that the Liberals wanted to take away from them and that the National Party could not have cared less about. That is the difference between us and you in terms of regional development, but the fact of the matter is that this pipeline, whilst the first stages of it have been built, cannot now be extended to the 255 kilometres of pipeline that run from Marsden through the cities of Forbes, Parkes and Dubbo.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a project that has been on the drawing board for five years. It has got the support of the regional development board, the state government, local councils and regions. AGL, which has spent five years in community consultations on the project, got the Commonwealth to formally support it on 9 February 1996&mdash;that is when they realised that they could not take the $2 million off them&mdash;and the community thought that the wait was over. But one year and five days later, having given the approval back in February 1996, the government withdrew it. This is great government! This is the government that does not 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> know what it is doing. This is the government that comes in here and says to people, `We support regional development', but effectively mocks them because whenever it comes to actually supporting the proposals it is not there delivering.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Orana gas pipeline is not something that Canberra thought up and said, `Let us have an initiative that might help out there and we will stick a pipeline in.' This is something that has come from the community. It is not something that governments simply say&mdash;`We will develop a proposal and we will fund it regardless of the consequences.' It has got to stack up. It has got to be supported by the private sector. But government has got a role to play&mdash;it is this leverage of government; it is the ability to use the programs to deal yourself in and to make yourselves relevant; that is what government is about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the purpose of getting elected to just rule off bottom lines? What is the purpose of getting elected if you are not going to do something to advance the interests of the nation? What is the purpose of believing that all you have to do is to manage the budget and the rest will follow? It does not work that way. You have to get your hands dirty, to get out amongst the regions, to understand their needs, to work with them, to understand the initiatives, to put them through the financial rigour, and to make sure the proposals stack up, but in the end to give them confidence that you are prepared to back them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor is prepared to back the regions. That is why we have already announced that we will re&hyphen;establish that regional infrastructure fund, the one that made the Orana gas pipeline happen, the one that, for the sake of $2 million, generated $44 million of investment. That is smart government. That is the proper use of government resources. That is committing yourself to the region and not just promising wish lists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what you have done? You have got a Federation Fund; you will go around the place and build a few museums in marginal seats because you are looking pretty shaky. You talk about our whiteboard&mdash;this will be a huge screen like the MCG's big  scoreboard: `Have we got a scheme for you!'&mdash;big star. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4386"> The member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) may not be here, but he will get a project. But people just do not want museums. They want infrastructure and it is these sorts of initiatives that will help them get it. Labor is committed to the re&hyphen;establishment of the infrastructure fund. Labor will move this amendment in the House to make sure that four important projects that got certification can go ahead. Two have been given the tick. Why can't the other four be given the tick?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have just listened very carefully to the contribution by the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) in the debate on the Taxation Laws Amendment (Infrastructure Borrowings) Bill. We heard regional development mentioned probably every minute of the last 30 minutes. Where did he end up? The MCG. The member for Hotham, after his long personal journey from school in Melbourne to university in Melbourne to President of the ACTU in Melbourne, has suddenly discovered the regions outside of Melbourne, Sydney and Canberra. After the last election, the Australian Labor Party became a party for Melbourne, Sydney and Canberra. Outside those cities they hold something like 11 of the 90&hyphen;odd seats.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Hotham, as shadow minister for regional development, has had to rediscover the regions. In fact, he, along with the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson), has become something like the Leyland brothers of the 1990s. Every week he gets a letter from a new region, he discovers a new region&mdash;such as Adelaide, Bendigo or Newcastle&mdash;and has a look at that region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What he should have said is that in the last two months of the operation of the infrastructure borrowings scheme the Development Allowance Authority had assessed that benefit was going not actually to infrastructure but to financial packages and also to those who were on the highest marginal tax rate. Treasury estimated that, if all those projects went ahead, there would be something like a $4 billion cost to the budget. If the ALP opposes the closing off of the infrastructure borrow 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ings scheme then they should be able to say where they  are going to raise that $4 billion extra in tax or where they are going to cut $4 billion from government outlays.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were 12 projects with applications to the infrastructure borrowings scheme between 1994 and 1996. In July and August of last year there were 71 applications. So there was a huge explosion and not all of it was going to infrastructure. This government will be closing off the infrastructure borrowings scheme, which dates back to Paul Keating's One Nation statement, and it will be replacing it with a $75 million capped fund and the $1 billion Federation Fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill gives effect to the announcement by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) on 14 February this year that the infrastructure borrowings concession would be abolished from 12 p.m. on that day. The amendments contained in the bill prevent the lodging of any new infrastructure borrowing applications after that time, the issue of any further infrastructure borrowing certificates and the variation of conditions underlying existing certificates after that time that increase tax benefits. The amendments will not otherwise affect already issued certificates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In other words, the bill is aimed at preventing the abuse of the infrastructure borrowings taxation concession&mdash;a rort which, if not attended to, would have serious ramifications on government revenue of something like $4 billion. The Treasurer is on the public record as saying that the government is obviously very keen to encourage infrastructural investment but that the taxpayer is entitled to know that the tax support which is facilitating an infrastructural development scheme is not wasteful from the revenue point of view. The Treasurer stated in his press conference on 14 February this year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We're doing all of this because if the revenue foregone is in the billions or more, somebody has got to make up and if it's made up by battling taxpayers they just pay more and it's not fair that it be made up on the outlays side with battling allowance receivers . . . This is a question of the Government  . . . looking after the interests of the battling taxpayer and the person who's honestly receiving entitlements which they're entitled to receive. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4387">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">To understand this bill one has to understand the history of infrastructure investment in this country&mdash;that is, how traditional methods of funding public infrastructure investments have come under pressure over the last decade. Put simply, in an attempt to reduce our current account deficit and our associated reliance on overseas savings by increasing public sector savings, Australian governments have realised that they have restricted public finance for building or maintaining infrastructure. Both Commonwealth and state governments have dealt with the restriction of funds by transferring the responsibility of infrastructure finance onto the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In examining the decline in Australia's public capital spending in recent years, Ms Julie Smith, a consultant to the Department of the Parliamentary Library's Economics, Commerce and Industrial Relations Group, introduced her 1994 research paper by asking whether current levels of infrastructure investment were too low or whether the public sector was unjustifiably reducing its investment in public assets. Julie Smith's question was a good one. What has happened to public infrastructure funding in Australia and why is it an issue worthy of continued research? In using the term `infrastructure', I refer to transport, communications and energy networks, but it is also worthwhile noting that the social capital of the country can also be defined more widely to include the likes of publicly owned education, health and prison facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a fact that since the mid&hyphen;1980s there has been a sharp reduction in Australian public capital spending and that this sharp reduction follows a gradual decline in public capital spending over previous decades. For example, public capital formation is now around four per cent of GDP compared with more than eight per cent in the 1960s. Infrastructure spending in Australia has traditionally been financed by public borrowing and paid for by various combinations of state and federal taxation and charges on users of public services. While responsibility for infrastructure investment tends to lie with Australian state and local governments and their enterprises, such investment has largely 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> been funded both directly and indirectly by the Commonwealth government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem for contemporary infrastructural development and renewal is that the transfer of Commonwealth revenues to state and local governments and public enterprises has nearly halved in the last eight years. Over that same period, aggregate public sector borrowing has been curtailed. That assault on public debt is linked to the sound fiscal policy pursued by this government, wherein it is recognised that it is important for our economic wellbeing that we increase national savings and reduce the external account imbalance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In reflecting on the current level of public infrastructure spending, Smith outlined in her paper three areas of concern. The first area of concern is whether investment in new infrastructure has been sufficient to keep up with needs during the rapid population and economic growth of the 1980s, with the possibility of an urgent backlog of new public infrastructure investment to be funded in the near future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second area of concern is whether sufficient provision had been made for the repair, maintenance and, ultimately, replacement of existing assets, some of which are nearing the end of their economic life, with significant maintenance and replacement costs in the foreseeable future. In some cases shortage of capital funds has resulted in the deferral of maintenance, reducing the economic life of infrastructure assets. In other words, in the case of roads, for example, too much emphasis has been on maintenance and too little on expanding network capacity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third area of concern is how future funding needs will be affected by economic and demographic change requiring different focus, forms or location of infrastructure, new production and pricing technologies, and the increased cost of higher standards to protect the natural environment against effects of economic growth and population expansion. Perceived political limits to taxation and rates, combined with the current fixation with limiting borrowing to reduce already relatively small public sector debt levels, point to con 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4388"> tinued shortages of government capital funds for infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Traditionally, infrastructure projects have been popular with Australian governments and with the Australian people. Apart from being large employers of labour, it is commonly recognised that infrastructure investment contributes to the productivity of private sector growth. In a recent article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> entitled `Employers in a welfare state' on Thursday, 15 May 1997, Simon Longstaff, the Executive Director of the St James Ethics Centre, made the following point:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The idea that the community should provide significant financial assistance to business is nothing new. If one adds the value of direct subsidies to the cost of providing the infrastructure business needs, then the community already provides a huge amount of money to augment the funds of shareholders.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Few would argue that the community's investment is a poor one. There is an implicit logic to the arrangement. In return for massive investment by the community, business plays a vital role in increasing the stock of common good to be enjoyed by society&mdash;jobs, wealth and a host of other goods.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The problem that Australian governments now have is a shortage of funds or, more particularly, a shortage of savings. Not surprisingly it is a problem that the previous Prime Minister, Paul Keating, also faced. Steeped in the recession that we had to have, Paul Keating's One Nation statement&mdash;launched in February 1992&mdash;was an attempt to revive the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, the One Nation statement was only a reflection of the same opportunism which characterised Paul Keating's rise to the prime ministership. That is to say, knowing that Bill Ludwig and the Queensland Right, the Victorian Right and certain influential members of the Western Australian Right&mdash;such as the current Leader of the Opposition&mdash;were loath to support him against Bob Hawke, Paul, desperate for the top job, sold out and began cutting deals with the Left. In the process of schmoozing the Left, Paul Keating was forced to make certain commitments that were integral components of the Left's agenda; hence the peculiar document One Nation.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In One Nation, Paul discovered infrastructure. Just as one of his best mates, the member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton), had enjoyed considerable notoriety with the Sydney monorail, Paul decided it was his turn. As outlined before, faced with a lack of funds, Paul turned to the concept of infrastructure borrowings. According to John Kavanagh, writing in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS> of 2 July, 1993, Keating's development finance and infrastructure bond initiative was a fizzer. We have heard the member for Hotham talking about how great it was. At the time it was a fizzer. To quote directly from the article:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The slow take off of many of the government's initiatives has been well documented, but One Nation has other problems that are just coming to light. The package included two tax&hyphen;advantaged investment incentives: pooled development funds and infrastructure bonds. So far, not a single dollar has been invested through these vehicles.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The major drawbacks for institutional investors were the cumbersome conditions and restrictions that operated on the funds. As a result, in 1994 the Keating government made certain amendments to the concept of infrastructure borrowings as part of that other doomed statement, Working Nation. Under the infrastructure borrowings tax concession, the person who borrows funds forgoes the right to use the interest paid on those borrowings as a tax deduction and in return the lender&mdash;that is, the person who receives the interest&mdash;gets that interest tax exempt. According to the Treasurer in the press conference on 14 February this year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The object of that arrangement was for borrowers for whom tax deductions are not necessarily useful because in stand alone projects, they may not have had revenue streams to use them up, would pass the value of those tax concessions to lenders who in return would give lower interest rates to the borrowers and enable infrastructure to go ahead.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In the period between 1994, when the Development Allowance Authority assumed responsibility for this, up until 30 June 1996, it had issued certificates in respect of 12 projects with a total borrowing of $4 billion and it had six applications on hand. But in the months of July and August last year, when there was some speculation that the infrastructure borrowings scheme might end, it received 71 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4389"> applications. So in the previous two years it had 12 certifications with six applications pending. In the two months leading up to 20 August, there were 71 applications for estimated infrastructure borrowings of around $21 billion to $22 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In responding to this fervour for infrastructure projects running all over Australia, the Treasurer closed the scheme to new applications on 10 September last year. At the same time, the Treasurer instructed the Development Allowance Authority to investigate all of the applications. According to estimates prepared by the DAA, if all of those applications were certified and the projects went ahead, the cost to revenue over the next three years would be $4 billion. The authority further advised that if any of the applications were amended to make them more tax aggressive, the cost could be substantially higher. To quote again from the Treasurer's press conference statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What the investigation by the Development Allowance Authority also shows is that the benefits in the re&hyphen;engineered schemes are principally being accessed by financial packages and high marginal taxpayers, or people who would be otherwise high marginal taxpayers, not the developers concerned.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">For example, a person could be offered $500,000 worth of infrastructure borrowings. They also take a loan to buy those infrastructure borrowings. They pay interest in advance on the loan. They pay a management fee, and that requires $585,000. The loan which they take is $549,000 and they pay $36,000. They resell the bond back to the lender who gives them the loan and that extinguishes the loan. The interest they pay on the loan to buy the infrastructure bond is deductible, as is the management fee. As a result of that transaction, for an investment of $36,000, they get $85,000 worth of tax deductions. So if the ALP opposes closing off this infrastructure borrowings scheme, then it is defending a rort.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the top marginal rate, the return is worth $41,582. In this particular example, you buy the bond on 28 June for $36,000. You get $85,000 worth of deductions in that financial year, which is worth a return of $41,000 after tax. You can re&hyphen;buy the same bond in the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> next financial year and get the deductions again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 27 February, the Deputy Chairman of major infrastructure financier Macquarie Bank was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government was right in stopping infrastructure bonds a couple of weeks ago because there was a lot of double dipping going on by creative tax planners, and they had to put a stop to it.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Addressing the Institute of Company Directors in Melbourne on 26 February, Mr Cox was also reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Infrastructure as an asset class has strong appeal to institutions because of the stability and duration of its cash flow and the fact that the revenue is often inflation indexed . . . The Australian market is rapidly accepting this new asset class.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Bearing that in mind, the government in its recent budget decided to introduce a new tax rebate&mdash;$75 million&mdash;to continue Commonwealth support of private sector provision of public infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The program will be open for applications for assistance in respect of, amongst other projects, private land transport infrastructure projects. That $75 million capped infrastructure fund, together with the $1 billion Federation Fund which will allow projects of national significance to be built over the next four years, I think means that the 1906 idea of a rail link from Adelaide to Darwin now has a real chance of going ahead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are not many competing projects for infrastructure in South Australia and the Northern Territory. That, I think, should be the recommendation of the South Australian government and the Northern Territory government as being the infrastructure project they would like to go ahead with under the $1 billion Federation Fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At first blush, the $75 million tax rebate looks like the old one in that it will permit resident infrastructure financiers to apply for a tax rebate on interest received from infrastructure providers in return for the infrastructure providers forgoing the tax deductibility on that interest. That will benefit infrastructure providers because financiers will be able to offer lower rates of interest or other benefits. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4390">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rate of the rebate will be set at the lower end of the financier's current year marginal tax rate or 36 per cent and will be available in respect of the grossed up amount of interest on borrowings that is returned as income by the financier. However, the most important aspect of this new rebate is that it is not tradeable. If the loan interest is assigned to another entity, neither the assignee nor the assignor will be eligible for the rebate from the time of the assignment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cost to the budget of the rebate will be capped at $75 million per annum, including running costs. Once this cap has been reached, further rebates will not be approved. There will be no avenue of appeal against government decisions on a project's eligibility. Other measures designed to prevent the rorts that operated under the former government's infrastructure borrowings rebate is that at stage 1 projects will be examined to determine whether they fall into an eligible category for assistance, involve genuine private provision of new public infrastructure and have been subject to benefit&hyphen;cost analysis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At stage 2 the basis for assessment will be commercial viability, supporting commercial references, the impact of tax benefits on the project and the estimated present value of the cost to the revenue of the tax rebate being granted to the project relative to the present value of the total project expenditure. Quite obviously, another reference point for assessment will be the consistency of the proposed investment with any relevant Commonwealth or state policy or planning objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The program will have effect from 1997-98 with approval for rebates first being granted in respect of applications received by 31 December 1997. It is my understanding that the Commissioner for Taxation will shortly be calling for applications. I commend this bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak to the Taxation Laws Amendment (Infrastructure Borrowings) Bill. I propose to speak to the general framework of the bill and to make some comment on the decisions announced by the government in the budget which are directly linked to this particular proposal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Hotham (Mr Crean), the shadow minister for industry and regional development, circulated some amendments at the conclusion of his contribution which will be dealt with in the consideration in detail stage. I hope to join that debate and make some observations on that occasion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In general terms, the House should be fully aware of the very adverse consequences for Australia's economic development generally, and in its regions, of this bill and the parallel decision that relates to it which has been made in the budget. There are two significant aspects that need to be appreciated. The first is that&mdash;in one sense overtly, but in another sense by sleight of hand&mdash;the government is very seriously denuding the amount of funds available as incentives to private industry for infrastructure investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The program that was in place under the former government was in the order of $200 million. The government asserts, in the course of its budget propaganda, for want of a better description, that the replacement program is in the order of $75 million. It is $75 million by the end of the fourth outlay year. In the first two years, it is $37.5 million. So what you see in terms of a commitment by the government to give private industry incentives to engage in the improvement of infrastructure by private capital investment, is that the incentive goes from about $200 million to $37.5 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second key point linked to this legislation is that when the Treasurer (Mr Costello) announced in September of 1996 and subsequently in February of this year the proposed changes to the particular infrastructure bonds program, he indicated that in this year's budget a replacement program would be designated. In addition to the serious denuding of the funds available, there is a very clear public policy error that has been made by the government in restricting the program in the future to road and rail infrastructure only.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Wearing my shadow minister for resources and energy cap, what this does is effectively knock out any energy or power projects. It knocks out any gas pipeline infrastructure. It knocks out any power co&hyphen;generation plant 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4391"> proposal or project. Why is that important? Why is that an important point to make? Why is doing that of adverse consequences to Australia's economic development? Why does it have such adverse consequences to the prospects for investment, prosperity and employment in the future?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things that on this side of the House we have continually been in favour of, is doing what we can as a government, as a nation, as a community, to maximise the capacity of Australia to engage in downstream processing. As might be expected, being the member for Perth, I grew up in Western Australia. Of all of the states Western Australia is the most rich in minerals and resources. For many years in the ALP in Western Australia we have been saying, `Why can't we go from digging it up and shipping it offshore to adding value and engaging in downstream processing?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the years a number of reasons have been given to me. One in the 1970s and 1980s was: because the dollar was regulated it was impossible to make the long-term commitments. The dollar is now no longer regulated. In the eighties people used to say to me the reason that downstream processing is so difficult, so hard, is the cost of energy. If you bring the cost of energy down, if you bring the price of energy down, then we have a chance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you ask people in a minerals commodity industry who do engage in downstream processing, `How can you downstream process,' they say a range of things, but you can crystallise them in the following ways. Firstly, they say, `There is no magic wand.' I agree with that; there is no magic wand. Secondly, they say that a lot depends on the market and the margins, and that is understandable. Then they will talk about infrastructure. You cannot get a quality resource project going unless you have a number of things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, you need the quality resource. Then you need access to it. Then you need the infrastructure to develop it. So infrastructure is important. Then they will say to you, `If you want to go from a quality resource, having access to it, digging it up, to add value 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to it, the next important thing is the cost of energy.' What have we been trying to do over the years?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have been trying to bring down the cost of energy. In my own state, in Western Australia, we have seen the development of the Dampier to Bunbury gas pipeline linked to the North West Shelf joint venture partners liquefied natural gas plant. What we have seen in recent days in Western Australia is a decision by the state government to sell the gas pipeline and in the year commencing 2001 open up the opportunity or the possibility of a second gas pipeline from the north-west of Western Australia to the south.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the state government has probably got it about 75 to 85 per cent right. If I had a quibble with the decision announced recently by the state resources development minister, Colin Barnett, it would be that he should have allowed invitations or expressions of interests for the construction of a second pipeline immediately, not hold it back until the year commencing 2001.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is in a sense an aside. The key point is that that decision has been made in the main with bipartisan support because that will lead to the reduction of the cost of energy. Competition and open access to that energy supply will bring the costs down. Why is that important? Why is it important to have cheaper gas coming from the north west of Western Australia to the south west? It is not just the north west of Western Australia that is resource rich; the south west of Western Australia is also resource rich. The cost of gas is important to the alumina and bauxite industry, which we also find in the south&hyphen;west of Western Australia, and it is important to the mineral sands industry, which we also find in the south&hyphen;west of Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The alumina and bauxite industry of Western Australia effectively takes up&mdash;and I am happy to be corrected on the precise figure&mdash;about 10 per cent of the world market. It is a world class quality industry. The mineral sands industry of Western Australia is regarded by very many of its competitors as the world leader. If we want to go further, if we want to make sure that we keep that world market share, if we want to try to do better, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4392"> then one thing that is important to both of those industries is the cost of energy and the cost of infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The same occurs in Queensland. I am not as familiar with the Queensland situation as I am with Western Australia&mdash;but it will not be too long before I am, let me assure my Queensland colleagues. After Western Australia, Queensland is the state which is the next most resource rich. What do we find in Queensland? If you take the area around Mount Isa you find an area which is rich in world class base metal commodities&mdash;zinc, lead, copper and some gold. Mount Isa has been a world class facility for a number of years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We now find in Queensland a number of gas pipeline proposals. We have a proposal by AGL to build a gas pipeline from the Ballera gas station in the south&hyphen;west corner of Queensland feeding off the Santos field in South Australia from the Cooper Basin to build a pipeline to Mount Isa. That will bring cheaper energy to Mount Isa. That will enable continuing development of Mount Isa. It will also, by coincidence, enable Western Mining Corporation to establish a fertiliser plant using feedstock from the gas energy source. There you have a perfect example of the capacity of a cheaper energy source&mdash;a cheaper energy supply&mdash;and infrastructure to keep quality mineral resource projects going and also add some value through some downstream processing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Possibly the most promising in terms of its long-lasting ability to add to the potential of Queensland as a rich mineral resource state and to do downstream processing is the proposed Chevron gas pipeline from Papua New Guinea to Townsville and Gladstone. Why is that important? Well, if you get a cheap energy source going down to Gladstone, then Comalco has a chance of getting up its alumina refinery. You also have the Korea Zinc project in Townsville. There is an element of chicken and egg about all of this. Queensland has a chance of getting up those projects, but they are dependent on the cheap energy source. There is a prospect of getting the pipeline up, but that is linked to the demand which is linked to those projects.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why are these points important in the context of this bill? This bill sends a message from the government to private industry in this country, to the private investment community, to the minerals and resource industries, to downstream processors of those commodities and to manufacturing industry. It sends the message: `This is a government which does not believe there is a role for government in providing incentives for private enterprise to build infrastructure, linked to making energy costs cheaper, linked to downstream processing, linked to jobs, linked to exports.' That is the key here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What do we find? We find a slashing of the incentives to private enterprise from $200 million to effectively $37.5 million and we find the exclusion of the energy projects I have referred to. The chief executive of the Australian Gas Association, Mr Ian Woodward, wrote to me earlier this month, and he made some similar points. The letter states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the new Tax Rebate is capped at $75 million; with only $37.5 million available in 1997/98 it is likely that only a very limited number of proposals would actually gain access to the Tax Rebate (especially as $22 billion of infrastructure have current applications with the DAA).</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of even greater concern is the decision to limit new project applications to road and rail only. There is no justification to exclude other types of projects such as gas pipelines from the new Infrastructure Tax Rebate Program. The rationale for this approach is not provided nor understandable given Australia's substantial need for private sector investment in a wide array of infrastructure including energy projects.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Woodward goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your attention is drawn to a number of facts relating to the natural gas sector:</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The levels of projected gas demand, especially in states such as Queensland and New South Wales, require extensive new pipeline infrastructure to be built to provide supplies for the early part of next century.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Australia's gas infrastructure is relatively immature by world comparison. New infrastructure projects are required to facilitate interstate gas trade through an integrated grid, as well as to support the competitive and deregulated energy 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4393"> market envisaged under the Government's competition policy reforms.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Infrastructure is the key to this particular industry. Earlier this week, members may have noticed that the Australian Gas Association released its annual gas supply and demand study, which forecast a trebling of natural gas consumption in the period to 2030. It asserted&mdash;I think there is a lot of strength in it&mdash;that natural gas will be Australia's fastest growing energy source to 2030.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report also referred to the `critical and imminent need for investment decisions on long-term gas infrastructure projects, like pipelines'. At precisely that point in the cycle, where you want a commitment to infrastructure, where you want a commitment to lower energy costs, when there is a huge and growing demand and potential for gas as a feedstock for downstream processing, when the relevant association is saying, `We now need some long-term commitments made for investment in this infrastructure', the government knocks it out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of the $2.2 billion worth of potential projects which had approached the authority before or in the course of the Treasurer making his decisions, the government says, `We'll slip you $37.5 million, but only if you are road and rail. Forget about energy. Forget about co-generation power stations. Forget about downstream processing. Forget about infrastructure which will help develop rural and regional Australia. Forget about infrastructure which will assist in the creation of jobs and the development of Australia as a world-class minerals and resources nation with a greater capacity for downstream processing.' That is the approach that this particular bill takes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have referred to a couple of particular pipelines&mdash;the situation in Western Australia and Queensland. The central west pipeline proposal in New South Wales will also, I think, be adversely affected by this particular arrangement. It may well still go ahead, but it will probably go ahead on the basis of a six-inch gas pipeline rather than an eight-inch gas pipeline. Why is that important? That is important because if you have an eight-inch 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> gas pipeline through the central west you have some chance of getting gas to the New England area. So that pipeline will probably go ahead, but it will not go ahead with the quality that it could have had. That central west pipeline is a project which AGL is involved in. It will certainly mean that the New England region, particularly Tamworth, will not be fed with gas as it ought to be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a couple of co&hyphen;generation power station proposals which I think are worthy of mentioning in passing. The Redbank power station in the Hunter and Queensland's Oakey power station are projects which will potentially be adversely affected by what the government is proposing and for the reasons that I have outlined by providing cheaper energy and helping to ensure that industry, particularly the minerals and resources industry, has the capacity or the chance for downstream processing. These are all adverse consequences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I noticed that the Business Council of Australia, in its post-budget press release, had this to say about the government's decision on infrastructure bonds:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is nevertheless disappointed with the replacement measures announced in the Budget and views them as inequitable and likely to introduce unpredictability into the private sector provision of infrastructure. The inadequacy of the expenditure cap on the rebate and limiting the eligibility to road and rail projects brings into question the Government's vision of a competitive economy and the role the private sector is expected to play in providing and operating infrastructure in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is a pretty searing and damning indictment. For all the reasons that I have outlined, I associate myself with those remarks and associate myself with the remarks made by the member for Hotham, the shadow minister for industry, and I hope, subject to the timing of the debate, to be making a few technical remarks in the course of the consideration in detail stage.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that there are many in Australia who seek to hike back to the days of Snowy Mountain schemes and great infrastructure projects and the vision they say those projects played in Australia. In part, that is true, but in this day and age the Australian people have 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4394"> a huge debt to pay off which they did not participate in. I believe that job availability and opportunities for youth, the functionality of families and the capacity of families to exist, care for the aged, health costs and things like that are the main centres of focus for Australians. There is not really the same imperative in their outlook for large projects of the type of the Snowy Mountain project.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many elements of the remarks of the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) would lead us to think that the solution to many of Australia's problems are grand projects and grand infrastructure activity. In particular, I took him to say in his presentation that only with massive government intervention into Newcastle could some of those problems be solved. In my view, the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) made a very interesting speech because he seemed to distance himself from those remarks in a very basic and thoughtful manner. He was more realistic about the opportunities for Australia to take on large projects and really directed his attention to how we could achieve those projects using alternative methods rather than total government involvement and total government directed investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The debate in Australia is really: how do we as a nation achieve things without having to take money from taxpayers, put it into government coffers and then redirect it at government whim into projects that the government endorses? What we are really doing as a nation is drawing on the creativity, inventiveness and drive of the total Australian population rather than saying, as the Labor Party has traditionally said, that all of the brains, all of the brilliance, all of the drive and all of the direction for the future of Australia lies vested in Canberra amongst a few politicians. That is absolutely not true.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One has to go back only 14 or 15 months to see how untrue that is and to realise that all of the activity of the Australian Labor Party and the government of Paul Keating directed to new work opportunities, to Working Nation, to infrastructure bonds and all of those sorts of things could not produce anything but disastrous results. In fact, if all of those schemes had been successful, there would still 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> not have been enough capacity in Australia for us to take on large infrastructure projects and successfully carry them through. In fact, the member for Hotham and the Australian Labor Party are battling to identify successful projects that are related and that have been brought about by their activity and by the introduction of the infrastructure borrowing bonds process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 5 December 1995 I put it to the House&mdash;and I think I was the only one on my side or amongst all members of the House to say&mdash;that I believed that the decision to introduce infrastructure borrowing bonds was a bad decision by the government and was a decision which would lead to misdirection of resources. It did not favour any input from the marketplace or the needs of the country but really sought to provide a favoured treatment&mdash;a tax funded treatment&mdash;for projects that were dreamt up to gain a tax advantage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That has proved to be the case. It has been proved over the last three years that the proposal of the government of the day&mdash;the Labor Party&mdash;for infrastructure borrowings was a failure, simply because it left things so open that people were able to capitalise on the tax concessions in such a way that the infrastructure projects that were so dear to the heart of the Labor Party did not go ahead. Instead, the tax advantages flowed to people making investments and manipulating the funds. That is a shame, because their goal and their purpose were laudable enough, even though I believe misdirected. But it is a double penalty when your misdirected intentions fail, and the failure of the project has been rectified by the new government where the tax rorts have been cancelled out and a new process put in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time, however, I would like to point out to the House that the real benefits of the change of government can be seen in the figures coming through on the way in which new capital expenditure, new investment, is taking place in Australia today. One only has to look at the March quarter results of new capital expenditure to see that there has been a 40 per cent increase in the estimates of capital expenditure for this year.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4395">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I acknowledge that this is not people investing in every instance in big projects such as ports and gas pipelines, but it is people investing in income generating activity such as new plant and equipment, improvements to their offices, their factories and their farms. This is driving ahead the opportunity for Australians to take advantage of a better way of life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not government funded. Total business investment rose strongly in March, the quarter that we have just finished, to its highest level since the survey commenced in June 1987. So for the first time for a decade new capital investment is starting to rise to a level where it will generate growth, activity and opportunities for Australians in jobs and in expanded export opportunity, increased efficiency and productivity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is something that was not able to be achieved by huge concessions made to infrastructure borrowings and infrastructure funding. So one has to look at the total input to this nation to be able to ascertain precisely how well government policy is working.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Equipment spending has also reached its highest level since the survey began. Equipment spending is a pretty important aspect, because capital expenditure can include things like aircraft and other things which are imported, but the equipment spending is really the basis of new and future production. It does give an indication of confidence in the future for those making the investment. It does give an indication of the prospects for job improvement and for new opportunities for Australia. We now have had the third quarter of growth in capital expenditure and we have reached an historic high. That must continue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But at the same time as removing the rorts that were implicit and perfectly predictable in the previous government's infrastructure borrowing scheme this government has now introduced changes by introducing the infrastructure borrowing tax rebate&mdash;a much cleaner and easier way of giving a concession, if one needs to give concessions to large projects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly, the demands on the financier and the investor are more rigid than was previous 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ly the case. But I guess the thing that I applaud more than anything else is the accountability that has been built into the process by the current government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is all very well for the Australian Labor Party to say that there is a whole bunch of `what ifs?'&mdash;`What if we had done this?' or `Maybe if we had done something else we could have achieved more.' They had a chance for 13 years. It is the first time in 10 years that we have seen a big increase in capital expenditure, and now we have seen a sensible infrastructure borrowing scheme that can generate $2 billion worth of investment. The start&hyphen;up is $37 million, and in 1999 it will be $75 million&mdash;which will produce $2 billion worth of capital investment, because it will encourage the mix of private sector funds with the tax concession given by the Australian taxpayer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact of the matter is that, at the end of the day, if there were no concession of this type the Australian taxpayer would be $75 million better off. But I do believe that the $75 million is about all that Australians are prepared to pay in this day and age for infrastructure. Most of them are more concerned about their family circumstances and the prospects for their kids than they are about infrastructure. They do believe&mdash;and I endorse that thought&mdash;that the circumstances ought to be such that private enterprise is encouraged to do these things and not to have the hand of government on all advances Australia wants to make.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we took the rorts out of the system, there was a cry from the Labor Party. I participated in that debate and pointed out to them that they were wrong again. It did not seem to make any difference to the member for Hotham, who keeps raving about Newcastle and whether ministers should go up there or not. It is purely a political process; he is not applying his mind to the future needs of the nation. I think that the member for Perth and other members in this chamber are providing a very welcome intellectual input to this process, and I want to compliment them on that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I hope they subsume those ahead of them, because I think that the attempt at that sort of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4396"> political point scoring by the member for Hotham just does not really cut the mustard, because it does not really register with the people of Newcastle. They understand the circumstances and they know that he is engaged in political point scoring, because it was his policies that brought about the circumstances we have today in Newcastle. What he is proposing, I think, in some nebulous way, is some rescue package which was tried time and time again by the Australian Labor Party when they were in office and failed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we first brought changes to this process and the House debated the Infrastructure Certificate Cancellation Tax Bill, I pointed out to the House that, if we were going to give concessions, they needed to be directed. By the proposals announced in the budget, they are well directed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Treasurer (Mr Costello) gave good notice of this. There can be no claim by the Australian Labor Party that there should be greater support for private provision of infrastructure; nor should there be any claim that infrastructure borrowings, applications pending or anything like that have been harshly dealt with because they have all been taken care of within the budget process. For a simple outlay of $75 million, the eligible categories for new public infrastructure are road and rail projects and their related facilities, the projects that had applications for infrastructure borrowings pending at the time of the 14 February announcement and extensions of projects that had previously been certified for infrastructure borrowings use. It is a perfectly reasonable transitional arrangement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other condition that applies, and it is an important one, is that only genuine private sector proponents who provide new public infrastructure will be able to access the tax rebate. Private sector proponents will be able to access the rebate only if they pass the tests contained in section 51AD and division 16D of the Income Tax Assessment Act. It is a proper, rigorous approach: are the funds really going to be used for the purposes for which the investors say they will be used? Therefore, we have the accountability process built 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> back into the system. It is reasonable, it is directed and it is focused. It meets the needs for infrastructure activity, particularly within the categories of rail and road, because if there is any impediment in the cost structure of Australia today to our capacity to compete it is the infrastructure costs related to transportation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We suffer huge penalties for the distances that our goods have to be moved, and then, having moved them around within Australia, there is the cost of transhipping them overseas if they are being exported. So the directed approach being taken by the government is logical in light of the stage we are at, in light of our development and needs and the neglect that has occurred over the years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People have said in this House, `If only you could build a railway line from Adelaide to Darwin many of our problems would be solved.' The line is halfway there, but the problems are not half solved, so I think a rigorous economic test needs to be applied to this process, and that is what the government has said it will do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to stage 2 of this proposal, only projects which have fully satisfied the requirements of stage 1&mdash;that is, rail and road, in transition and genuine private investment met&mdash;and have satisfied additional assessments as to the viability of the project from a commercial feasibility viewpoint will be assessed. Therefore, there will not be a rebate for those projects which are pie&hyphen;in&hyphen;the&hyphen;sky sorts of ideas that may attract a tax concession but which will not produce results. We are not going to have jojoba sorts of activities or the psychedelic ostrich farm type investments that are so speculative in rail and road. They will not be part of this government's regime. They will have to pass the viability test, and I think that is a reasonable thing for the government to require.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to the extent to which the project should not proceed without the rebate, another test that will be applied is whether there is a need for a rebate. Could the commercial investors go ahead without taxpayer support is one of the questions that they will have to answer. The extent to which the tax benefits arising from the rebate flow to the infrastructure 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4397"> proponent is also significant because we will not be allowing investors to reap the benefit; the tax concessions must be directed into the nuts and bolts, the bricks and mortar, of the project so that the project itself gains the benefit. In practical terms it means that, if under normal circumstances you can build 10 kilometres of freeway without the rebate, you ought to be able to build 12 or 15 kilometres of freeway with the rebate. So the advantage of the tax rebate will be directed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I welcome this change because it is starting to get things back on the road. But I do draw the attention of the House to the fact that this important measure&mdash;now well directed, now under control&mdash;is linked to private sector capital investment. It is only when the two go together that we will get a real multiplication factor in the capacity of Australia because some concession for infrastructure&mdash;for roads and rail and maybe other things eventually&mdash;may be needed from government. I really believe that the true emphasis is on giving people who have goals and visions of their own a capacity to do what they want. That can only come from a healthy economy where people are content and forward looking, not from a regressive, overtaxed, restricted economy with a huge debt around its neck. That is the direction this government is taking the nation&mdash;not to debt but to success and profit.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was extraordinary to hear the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), in this debate on the Taxation Laws Amendment (Infrastructure Borrowings) Bill, express his opposition to infrastructure bonds on the basis that they come from a philosophy that all wisdom resides in Canberra, as though infrastructure bonds were some kind of socialist plot, when anyone who studies the issue understands that the purpose of infrastructure bonds is to facilitate private investment in infrastructure&mdash;which, until now, has been traditionally conducted by governments. Governments have built roads, railways, airports and the like.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The express purpose of the infrastructure bonds has been to enable private sector investment in those projects. So to endeavour to characterise them as some kind of socialist plot really is laughable. But I guess the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> member for Mitchell had to contribute something different from his previous contributions on this issue. Last year, when the House was debating the Development Allowance Authority legislation and considering similar issues, the member for Mitchell said that people:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . are sick of having one million unemployed. They are sick of a bankruptcy level where around 12,000 or 14,000 companies go bust a year. They are sick of Australia having a record foreign debt . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">You would not want to mention that this year&mdash;unemployment has gone up, bankruptcies have gone up by over 20 per cent and foreign debt has gone up. So we did not hear anything from the member for Mitchell about unemployment, bankruptcies or foreign debt, and I do not expect that we will this year. It will be interesting to do a word search and find how many government members mention unemployment, bankruptcies or foreign debt this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Taxation Laws Amendment (Infrastructure Borrowings) Bill pulls out the rug from under infrastructure bonds. I believe that a lack of support for infrastructure means that we have stopped looking ahead to the 21st century. To pull out the rug from under infrastructure investments is typical of this government's lack of vision. It is a small&hyphen;minded government with a small&hyphen;minded Prime Minister, totally lacking the vision of former Prime Minister Keating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is something that must be seen in the context of the government's withdrawal from research and development, its withdrawal from export market development grants, from DIFF, from regional development and the cuts in higher education places. All of these things add up to a lack of industry policy and a lack of vision for Australia in the next century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Treasurer (Mr Costello) calls every tax concession, every measure of industry policy, a tax rort. This was the same strategy used in the termination of the research and development syndication arrangements and the superannuation surcharge. Certainly, there are some problems with high income earners and financiers abusing the infrastructure bond system. That is why, as Treasurer, the mem 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4398"> ber for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) announced specific anti&hyphen;avoidance provisions to counter these schemes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The infrastructure bond arrangements were carefully designed by Labor to ensure that they could not involve large-scale rorting as the cost to the revenue was capped by regulation. The limits were set at $150 million for 1996&hyphen;97 and $200 million for 1997&hyphen;98. Indeed, it was precisely these provisions that the Treasurer invoked in September last year when he suspended the operation of the infrastructure bond arrangements for 1996&hyphen;97.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This proposal is a dramatic overreaction. If the infrastructure bond system was being rorted, the system should be tightened up, not abolished. The Treasurer acknowledged that not all applicants for infrastructure bond certification were rorting the system. Nevertheless, Labor will be cooperative and agree to pass the legislation. Clearly, if the government is not prepared to provide any money to fund it, it is difficult to do otherwise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But there are transitional problems. As a result of the termination of the infrastructure bond arrangements, a number of important national projects have now been thrown into doubt by the action of the Treasurer. Labor is concerned to ensure that major new infrastructure projects are facilitated and believes that the government has an obligation to ensure that these projects become a reality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's mooted new arrangements for infrastructure need to be adequate to ensure that genuine projects that have been in the pipeline and are now in limbo in terms of infrastructure bonds are not unfairly disadvantaged. Important regional development projects in the Hunter Valley and in Queensland which were very close to certification have now been threatened, thereby threatening the jobs growth and regional development accompanying those projects. Labor's amendments are designed to achieve certainty in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to take the House back to the debate on these issues at the time of the Development Allowance Authority amendments. Some people, I dare say, have short memories and need to be reminded of this discussion. The Treasurer was asked questions 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> by government members&mdash;referred to as dorothy dixers&mdash;about infrastructure bonds. In his response to those questions, Treasurer Costello complained about the Labor Party opposing infrastructure bonds for urban road projects. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is an opposition that, out of pure spite and without any principle whatsoever, is trying to place at risk 18 projects in the mining industry; 10 in the tourism industry; six in electricity, gas and water; four in manufacturing; and three in transport and storage.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He complained that we were trying to prevent $2.5 billion worth of projects going ahead. He said there was no basis on which he could excise one object of those infrastructure borrowings. He described Labor as `destroying job opportunities for Australians'. This was said when we were proposing to cut infrastructure bonds for urban roads. We now find the Treasurer killing off the whole scheme. What does that say about him?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was asked a question by the member for Cook (Mr Mutch), to which he responded that the government was determined to allow developers of urban road projects to proceed with certainty. The Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) was also asked a question from the government side, to which he responded as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This government has also reintroduced infrastructure bonds to enable the private sector to fund roads around Australia such as the eastern distributor in Sydney announced by the New South Wales government only last week. What did the previous government do? The previous Labor government axed infrastructure bonds for roads.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Oh dear! Just three weeks after the Minister for Transport and Regional Development made that observation, the Treasurer announced, on 12 September, that there would be no further applications for infrastructure bonds entertained or considered, completely pulling the rug out from under the minister for transport. He also indicated that at the conclusion of the current financial year the opportunities would open again in relation to infrastructure bonds. We can now see that he was wrong again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year the opposition explained its position concerning infrastructure bonds for urban road projects. But I want to go through 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4399"> that issue again because I think it is important that the House and the community have a proper understanding of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We were concerned that the urban road projects being funded and supported through infrastructure bonds were having a number of effects which were totally inappropriate in terms of good public policy. We had a report from the EPAC task force on private sector infrastructure which expressed some concern about infrastructure bonds, but in particular they were critical of the use of infrastructure bonds for urban roads. They did that because they said that both the transaction costs and the regulatory risks were higher when private sector capital was used to build this infrastructure than would be the case where there was the normal development of roads by way of public sector borrowings and contracting out of the actual construction arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They noted the additional substantial costs of raising capital, the legal costs involved in putting together financial arrangements, and the financial consultant costs, which were millions of dollars. They found that the legal and financial costs involved in putting together the overall financial plan was a much more expensive business where private sector capital was involved than was the case with the public sector and that there was considerable regulatory risk. The operation of a private sector road in association with a public sector network of roads introduces diseconomies and the need to make sure that the private sector road was profitable and did not fall over.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is precisely what we have seen in Melbourne with the City Link project: you have traffic being funnelled into the toll road to make sure that that project is viable, at the expense of the public sector roads that have been built and funded by taxpayers that are operating around it. With City Link we have Footscray Road, a major road into the city, being downgraded to two lanes in each direction between the Flinders Street extension and Dudley Street, Boundary Road being downgraded to one lane in each direction, Batman Avenue being absolutely closed west of the Morrell Bridge and the bridge itself being closed in Anderson Street, Alexandra 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Avenue being downgraded to one lane in each direction&mdash;and so on. You have this whole series of road narrowings or closures around the centre of Melbourne in order to funnel traffic into City Link. In my view, that is an absurd piece of public policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was extraordinary to read the response of the then minister for roads in the Victorian parliament to these changes. He was telling motorists that they had to pay a toll on the freeway now because it was a new freeway and it has been widened from four lanes to eight, and that is a great thing. The minister said that Footscray Road, which has been narrowed from eight lanes to four, could become a nice boulevard. No doubt it could, but it is designed to serve a transport purpose. If you want to follow that sort of logic through, then Tullamarine Freeway itself could become a nice boulevard too and be cut in half. It is an absurd piece of transport planning. We have been able to see the way the City Link project has operated in practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently, the Macquarie Bank indicated in a report to its shareholders that it had made a $36 million profit from the financing of the City Link project. I also note that Macquarie Bank made a $60,000 donation in 1995&hyphen;96 to the Liberal Party, as reported by its federal secretariat&mdash;a pretty good investment. But it is hard for me, or anyone else, to comprehend how the Macquarie Bank making $36 million clear profit for its shareholders is of benefit to the motorists whose road tolls for City Link are paying for that profit, or how this benefits the taxpayers who are subsidising that profit in terms of the concessional taxation treatment of infrastructure bonds. In my view, it is not the purpose of roads to make profits for Macquarie Bank shareholders and that shows up the failure of this kind of arrangement in so far as it applies to urban roads.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we see the City Link project unfold, all kinds of other adverse externalities appear. For example, there are residents in Strathmore and Pascoe Vale, living near the Tullamarine Freeway, who now have the `For Sale' signs out on their houses. There is no question that, with the City Link works going on right next door to them, they will suffer a substantial 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4400"> financial penalty in trying to sell their homes at this time. A number of residents are still trying to sell their homes, which reflects just how concerned they are at the noise coming from the construction work going on now and at how close the widened freeway will be to their homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been statements made to local newspapers by residents in, for example, Loeman Street, Strathmore. One said that his house was mainly on the market because of noise fears. Residents in that street, which backs onto the freeway, believed that they were going to be getting five&hyphen;metre barriers when, in fact, they are now going to be half that size. Ironically, there are residents in Pascoe Vale South, in Greenbank Crescent, who either have or want to put their homes on the market because of noise barriers which in their case are proposed to be 11 metres high. I am told that 11 metres is higher than the Berlin Wall and will in fact block out the sun and reduce their street to a cold, damp hole. Here we have a lot of externalities coming from the City Link project which these people have to put up with. As the construction works are proceeding, they go on very loud and clear, very close to students at Strathmore secondary college. It is a matter of concern to me that those VCE students are now preparing for their mid&hyphen;year exams under those conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What have we got now? We have got a government which, having criticised us for our position on infrastructure bonds for urban roads, has decided to terminate the whole scheme. We have before us a bill which proposes to terminate the infrastructure borrowing scheme announced by Labor and introduced by Labor as part of the One Nation statement. Private investors had long complained that the tax system was biased against private provision of infrastructure, so Labor listened and introduced this scheme as a result. It has assisted private sector involvement in infrastructure projects by modifying the tax system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sheer size of a lot of infrastructure projects worth hundreds of millions or billions of dollars has meant that no Australian company has been big enough to undertake that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> project on its own. It is generally commercially advantageous to have partners who provide expertise in various specialist aspects of the project, for example, financiers, construction, engineering services and so on. It is natural that those projects are undertaken by consortia, and these projects then do have considerable taxation problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that the principle has been of substantial value in this community. We have supported it accordingly. We believe that the government is substantially overreacting. It is a major blow to regional Australia to find these projects potentially being cancelled. More than $21 billion worth of substantial infrastructure projects are now in danger, something like 147 projects which had been lodged with the Development Allowance Authority: 44 in New South Wales, 23 in Victoria, 38 in Queensland, 23 in Western Australia, 10 in South Australia and four in Tasmania. A substantial number of projects have been put in jeopardy as a result of this decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for the government's replacement scheme announced in the budget, I draw the attention of the House to the response of the Australian Constructors Association, which says:</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">INFRASTRUCTURE REBATE SCHEME LACKS VISION</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I listened with interest if also with exasperation to the carping negativity of the member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson), who has brought to the debate, in his own words, a `damp squib'. There is a good story to tell in the provision of privately financed infrastructure in this country. It is an exciting and important story and it is one that this government will have an intimate and ongoing commitment to over the months, years and I hope decades ahead.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Infrastructure comprises those key assets of the community which make the economy as a whole much more efficient. They are the core assets of power, water, roads, rail, ports and airports. If you look at their place and importance in the evolution of nations and indeed civilisations, you could certainly argue that the provision of quality infrastructure has been one of the secrets to the quality of life which all of us enjoy today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The historian Paul Johnson in his book the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Birth of the Modern</EMPHASIS> writes about John McAdam, the man who discovered how to make good roads cheaply, and suggests that `this was one of the magical keys to modernity'. McAdam was a road builder and an engineer. Besides his practical gifts as an engineer he also had a gift for financing and for working out how to fund the community's demand for ever better infrastructure. He organised the communities of England into small trusts which were responsible for raising the money for the construction and ongoing maintenance of the roads. He had a practical genius that extended in this area of financing, for example, to the construction of high quality toll booths which allowed the government and the local municipalities to employ a more honest citizen to collect the tolls and thereby preserve a greater proportion of the revenues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Johnson goes on in his analysis of the impact of infrastructure and the building of modern states to an assessment of the contribution of Thomas Telford, the poet, architect, engineer and bridge and canal builder. He describes Telford as the `supreme engineer&hyphen;architect of the sublime'. He gives him the highest praise of anyone in his 1,200&hyphen;page book when he says of Telford, `He was perhaps the most remarkable man of all in an age of great men.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The thing about Telford and McAdam is that they were building on a road network which was pre&hyphen;established in the Roman period. The expression `All roads lead to Rome' has a literal as well as a metaphorical dimension, and the reality is that the world's first truly imperial power was based upon the capacity of the Romans to project power over long distances at high speed through the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4402"> Roman road network. Likewise, the Roman propensity for the building of sewerage systems, aqueducts and those fundamental services which lift the whole quality of life of the citizenry was in no small part responsible for the emergence of Rome as the world's first great imperial state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The thing about infrastructure is its fundamentally democratic quality. Its impact is on the living standards of the whole community, not on those of some elite few. For example, an Australian family on average weekly earnings today would enjoy considerably higher levels of mobility, domestic convenience, safety, hygiene and health than the most exalted member of the landed aristocracy a century or two ago. The rise in life expectancy around the world, especially in the more developed countries, is in no small part due to the quality of the infrastructure that serves the community as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Infrastructure, particularly private infrastructure, has other benefits. For example, in Australia it is building depth in our equity markets, which to date have been regrettably thin and lacking in diversity. It is providing investors with a new class of investment which has the characteristics of a tradeable fixed interest security, and it builds a sense of ownership and entrepreneurship among the working people of this nation. The private infrastructure experience of Australia to date, which has been considerable, is likewise building the nation's export capability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that the previous speaker, the member for Wills, was critical of the Macquarie Bank for its contribution to the campaign funds of the Liberal Party. I note with interest that one of the largest individual donors to the Australian Labor Party is the Transfield group. I do not bring a kind of cynical imputation of bad faith or poor motives to Transfield. I regard it as one of Australia's great corporations. Both in the past and in its more recently divided form, doing both defence and civil engineering works, it has made a fantastic contribution to the development of this country's infrastructure and, in this present context, importantly the infrastructure of the emerging nations of the region around us.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note, for example, the much discussed Friendship Bridge in Laos which was brought about with great assistance from former Prime Minister Hawke, but nonetheless it is merely one example. Transfield is building bridges and power stations all over Asia, largely on the back of its experience in the delivery of privately financed infrastructure in Australia. If you take another construction company, CMPS&amp;F, it now has a thousand employees around Australia. On the basis of its experience in building the M4 toll road in Sydney, which was privately financed, and currently the waste treatment plant at Lidcombe, it is active in the countries of Thailand, Indonesia, China, Kiribati and Papua New Guinea, taking with it the expertise that it gained in the delivery of infrastructure here in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you take a market like China, the world's largest infrastructure market, one project alone, the Three Gorges Dam, will cost $18 billion to construct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was delighted when the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) announced yesterday that a third Australian law firm, Blake Dawson Waldron, had been granted a licence to practise law in China. That firm is jointly sponsoring an institute called the Australia China Centre for BOT Research with the East China University of Politics and Law. That is a critical step forward because we are profiling Australian expertise in this area of privately funded infrastructure&mdash;build-operate-transfer infrastructure&mdash;in the largest infrastructure market in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sponsoring of that study centre follows the award by the World Bank of a contract to an Australian lawyer, Mr Larry Jackson of Blake Dawson Waldron, to advise China's Ministry of Finance on the writing of model BOT contracts for tolled highways throughout China. Likewise, the firm has been appointed by the United Nations International Development Organisation to advise the State Planning Commission of China on the formation of model contracts for privately financed water treatment plants. We are witnessing here the accumulation of expertise in privately financed infrastructure projects in this country providing a powerful springboard for the projection of Australian exports, particularly 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4403"> the export of services and brain power into the region around us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Infrastructure is one of those sectors that unequivocally requires leadership on the part of governments. That is so as a product of this democratic quality of infrastructure. Inevitably, in the construction phase you have a small number of people who are quite adversely affected by the construction process but also a huge number of the community who will benefit but in a much more diffuse way. In terms of the democratic dynamic, that involves huge amounts of protests and obstruction in the construction and development phase of infrastructure, but huge benefits after the project has actually been completed. The result is that, unless you have strong leadership by governments, you can wind up in a situation where the community has a kind of infrastructure gridlock where nothing can get built. As a result, the progress of the community can be substantially retarded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Something like the building of a second airport in Sydney is a classic example of this. As someone in the affected electorate of Parramatta, I see all of the communities mobilising and the quality of the debate getting increasingly irrational, and my biggest fear is not of one outcome or the other but that there might be no outcome&mdash;that the level of community objection to a second airport, wherever sited, may be so high that we simply will not have a second airport. You will not have hundreds of thousands of people protesting in the streets over that outcome, but you will find increasingly over the next decade that opportunities for Sydney will pass us by. Opportunities for employment in western Sydney will be lost to Brisbane and Melbourne but, more particularly, to our regional neighbours in Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Hong Kong and Shanghai. We must have the courage to bite the bullet and provide the real leadership necessary to deliver these infrastructure projects which, as I say, serve the community as a whole and the economy as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This piece of legislation is a tightening up, a reform, of the previous scheme. It follows the introduction of a tax preference infrastructure borrowing allowance in the 1992 One 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Nation program. Many of the benefits of the infrastructure borrowings program have gone to infrastructure projects around Australia in exactly the way the scheme was intended. I could cite, for example, the M2 motorway&mdash;which services the northern boundary of my electorate&mdash;or the Eastern Distributor toll road in Sydney, the Smithfield, Osborne and Collinsville power stations and Melbourne's City Link project, all of which were fairly orthodox expressions of the infrastructure borrowings program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the Treasurer (Mr Costello) rightly recognised that, due to the sloppy drafting of the previous legislation, loopholes had emerged and that the scheme was being used for purposes which were beyond the intent of the original legislation. The Treasurer has taken the appropriate step of tightening up the terms of the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that, I am not one of those who is critical of the private sector for their conduct in this regard. I regard the energy, the innovation and the commitment to efficiency and to finding every possible competitive edge, which is a feature of the private economy, as being one of its strengths and providing a source of energy and power which drives the whole community&mdash;indeed the whole civilisation&mdash;forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that regard, I am an advocate of the view more eloquently expressed by Sir Garfield Barwick as Chief Justice of the High Court, formerly Attorney-General in this place and, in my view, his most distinguished role of all, as federal member for Parramatta. Sir Garfield was an advocate of the principle that individuals are not under any kind of obligation to implement or uphold government policy in relation to taxation. Their obligation is to uphold the law and they are entirely at liberty to minimise their tax obligations to government so long as they uphold the law. I would like to quote from Sir Garfield's judgment in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v. Westraders Pty Ltd in 1979. In that judgment Sir Garfield stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because of the employment of the provisions of the Act to produce a very large diminution of tax, the case affords an occasion to point out the respective functions of the parliament and of the courts in relation to the imposition of taxation. It 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4404"> is for the parliament to specify, and to do so, in my opinion, as far as language will permit, with unambiguous clarity, the circumstances which will attract an obligation on the part of the citizen to pay tax. The function of the court is to interpret and apply the language in which the parliament has specified those circumstances. The court is to do so determining the meaning of the words employed by the parliament according to the intention of the parliament which is discoverable from the language used by the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Importantly, Sir Garfield concludes by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not for the court to mould or to attempt to mould the language of the statute so as to produce some result which it might be thought the parliament may have intended to achieve, though not expressed in the actual language employed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">One could extend the logic to the role and duty of the citizen which, in my view, approaches a moral duty to minimise his or her tax obligations. Sir Garfield concluded by saying that this principle `is basic to the maintenance of a free society'. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the freedom to choose the form of transaction into which he shall enter is basic to the maintenance of a free society.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Our task is to draft laws with sufficient clarity and specificity to ensure that the purpose and the intention of the act is fulfilled and not to require the citizenry, if you like, to second&hyphen;guess our intention and to uphold the policy of the government. So I regard it as an entirely appropriate response by the Treasurer to now step in and fill the void created by the drafting of the former government to produce a scheme which actually effects its intended result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Infrastructure is worthy of special treatment under our tax system for all the reasons I have outlined and because of the particular financing characteristics of infrastructure as a class of transaction. I note that infrastructure, by very definition, is capital intensive and involves a long-term revenue stream. Many infrastructure projects do not become tax positive until after 10 years of operation. The M2 motorway just completed took 2&half; years to construct with a capital cost of about $600 million. Over 2&half; years the sponsor consortium, the proponents, were constantly expending resources, but they had no revenue against which to claim the tax deduction.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose of the scheme, therefore, is to produce greater tax symmetry among the players in these major infrastructure projects and, as the member for Wills rightly pointed out, to reflect the fact that Australia does not have a sufficient number of BHPs, large corporations, which have within their own umbrella sufficient diversity of sources of revenue in order to be able to cross&hyphen;match the favourable tax treatment of their losses on one project with their revenues on another.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It underlines the fact that big is not necessarily bad. Australia needs some major corporations with deep pockets and substantial industrial muscle. If we had more of those corporations, we would not be so reliant on measures such as this&mdash;nonetheless a necessary measure considering the lack of maturity and the lack of capital depth of Australian commercial organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Governments of all persuasions have demonstrated a reluctance to invest in infrastructure to the level required by the community. That is why we are looking more and more to the private sector to step in and take up the slack. I want to congratulate the private sector players in Australian infrastructure who, in my view, have done an exceptional job in delivering this higher quality of life to all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's ongoing commitment of about $75 million a year worth of tax concessions is a substantial one. Had we been left in a stronger fiscal position by the previous administration we would no doubt have made a more generous contribution, but when you are wrestling with $100 billion worth of Commonwealth debt on a budget of $140 billion, one's room to move is considerably circumscribed. So I do not apologise for the apparent modesty of the scheme. In terms of our current fiscal position, it in fact reflects a very substantial commitment by this government to the development of privately financed infrastructure in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I salute and congratulate the private proponents of infrastructure throughout Australia. I congratulate them on their success in taking that expertise into our regional markets. I congratulate the Treasurer on what is a measured, judicious, appropriate reform, but  none

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating today the amendments to the Development Allowance Authority Act and the Income Tax Assessment Act, which will have the effect of winding up the tax concession provided for infrastructure borrowings. This particular measure dates back to the former government, particularly to its One Nation statement, which was issued in 1992, and the measure was further extended in the Working Nation statement in 1994. It formed a key element in those two statements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the time of One Nation and Working Nation most attention was given to the labour market measures to assist the unemployed, but both those statements contained substantial other components dealing with the economic needs of the country and stimulating investment and infrastructure, both through this sort of proposal to encourage private investment in infrastructure and through direct public investment in infrastructure, which was a key part of that. The rationale there was both a short&hyphen;term one, to provide a cyclical boost through capital investment when we were experiencing a recession, and also there was an acknowledgment involved there that as a country we needed to investment more in infrastructure. There were certain features of the way in which our budgetary accounting conventions operated, which provided a disincentive, particularly to public investment in infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Infrastructure investment is very important from the point of view of national economic welfare. There is now some very substantial evidence that links growth in national economic productivity to adequate infrastructure provision. There has been a major study done in the United States covering particularly the Reagan years, which links a slowdown in productivity growth in that country over a period of about a decade to the running down of public infrastructure investment. It is very important, and I suppose the economists would say that there are substantial external benefits from investment in infrastructure; 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> these are benefits that a private investor might not entirely capture. For example, if you build a new road, the beneficiaries of building that road are not just those who use it but also the people who live on adjoining roads who experience a reduction in traffic or who use adjoining roads and consequently experience fewer delays as they go about their business and so forth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a whole raft of these sorts of external benefits from infrastructure investment, and I think it is clear that there is a significant case for public subsidy and public stimulus for infrastructure investment. As I said, that can take the form of either direct participation by the public sector through investing on its own account, or providing funds to other entities, whether they be state governments, for example&mdash;obviously, a proportion of general recurrent assistance to the states ends up being spent on infrastructure projects&mdash;or universities. Since we incorporated the capital program for universities into university operating grants back in 1994, a proportion of those funds obviously ends up on capital projects. So governments can directly stimulate and provide funds for capital investment. But what this concession sought to do was to increase the level of private sector investment in infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to look down the list of projects which are potentially affected by this. In my electorate, I am quite interested in the proposed extension to the light rail project, which will extend the network out to Leichhardt and Lilyfield. I think that is a proposal that has major benefits. It is a classic example again of where infrastructure investment produces external benefits. In this case, for example, there will be reduced traffic congestion and also reduced air pollution in a densely populated inner&hyphen;city area. That light rail project is costing around $170 million. I would hope that, under the replacement proposal which the government is putting up, which is confined to land transport projects, it would be able to continue to be supported. Nonetheless, it is a concern that there seems to be some doubt about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A few years ago the former member for Fraser, John Langmore, chaired a committee 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4406"> which looked at Australia's performance in public infrastructure investment. His committee produced a report which, in a sense, made rather depressing reading because it showed a steadily declining share of GDP being devoted to infrastructure projects. At the time, I think the member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis), who was then the Treasurer, argued as against that view that, to a substantial extent, that decline in public infrastructure investment as a proportion of GDP was offset by a growth in private infrastructure investment. There was a substitution in a number of areas over time. I think there is undoubtedly a substantial element of truth in that. What it does, I suppose, is highlight the importance of measures which are designed to foster and encourage private investment in infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In thinking about the volume and the extent of public infrastructure investment, one has to realise that the issue is not just the volume of funds going in but also how efficiently infrastructure is utilised. You have to ensure that you do not spend money on wasteful projects. To return to my own experience a couple of years ago with higher education, the separate higher education capital program funds were incorporated into the general recurrent operating grants provided to universities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The idea was to ensure that universities were able to contemplate different alternatives to achieve their teaching and research objectives. If they could achieve their objectives not by building a new building but by investing in some information technology infrastructure that might enable people to undertake studies at a distance, from home or from work, then we needed a structure of funding that provided every incentive for them to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In doing that, I think we ensured there was no wasteful use of infrastructure. Under the old schema, a major building project would be like manna from heaven. A university would be awarded this and would be able to spend money on it with no consideration of how effectively it would use it. It is very important that there be measures to ensure that infrastructure is well utilised. Obviously, the Hilmer type reforms and competition policy are, in part, about ensuring that.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at the overall structure of infrastructure investment, our budgetary conventions tend to provide an in&hyphen;built bias against direct public infrastructure investment because large, lumpy projects come off both the headline and the underlying deficit in the short term. There is no concept of amortisation of that investment. Hopefully, as the move is made to place the budgetary accounting framework on an accruals basis, that sort of distortion will tend to be diminished. For the time being, at least, there is that inherent factor biasing government decisions against an appropriate level of capital investment. Consequently, that means that part of the burden of ensuring an adequate level of such investment is taken up by the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now turn to the specific measures in the Taxation Laws Amendment (Infrastructure Borrowings) Bill, which, as I said at the outset, involve amendments to the Development Allowance Authority Act and the Income Tax Assessment Act to remove the infrastructure borrowings concession. I have indicated the history of this. It originated with the former government's One Nation and Working Nation statements. It was a key element in those statements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The object of the exercise was to provide a concession which would, in the first instance, go to lenders for infrastructure projects. But the intention was that the lenders would, in turn, pass on at least part of the benefit to borrowers through lower borrowing costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose it is reasonable to ask, given the substantial budgetary impact, whether it was effective. It is significant to note that the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) in his second reading speech points to the volume of projects which were under consideration. There were some 71 projects which potentially were worth $21.6 billion. That involved a significant revenue cost if they all ultimately got up. I think there is some indication that the measure was having a significant effect on infrastructure investment. To that extent, for the reasons I have already talked about, and given the factors which tend to lead to underinvestment in such infrastructure, I think that effect is probably a desirable one.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4407">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill obviously proposes to enact a decision to terminate the infrastructure borrowing scheme, which was introduced by Labor. Private investors had long complained that the tax system was biased against the private provision of infrastructure. Labor listened at the time and introduced the infrastructure borrowing scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The infrastructure borrowing scheme involves assisting private sector involvement in infrastructure projects by modifying the tax system. This private sector investment was historically impeded because the initial year's losses generated by most or all of the projects could not be offset against the other income of the investors, unless the project was undertaken by a single investor only as part of a wholly owned company group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sheer size of most infrastructure projects&mdash;worth either hundreds of millions or billions of dollars&mdash;meant that no Australian company was big enough to undertake the project on their own. It is generally commercially advantageous to have partners, as they provide expertise in various specialist aspects of the project&mdash;that is, financiers, construction, engineering services. It is natural that most projects would be undertaken by consortia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These projects would then confront the tax problem which I just mentioned. The infrastructure borrowing scheme overcame this problem by reducing the cost of infrastructure finance by effectively transferring the tax benefit of the tax deductibility of interest from the borrower to the lender. This was achieved by making the interest non-deductible to the borrower and either non-assessable to the lender or assessable but subject to a rebate equal to the company tax rate. This allowed a reduction of the rate of interest in that lenders charge borrowers for infrastructure projects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Projects were assessed by a statutory authority&mdash;the Development Allowance Authority, which is at arms-length from the government on their merit and according to statutory criteria. This system was starting to function very effectively as an incentive. There was leverage for significant projects which may not have been delivered for many years, if at 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> all, due to budgetary conditions in the public sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That said, there were some problems. For example, Labor announced that infrastructure borrowings would cease to be available for urban road projects from late 1995&mdash;a decision that was rejected by Treasurer Costello. Secondly, there is some evidence that aggressive tax planning was creeping into the marketing of infrastructure bonds at the retail level. These were matters that warranted being addressed by the government. However, the Treasurer's announcements in February were an overreaction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 14 February 1997, Treasurer Costello announced the government's intention to prevent the lodging of any new infrastructure bond applications, prevent the certification of any more projects under the infrastructure bond arrangements, including those currently before the certification authority&mdash;that is, the Development Allowance Authority&mdash;and terminate the right of variation of the conditions attaching to existing infrastructure bonds where the tax commissioner considers that this may cause an increased cost to the revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite literally, he cut the infrastructure bond program off at the knees. There were no warnings and no apologies to those who were not seeking to rort the system. No respect was given to the continuation of normal processing of applications. No thought was given to the impact of the decision on applicants, nor of the delays or the effect on the regions where the infrastructure is planned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the press conference the Treasurer also flagged that alternative arrangements for infrastructure would be announced in the 1997-98 budget. That new replacement program has now been announced and it is completely inadequate. I will return to this matter later in my remarks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The pretence under which the Treasurer acted was that there was a serious threat to the revenue. What he did not say was that there is already an effective mechanism to cap the revenue cost of the measure&mdash;indeed it is a measure that he himself invoked in September 1996. He then claimed that the provisions could be rorted. Labor has stated that we will 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4408"> support any clamp down on rorts, and we will, but the complete cessation of the program is an overreaction. At the press conference the Treasurer stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Development Allowance Authority has received legal advice to say that it is not able to refuse certification on the grounds that they are providing undue tax benefits and, as a result, the Government will enact legislation effective from midday today which will prevent any of those applications being certified.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Instead of saying that the government will amend the law to grant a discretion to the DAA to reject any applications which are too `tax aggressive', the Treasurer used this as a pretence to shut down the whole scheme. This is despite the fact that Mr Costello specifically acknowledged at the same press conference:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I want to keep stressing not every IB scheme is like what I've described today. There are a lot of IB schemes which are straight up and down in accordance with the spirit and the letter of the law and you know they are people trying to do the right thing and they're getting good investment infrastructure. I want to stress that point.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This looks like another Costello con. If you want to obtain savings from a tax expenditure, claim that it is being rorted. Then do not simply tighten the scheme to address any problems; cut the scheme completely to produce savings. Then if anybody wishes to analyse the alleged problems or seeks actual evidence of the claimed rorting, assert that they are supporting tax avoidance. This was the model pursued with the research and development syndication concession and it is also being put in this case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite this overreaction, Labor does not seek to defeat this bill. We recognise that the government has made the announcement and that this has, in practice, been implemented. It has thrown the existing rules into chaos but we cannot now undo that chaos. That said, we are concerned about the need for transitional provisions to assist some genuine projects which were well advanced along the certification process, not aimed at rorting the tax system and going to provide desirable regional development opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is one of the key issues which has been considered by the Senate committee 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> which has examined the legislation. Why should people who have done the right thing be penalised? Why should Australia's reputation as a stable place to invest and do business be threatened as it has been in this instance? This is why we brought down a minority report to the Senate committee report. Which projects have now been threatened by cutting the scheme? I have mentioned the Sydney light rail extension, which is of particular interest to me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would now like to say a few things about the government's alternative scheme. The government's new scheme was announced in the budget. It was not announced with much fanfare because it is a pale imitation of the arrangements it seeks to replace. It is called the infrastructure borrowings tax rebate. But it really should not be so broadly characterised. It is not a general scheme to assist the provision of private infrastructure in Australia. It is only targeted at land transport projects, although those projects which were left in limbo on 14 February are allowed to apply. This limitation seems extraordinary given that in the same budget we are told that for the savings rebate it is wrong to favour any one type of saving and we must benefit all types equally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the administration has been transferred to the tax commissioner from the DAA. Whilst Labor has no problem with the involvement of the tax commissioner on tax specific matters, I am not sure what expertise the commissioner will bring to the question of infrastructure. Indeed, I wonder if the commissioner actually wants yet another area of responsibility on top of his considerable current responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third area of change will be reduction in the rate of concession that will be available to superannuation funds and other taxpayers that face lower nominal rates of tax than the company tax rate. Labor had specifically made IBs more attractive to super funds through the 36 per cent rebate option. This was working in attracting finance from super funds into infrastructure. These changes may put that trend at risk. It continues the inexplicable attack on superannuation that has been engaged in by this Treasurer.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4409">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fourth, and arguably the most important change, has been the totally inadequate funding allocated to the concession. The government is allocating $37.5 million in 1997&hyphen;98 and $75 million in subsequent years. This can be contrasted with the $200 million that Labor had allocated to our IB program. Clearly, many or most of the projects which have been left in limbo will not fit into the tiny allocation. In any event, it appears that there will be no approval of projects under the new arrangements until 1 January 1998.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, we think what the government is proposing is a poor substitute for the arrangements that we had put in place and which the government intends to peremptorily terminate through the legislation that the House is currently debating.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the Taxation Laws Amendment (Infrastructure Borrowings) Bill 1997, the reasoning of the government for bringing this bill before the House has been well canvassed. But for the purpose of refreshing my own mind and that of the House, the infrastructure borrowings tax concession was introduced in 1992 in the One Nation statement and expanded in the 1994 Working Nation statement. We understand it is a way of reducing the costs of financing the construction of infrastructure projects. Lenders were eligible for a tax rebate of 36 per cent and the lenders would pass those benefits back to the project via a lower interest rate on the borrowings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Development Allowance Authority had the role of certifying all applications for the concession. We know that between 1994 to 30 June 1996 the DAA issued 12 certificates on borrowings totalling $4 billion. At 30 June 1996 it also had six applications still under consideration. But, in the six weeks before the 1996&hyphen;97 budget, the Development Allowance Authority received another 71 projects worth around $21.6 billion. If all these applications had been certified the loss in revenue would have exceeded $4 billion. Unfortunately the intent of the concession was undermined by tax aggressive financing arrangements and so some of those applications would see benefits flow not to projects but to financiers. There 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> fore, on 14 February this year, the Treasurer (Mr Costello) cancelled the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we know, the bill prevents the DAA issuing any certificates past 14 February 1997, but where a project has been told by the DAA that it would be eligible on certain criteria, it may still issue a certificate. The bill also takes into account variations on existing certificates. The introduction of the infrastructure borrowing tax rebates has been well canvassed. A maximum cost to the budget of $75 million per annum, including running costs, has been allocated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This afternoon I propose to go through some of the Labor Party's record on infrastructure and have a look at the practical reality of investment on the ground at the end of the day&mdash;getting the product onto the ship or onto the shelves and employing people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One issue of particular interest to my part of the world is the Alice Springs to Darwin railway. If we look at the previous Labor government's record on that issue&mdash;we well recall that the Fraser government was going to build it&mdash;we see that the then leader of the Labor Party, in campaign mode, came to the Northern Territory and made a special television commercial in which he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Territorians, you can trust me. The Australian Labor Party is the only party that will build the Alice Springs to Darwin railway.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is history that Mr Hill was commissioned to write a report, which sought to prove that the railway was not viable and to give the government of the day a way to not proceed. Of course, that is what happened. Over the 13 years of Labor's rule, that matter was raised time and time again, with the railway never to come to fruition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While travelling in the Northern Territory about a month ago, I was interested to talk to the now Chief Minister, Shane Stone. His vision for the Alice Springs&hyphen;Darwin railway, along with his minister, Mr Coulter, and the Premier of South Australia, John Olsen, is to press on and make every effort to ensure that railway is built. While flying down from Darwin to Alice Springs, I had the pleasure to spend a couple of hours with Shane Stone. He was telling me how important it was to the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4410"> territory and said he would do all within his power to make sure that project proceeded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was interested to hear the comments of the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) on infrastructure projects&mdash;about power, downstream processing, et cetera. I am reminded of one of the great private infrastructure projects in my electorate, Olympic Dam. The now $3.5 billion project has proceeded over nearly the last 10 years with very little government help. Projects are proceeding in this country depending on their natural viability, on the competence of those companies and on the ability of those companies to get projects up and running.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the context of what governments can do to encourage infrastructure, I think it is very important to realise that you can tweak things around the edges but, at the end of the day, it is the viability of the project that is the determining factor. We remember Labor's record on Olympic Dam at Roxby Downs, now a world&hyphen;class project. Labor did all it could to prevent that mine going ahead. I think we need just a touch of reality in these matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will make a comment on the approach of the Treasurer to these things. I have said in this place before that, had I been told 14 months ago what would be achieved by this government, I doubt whether I would have believed it. The Treasurer has set this country on a very strong path, in concert with his cabinet colleagues and very much under the leadership of Prime Minister Howard. It is with great pride that I serve on this side of the House as part of that government. I do not say this in any trite way, because there is a deep sense of appreciation of the efforts that have gone in to giving this country the sort of leadership and government which can allow projects like Roxby Downs and many others to proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will not take the House through the detail of the fiscal performance of the government in the 14 short months since its election. I simply remind the people of Australia of the interest rate regime we currently enjoy and of our management of the deficit we inherited. We in this country can look forward to a long 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> period of stability and prosperity as a result of the steps that have been taken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill before us today is just one part of many parts which allow us as Australians to consolidate the many benefits that we enjoy as part of the international scene as citizens of the world. The longer I spend in this place the greater appreciation I have of Australia's place in the world. The opportunities that we are looking forward to based on the last 14 months will be, as they say, `We ain't seen nothing yet.' With those few words, with great pleasure I support the Taxation Laws Amendment (Infrastructure Borrowings) Bill 1997.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset, I want to correct a misconception of the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) and, perhaps to a degree, the former speaker, the member for Grey (Mr Wakelin). A number of very successful infrastructure programs were completed under the previous government. I have in front of me a page and a half of programs, and they include programs that the member for Mitchell would no doubt have experienced. For instance, the M2 motorway either goes through or very near his electorate. I would think that he can hear the cars toot on that motorway now. He has most certainly gone through the Sydney airport domestic terminal. If he has walked through Chinatown, he has most certainly stepped upon the light rail link from Pyrmont to Ultimo. There are, as I say, a page and a half of successful programs including airports, water filtration systems, sewage treatment works, power stations and gas projects, to mention a few.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is just not true to say that the program has not been successful. With respect to the member for Mitchell, his point was quite inconsistent with that advanced by the member for Parramatta (Mr Ross Cameron), who congratulated so many private companies for their involvement in successful infrastructure projects. You cannot have it both ways. You cannot cut a system on the basis of saying that the system has not been successful while, at the same time, having members in your own party congratulating those companies that have been involved in infrastructure projects.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4411">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, this demonstrates the false logic and the false reasoning behind the government virtually cutting out the infrastructure borrowing scheme. I say `virtually cutting out' because their funding is going to facilitate some $2 billion worth of programs whereas, under Labor, there were $22 billion worth of programs in the pipeline&mdash;in other words, a 90 per cent reduction of the actual funding which is available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the member for Parramatta said, infrastructure is essential to society. Indeed, I think he went so far as to refer to the Roman aqueducts and said that successful infrastructure programs have been an ingredient of any successful society. There is no doubt about that. He said that they formed the core assets of the community. There is no doubt about that. He said that those core assets are available to the community as a whole, not just an elite few. There is no doubt about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He said that infrastructure formed a fundamental place in our lives. He said that the infrastructure that we have very much contributes to our quality of life and, indeed, our life expectancy. And there is no doubt about that. Infrastructure is essential. To pare it back by 90 per cent is, at best, with respect, entirely short&hyphen;sighted and, at worst, reckless and incompetent government. Infrastructure provides essential requirements for not only the economy but also society. Obviously, the water treatment plants and the power projects to which I have referred are essential for both industry and also for domestic life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Historically, infrastructure was provided almost exclusively by governments. The member for Mitchell said that this legislation was a welcome change from government monopoly of infrastructure. The member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson) said that the member for Mitchell was almost saying that, until now, there had been some sort of socialist monopoly or control by the former government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, with respect to the member for Mitchell, he has not read what the Labor government's program was about. It was precisely that: it was about bringing in private sector investment into infrastructure. It has done that for a number of reasons: to encour 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> age competition with government monopolies to make the services provided by government more efficient and, obviously, to facilitate the construction of infrastructure projects which otherwise would not have gone ahead or, at least, would not have gone ahead for quite some time given budgetary constraints.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Getting the private sector involved in infrastructure programs was an initiative of the former government. It is not an initiative of this government. This legislation actually pares back by some 90 per cent that private sector opportunity to invest in infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that there is a need to provide incentives for investment in infrastructure projects. Traditionally, private sector investment has been weighted towards small projects. Again, by way of example, I refer to the speech by the member for Mitchell, who referred to the importance of capital investment figures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While capital investment is certainly important, it is not the same thing as infrastructure programs. Capital investment is traditionally capital purchases by a single company for their own activities. That capital purchase is then able to be written off or depreciated against that company's profits. That is not the case with infrastructure projects. Usually, they are projects which involve millions and millions of dollars and the combined skill and knowledge of at least two&mdash;often more than two&mdash;companies, given their various areas of expertise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The difference between a capital purchase and an infrastructure project is that once there are two companies involved in a project they cannot write off the substantial losses incurred&mdash;particularly during those early years of construction of the infrastructure project&mdash;against the profits that the respective companies earn in their normal operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The whole concept of infrastructure projects is one which requires incentives so that companies can have an advantage, during the times of the massive costs that they are incurring, by having some deductibility of those costs and reducing the interest burden that they have to incur in order to successfully undertake the projects. Again, with respect, it is a fundamental flaw in the government's 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4412"> reasoning to equate single one&hyphen;off investments or capital purchases with the requirements that exist for industry, for the private sector, to invest in infrastructure programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been no doubt that industry, corporations&mdash;and you cannot blame them&mdash;are going to invest where they get the best after tax return. With infrastructure, private sector involvement is at a relatively early stage. It could be either very successful or dramatically unsuccessful, with very heavy loss consequences, given the massive amounts spent on the projects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So you can understand why there will be a reluctance to take those dramatic risks if there are simpler, short&hyphen;term investments, such as other trading activities or even purchasing shares on the stock exchange, that companies can undertake. Unless there is an incentive provided by government, that is where the predominance of commercial activity is going to be: in those secondary trading activities and share purchases, not in building what the member for Parramatta said was the fundamental capital of our society and what the member for Wills said was building our armoury, our infrastructure, for the next century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The facts of the matter are that the government really does not understand what it is doing. If it does understand what it is doing, then it is to be condemned because it is really, for base accounting reasons, taking away opportunities  that Australian workers are going to have not only in terms of participating in the construction of the infrastructure projects but also in terms of utilising the resources that we obtain from these infrastructure projects in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has, with respect, also been dishonest. Whether it has been deliberately so is a moot point. The assessment that the infrastructure projects in the pipeline&mdash;which total some $21.6 billion worth of infrastructure funds available&mdash;would result in a revenue loss of $4 billion just does not add up. Moreover, the government has not factored in the important fact that the workers engaged in those projects will pay tax and, on the other side of the equation, the workers engaged in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> those projects clearly will not be receiving unemployment benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we are looking at the consequences of likely massive unemployment in the Newcastle region, the Redbank power project, for instance, would be an excellent example of the employment creating and hence government revenue creating measures which would have followed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the shadow minister for industry and regional development said, under the reasoning or guise of removing taxation rorts, the government has thrown the baby out with the bathwater. That is a cliche, I know, but it is the reality. It is a massive assault, as he said, on industry. It is a massive assault on regional development and on jobs. But it is more than that; it is an assault on the quality of life of all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have in front of me a list of some 147 projects currently awaiting approval. They include a number of essential environmental projects, for instance: the Port Stephens sewage processing facility, the project Z sewage treatment in Sydney, the waste conversion project in Sydney&mdash;which is another sewage treatment process&mdash;and a sewage processing treatment at Mittagong. There are several other projects: the McGraths Hill sewage treatment for the Hawkesbury area, the Picton sewage treatment and the St Marys sewage treatment plant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, I recall an expensive campaign of television advertisements late last year regarding the government's oceans policy. It is mouthing one position via its public&hyphen;funded propaganda but, when it comes to putting money where its propaganda is, it is found wanting. All those treatment projects for sewage going out into our oceans are now at risk because of the government's actions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact of the matter is that this government's record simply does not compare with the former government's record. This government is narrow; it is inward&hyphen;looking; it is literally black and white in terms of balance sheets. The former government contributed $200 million to infrastructure projects and, as well, encouraged private sector investment. The best this government can do is $37.5 million in 1997&hyphen;98 and a measly $112 million 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4413"> over the following three years. It just does not compare. There is also the 90 per cent paring back of funding assistance for private sector involvement in infrastructure projects. As I have said, as of 14 February, there are 147 projects across Australia that are now at risk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the more reprehensible aspects of this legislation is the way in which they have gone about making changes to the infrastructure borrowings regime. If there is one thing that investors require, it is certainty. That is the reason investors choose Australia rather than politically unstable countries in our region. The offhanded and arrogant treatment of genuine, committed, well&hyphen;researched and planned investments by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) is a disgrace, and it will do irreparable damage to our long&hyphen;term reputation as an investment site.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Redbank power project in the Hunter Valley that my friend and colleague the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) will no doubt discuss, together with the Oakey power project in Queensland, are excellent examples of how this government has poorly administered and governed. Those projects had their applications in with the DAA well prior to 10 September 1995 when the Treasurer announced that no further applications would be considered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since that time the DAA have determined their order of priority&mdash;and I am not suggesting any poor judgment on their behalf; they have been processing applications submitted to them prior to 10 September&mdash;and any applications which were certified before 14 February are safe, are up and running. However, the DAA had not considered the Redbank or Oakey proposals and hence, as a result of the Treasurer's announcement of 14 February, those projects are out in the cold, despite the fact that lots of effort and lots of money have gone into the preparation of two very worthwhile projects. Those involved in the preparations are entitled to be more than annoyed&mdash;they are entitled to be outraged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In any commercial relationship, one thing that people expect is integrity. Walking away from the procedures that were in place shows nothing short of a complete absence of integrity. The business community as a whole 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is increasingly starting to realise the lack of depth and the lack of genuineness that this government has when it comes to assisting them to contribute to future opportunities for Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A further issue of real concern is the fact that the Commissioner for Taxation will now be charged with administering the scheme. It is my understanding that, when the scheme was introduced by the former Labor government in 1992, the Commissioner for Taxation had that role. It was found&mdash;with all due respect to appropriate officers in the taxation department&mdash;that they just did not have the expertise to assess infrastructure projects, as it is a very specialised area involving a knowledge of engineering, financing and various issues relating to technology. Indeed, I understand that, in that two&hyphen;year period, only one project&mdash;the M5 project&mdash;was approved by the Commissioner for Taxation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even though only $2 billion will be available for infrastructure projects, the mere fact that it will be poorly administered, I fear, will mean that the benefits for Australia will not flow. The government really is incredibly short&hyphen;sighted and incredibly destructive. It really stands to be condemned for its ignorance and spoiling activities in regard to the future benefits that Australia might have from infrastructure. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to speak on the Taxation Laws Amendment (Infrastructure Borrowings) Bill. The infrastructure borrowings tax concession was brought in by the previous government in the 1992 One Nation statement. It had a very worthy aim&mdash;to allow companies the reduced cost of borrowings to finance construction of infrastructure projects. The concept was that the borrower would forgo deductions for the cost of borrowings such as interest deductions, while the lender would receive the tax benefit and have the interest earned exempt from tax. The intent was that borrowers who did not have a revenue stream to benefit from tax deductibility would pass this benefit on to the lender. It was basically to be a one&hyphen;for&hyphen;one arrangement&mdash;a dollar forgone as tax deduction for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4414"> the borrower given as a dollar gained as a tax deduction for the lender.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Had the scheme retained this original and very genuine one&hyphen;for&hyphen;one benefit, it would have been a scheme with some integrity for the taxpayer. In 1994 when the Development Allowance Authority assumed responsibility for the program, up until 30 June 1996 there were certificates issued for 12 projects. So, for two years, there were virtually 12 projects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, in July and August of 1996 there were 71 applications. So in a two&hyphen;month period there were 71 applications with a total borrowing of $21 billion to $22 billion. The cost to revenue has been estimated at $4 billion over three years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite properly, the Treasurer (Mr Costello) closed the scheme to new applications on 10 September 1996 and asked the Development Allowance Authority to investigate. The outcome of that investigation was that some applications, as they always had been, were genuine; others were extremely tax aggressive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now want to show exactly how aggressive some of those schemes were. The Treasurer has released details of one scheme forwarded to the tax commissioner. The project required funding of $100 million. However, by the time this $100 million had been massaged through interposed companies and packages, the project was worked up to $151 million. The reason for this was that not only was the interest tax deductible but so was the capital gain on the infrastructure borrowing bond. Every time it was on&hyphen;sold, there was a capital gain and this, as well, was tax deductible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once it was worked up to $151 million it was offered to retail investors, but not all retail investors&mdash;and I will get to that in a moment. The way in which it operated was that a lender would offer, say, $500,000. There would be interest and management fees of $85,000. The person approached would take out a loan for $549,000 and contribute $36,000, bringing the total to $585,000. He would then resell the loan to the lender and extinguish the loan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the interest paid on the loan to buy the infrastructure bond is deductible and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> so is the management fee. So for a personal investment of $36,000 there is now $85,000 worth of tax deduction. It should be remembered that this is the scheme about which the member for Barton (Mr McClelland) used the words `assault' and `dishonest'. He is right; it is dishonest, but not in the way he mentioned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will now examine the scheme in more detail. That $85,000 tax deduction at the top marginal rate is worth, as a return, $41,582. It gets even better: they can buy the bond on 28 June for an investment of $36,000, get $85,000 worth of deductions in that financial year, which is worth a return of $41,582. They resell the loan to the lender and extinguish it, and then they can rebuy the same bond in the next financial year and get the same deduction again. If that is recycling, that is a recycling scheme that is of no use to taxpayers, particularly the low income taxpayers in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This scheme was only attractive to those with a minimum taxable income of $135,736&mdash;not your average battling Aussie. And why was it attractive only for somebody with a minimum taxable income of that amount? Simply because it worked at the highest marginal tax rate of 48.5c in the dollar, and that only works for an income of over $50,000. Because you are buying a tax deduction of $85,000, the minimum taxable income had to be $135,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, the financial institution which came up with this scheme was helpful enough to print investment details, starting at a minimum taxable income of $135,000, as I have mentioned, and finishing, certainly on this table&mdash;one imagines it would go a great deal further&mdash;at a minimum taxable income of $466,609. Not exactly a battling Aussie!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The investor's contribution, for somebody on half a million dollars, was $177,059. But what was the total income tax deduction at that figure&mdash;$416,609. That was an assault on the low income earners and the battling taxpayers in this country. But it gets even better, because for somebody earning a minimum taxable income of $135,000, with an $85,000 tax deduction, through this scheme put out by a financial institution, this 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4415"> brings their taxable income down to $50,000. They are eligible for social security. This particular financial institution was helpful enough to print the Department of Social Security guidelines so that those poor people could claim social security.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not an assault by the Treasurer or by this government. That is a blatant abuse of the low income taxpayers in this country to allow somebody on such a high taxable income to make use of the tax base of the federal government in that way. I am very pleased that the Treasurer has moved so quickly to ensure that this scheme is restructured in a way that has integrity and a base for low income earners in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to speak now about the financial institutions in this country. An advertisement in some of the national newspapers in the last few days by one of the major banks accused the Treasurer of bank bashing. I would like to talk about that particular bank and what they have done in one of the small towns in Dawson&mdash;Collinsville. That bank had a bank facility in that town for many years. The town, as many do, unfortunately, came upon hard times. The power station closed and there were jobs lost in the mines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bank closed its facility, but with the full knowledge that the power station was reopening and the mine was going to be taken over by a new contractor. The payroll in that town is now somewhere between $250,000 a week and $350,000 a week, yet that bank closed its banking facility. As well as that, in the town there is a fledgling farming industry with 20 to 30 pickers in the season earning $300 a week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How does this particular bank deal with people in the town wanting to access their wages? Obviously this large payroll is paid into accounts and these people&mdash;not unreasonably&mdash;want to access their wages to settle bills and accounts and spend money with families. The small businesses in that town&mdash;the grocery store and the hotel&mdash;have to have an EFTPOS facility. In one week they have up to $40,000 drawn out on EFTPOS. That particular bank, of course, is charging small businesses for the privilege of doing what they will not do. The EFTPOS costs $40 per 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> month rental, 1.5 per cent on cash transactions and 3.2 per cent on credit cards. In fact, one of the small businesses in the town of Collinsville will be paying $700 a month because the bank that put an ad in the paper about the Treasurer cannot be bothered to put a banking facility in that small town. The small businesses have insurance premiums to pay, security risks, an overdraft and they have inconvenience to their employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I certainly will not say that this particular banking facility was the one responsible for this particular scheme, but I will say that the financial institutions in this country should really consider whether, in fact, they can produce schemes which benefit&mdash;on a ratio of one to seven in some cases&mdash;people with a minimum taxable income of $135,000 and yet charge small businesses in small country towns for doing what they refuse to do any more, which is to provide banking facilities in small communities. One of the women in the community of Collinsville, who is on a pension, has to take a four&hyphen;hour trip to be able to get a new bank book every time she needs one. She can only access $100 through the EFTPOS facility at the grocery shop. Yet these banks are accusing the Treasurer of bank bashing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The comments made by those on the other side about the government being dishonest in removing this scheme are simply invalid. The taxpayer was not getting value through this existing infrastructure borrowing scheme. If it had been, as I said, on a one to one ratio&mdash;a dollar forgone by the borrower as a dollar of benefit to the lender&mdash;then fine. But not on a one to seven ratio. All that is doing is benefiting high marginal taxpayers, in terms of their ability to save, to the cost of people on low incomes. Some other taxpayer would have had to bear the cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very pleased that the Treasurer has moved to eliminate abuse and misuse of taxpayers' funds in this manner. However, the Treasurer has put in a scheme to take the place of this particular one. Announced in the budget was the infrastructure borrowings tax rebate, a program which will make up to $75 million per annum, including running costs, available to those who wish to invest in the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4416"> private sector for projects such as roads, rail and related facilities. This will give successful applicants a tax rebate for interest which has been incurred and certainly will avoid the pitfalls of the original scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like now very briefly to talk about other incentives in the previous budget for regional areas. I note that in the budget just brought down by the Treasurer there has been a regional focus with over $4 billion in future spending initiatives. Those include, of course, the infrastructure borrowings tax rebate I have just mentioned and $800 million for 18,700 kilometres of national highways and roads of national importance in 1996&hyphen;97. Ninety per cent of that is to be spent on rural roads, creating over 19,000 jobs. There are $11 million for a national survey of bridge requirements to ascertain whether the bridges on the national highway are able to take increased loadings. There are $250 million for a regional telecommunications infrastructure fund; $48 million for a regional forest agreement; $1.2 million for a regional minerals program looking at the development of new mines and new mineral processing facilities; and $75 million over four years for the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, a very welcome initiative in northern Queensland where we have had infestations of the papaya fruit fly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last budget there were also very important employment initiatives: $21 million for work for the dole schemes for 10,000 young people in the highest areas of youth unemployment. Of the total of 70 of those schemes, 50 will be in regional areas. There are $20 million to assist through the depressed regions program. It will enable those areas where there have been major retrenchments or difficulties to retrain and to diversify their industry base. There are $5.2 million in 1997 for a national tourism development program and $14.72 million over seven years for a cooperative research centre for sustainable tourism to look at economic and ecologically sustainable tourist attractions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For families living in regional areas, particularly in the area of child care, there were an additional 2&half; thousand places for family day care. For Austudy, particularly for young 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> people in a family where there were two students away from home in tertiary study, there is an opportunity to access an additional $925 per year to assist with the costs of study. This is a very worthwhile recognition of the cost for children in regional areas who not only have to travel but also have to pay for accommodation in tertiary education centres far from home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was very pleased at many of the initiatives in the budget. We are looking at additional funds for schooling: four per cent more for schooling in 1997&hyphen;98, going from $3.6 billion in funding to $3.75 billion. In fact it is very pleasing to see all of the new schools that are being opened. We have recently had one open in the seat of Dawson; a very welcome addition to the schooling capacity in my electorate. There are $160 million for literacy programs, $156 million for speech learning needs and $54 million for languages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the best initiatives in the budget are those related to indigenous programs&mdash;$124 million over four years for an indigenous business incentive program to look at Aboriginal communities in rural and remote areas attaining economic independence. There has been a great deal of success at Badu Island with exports of pearls and lobsters. The Cootha Aboriginal Development Corporation at Cloncurry now has a contract worth some millions of dollars with MIM to transport gold and copper concentrate. Of course, the biggest art export from Australia is Aboriginal art. That is a very worthwhile incentive program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would now like to turn to some of the projects that would benefit from an infrastructure borrowings scheme such as that brought in by the Treasurer. I would like to speak about one of the dams in our area, Urannah, which has had an economic analysis undertaken by Dr Richard Brown and Jackie Robinson of the University of Central Queensland&mdash;two very well respected advisers to the Queensland Treasury.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They have looked at this scheme, using four economic indicators. The return per dollar invested is the total return in dollars to the state government that would occur over the life of the project. A 30&hyphen;year study period is taken for a dam or water storage facility, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4417"> although such projects have much longer lives than that. This particular dam would return $40.40 for every dollar invested, at a six per cent discount rate, which is a substantial return for the state government. This water storage facility has a return in jobs created of 6,069 jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we are looking at job creation and regional development it is very important to look at programs which are going to open up opportunities for industry in regional areas. There are 22 mines in the Bowen Basin which are at present unable to open because of lack of water. If we had a water storage facility such as the Urannah dam or other water schemes proposed, there would be a tremendous growth in jobs in that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very pleased to see that the Queensland government in its recent budget has also addressed the need for regional infrastructure funding through a water infrastructure task force and funds that are going to be allocated over the next few years for Priority One water storage projects. I commend to the House the Taxation Laws Amendment (Infrastructure Borrowings) Bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to compliment the honourable member for Dawson (Mrs De&hyphen;Anne Kelly), who managed to use over half her speaking time unchallenged to talk about things which have nothing at all to do with the legislation before the House. But I do understand that as a government backbencher it is hard to get a speaking spot on the budget bills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I heard the honourable member refer to a mild leak of the Commissioner of Taxation published just recently about these dreadful aggressive tax planners. I would ask her, when she gets a moment, to have a look at some of the aggressive tax collection processes adopted by the Commissioner of Taxation&mdash;that is, if she is not frightened of a tax audit for her audacity, should she find the need to talk about it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When distributing risk and rewards to the private sector, governments should ensure that returns accruing to the private investors are commensurate with the risks they face, no more and no less.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So said the Allen Consulting Group in its submission to the government on a replace 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment program for the former government's infrastructure borrowings scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report was similar in content to many others submitted to the government. Those who have benefited from the infrastructure borrowings program in the past are typically not seeking a handout. They are not interested in business welfare. Private investors wanted to see a new program introduced that demonstrated a balance between the protection of government revenue and the encouragement of business spending on infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former infrastructure borrowings program fulfilled the latter criterion but was subject to abuse under certain tax minimisation schemes. Conversely, it is doubtful whether the new infrastructure borrowings scheme as announced by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in the 1997&hyphen;98 budget will enhance private infrastructure expenditure because of the limited eligibility criteria. In addition to stimulating business investment, a report released in 1996 by Invest Australia found that the original program had brought about substantial benefits to the Australian community. These benefits included lower user charges because of both the reduced cost of infrastructure and an increase in both construction activity and employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report also noted that the call on government budgets lessened as private infrastructure expenditure increased and that the sustainable rate of growth of the economy as a whole increased. However, as the Allen Consulting Group recognised, the overall trend in the growth rate of capital stock has continued to fall over the past 30 years. Their submission to the government states that investment in Australia accounted for around 26 per cent of gross domestic product in the 1960s but that by 1995&hyphen;96 this rate had dropped to approximately 21 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Allen group suggested that this was largely because of a drop in public sector investment in infrastructure, which has halved to four per cent over the past three decades. This position was echoed by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, which recently found that Australia's capital productivity has fallen below the OECD mean by as much as 10 per cent. At the same time, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4418"> however, private sector investment in infrastructure has been on the incline, and its share now accounts for 20 per cent of total infrastructure investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the fact that the lead time between construction and profitable operation is typically a lengthy one, the private sector has continued to channel resources into the development of infrastructure. Furthermore, despite substantial losses that have to be borne by stand-alone companies during this lead time without them being able to claim a tax deduction, there has not been a drop, nor even a plateau, in private sector infrastructure investment. This was at least in part because of the concept of the former government's infrastructure borrowings scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is widely accepted by economists that a nation's rate of investment impacts significantly on how quickly an economy can grow. The Allen group summed this up very succinctly by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Without much doubt, the decline (in infrastructure investment) has led to a decline in Australia's sustainable rate of economic growth.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The fact that Australia has seen a consistent decline in public funded infrastructure during the past 30 years should be of real concern to all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a 1993 report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Land transport infrastructure: maximising the contribution to economic growth</EMPHASIS>, the importance of land transport infrastructure was emphasised. The report found:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Road investments . . . have a permanent, positive effect on real gross domestic product, investment, consumption and exports.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Also, if the balancing of the books continues to be this government's priority in the short term&mdash;and there is some argument in favour of that&mdash;then the onus for infrastructure expenditure will fall squarely on the shoulders of private investors. The March 1997 submission to the government on infrastructure borrowings from the Australian Constructors Association read in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Provided the returns to the private sector are commensurate with the risks they take, this is all sound policy.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It goes on:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, for this new regime to operate effectively, the taxation system must not contain impediments to private investment, or distort the incentives to undertake some types of investment rather than others.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Clive Meller, a tax director at Coopers and Lybrand, recently observed that the removal of the previous infrastructure borrowings program will make it harder and more expensive for indigenous Australian companies to compete with their overseas rivals. Mr Meller noted that this is because construction of high capital value projects often involves a joint venture. Under Australian law, there is the requirement for 100 per cent ownership as a prerequisite to the transfer of any losses to the original companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In contrast, many foreign companies benefit from tax laws which allow the joint venture losses on depreciation or borrowings to be `absorbed by the contributing companies in proportion to their equity interest', and that seems eminently fair. Mr Meller suggests that this contrast in tax law means that investment in infrastructure in Australia would be limited to those few companies with `extremely deep pockets as well as lots of patience'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Council for Infrastructure Development or AUSCID supported this argument and said that the previous infrastructure bonds scheme offset some of these disincentives in the tax system. It was for this reason that AUSCID recommended a replacement program based on a voucher system, on the grounds that it would `redress these disincentives in the most accurate and targeted manner'. While it is true that infrastructure borrowings have been used by some high income earners to minimise their tax obligations, it is equally true that the original scheme was largely responsible for stimulating private sector infrastructure expenditure in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The Allen report identified two arguments for the continued special treatment of investments in infrastructure. The first substantiates a point made earlier, and that is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a disincentive for the private sector to invest in infrastructure because of the long lead times and therefore the long periods that private investors must wait until deductible expenses may be claimed against income flows. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4419">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The second argument is that the report found that large investments tend only to be made by consortia of companies which cannot claim tax expenses against income from other sources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the whole, industry has been less concerned about the axing of the infrastructure borrowings program than with ensuring that an effective, highly targeted replacement program is introduced. Both the Allen Consulting Group and AUSCID were very specific on this point in their submissions to the Treasurer earlier this year. AUSCID recommended as a matter of priority that the coalition `urgently enacts measures to introduce an effective incentive to encourage genuine private sector investment in public infrastructure'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Treasurer was right to support the continuation of the infrastructure borrowings program in his earlier budget. However, the nature of the replacement scheme will mean that only land transport projects will be eligible for exemption in future. Some analysts have argued that this will all but close off the scheme, because most tollways and other projects which would have qualified under the new scheme had already been certified under the old program. AUSCID was also adamant that the government should consult with industry groups to determine the most effective replacement scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Several commentators have criticised the lack of consultation between the government and industry groups prior to the Treasurer's announcement on 14 February 1997 which foreshadowed the demise of infrastructure borrowings. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> quoted one expert as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This decision (to axe the infrastructure borrowings scheme) was made without any consultation with industry . . . as well as throwing the investment community here into disarray, it sends a very confused signal to investors offshore, who provide vital capital to strengthen and maintain its stock of infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is yet another instance of the coalition failing to convert the rhetoric of opposition into action in government. The globalisation of finance is one factor that has facilitated the increase in private sector infrastructure investment during recent decades. Foreign invest 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment is crucial to the maintenance of infrastructure in Australia because of the limited pool of domestic Australian funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former Labor government's much touted pooled developments fund&mdash;the PDF initiative&mdash;proved to be an unqualified failure. It failed because it did not compensate investors for the additional risk and lack of liquidity associated with investing in the small business sector. The original infrastructure borrowings scheme, while more successful than the PDFs, was neither capped nor appropriately targeted and was abused by a handful of high marginal taxpayers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> It was essential that the coalition should introduce an effective replacement program for infrastructure bonds in a timely fashion to prevent the withdrawal of important foreign capital from domestic infrastructure projects. This was noted in the editorial of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 26 September 1996. The editor wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To pretend that Australia can establish itself as an important finance centre without bidding for business is both naive and complacent. By failing to confront this reality Australia has let an important opportunity slip past largely by default.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The combination of limited domestic funds and the disincentives that are inherent in our tax system left no room for doubt that, without a worthy replacement for the IB scheme, Australia would have been less competitive in the global marketplace as a result of the Treasurer's announcement on 14 February.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The submission from the Australian Constructors Association concluded that it was not the infrastructure bonds per se that promoted business investment in infrastructure, but rather:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a recognition by government that there was a significant problem in the tax system which, left unaltered, would have severely hampered the development of privately provided infrastructure in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They argued convincingly for the need to have an incentive measure that is stable, certain and which facilitates the mobilisation of investment funds through capital markets. The Treasurer has indicated that the marked increase in the number of applications for infrastructure borrowings in the weeks preced 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4420"> ing the last budget was proof of abuse of the former scheme. This is exactly the same argument pursued by the government before it savaged the 150 per cent R&amp;D concession last August.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> What the Treasurer failed to recognise then, and what he fails to acknowledge now, is that industry responded in this manner because of the lack of certainty about the future of both the R&amp;D and infrastructure borrowings schemes. AUSCID argued that the replacement scheme:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . must have advance certainty and qualification, (because) it is at the investment decision stage that certainty of the benefits is most critical and most effective.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">A lack of certainty and longevity has also plagued the R&amp;D incentive scheme since its inception.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said during the debate on Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1996 that the challenge before the government today is how to maximise interest amongst the investment community and so increase their long-term commitment to funding research and development in Australia. This is equally true of the efforts the government must make to entice business investment in infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The narrow selection criteria for the new infrastructure borrowings scheme is unlikely to generate anything like the levels of private infrastructure investment necessary to cement our place in an increasingly competitive marketplace. Industry had presented the coalition with several alternatives to the late infrastructure borrowings plans prior to the 1997-98 budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, industry favoured the introduction of a voucher system to enhance business infrastructure investment. It favoured the voucher system because it would have allowed the government to control the cost of the program while supporting a large amount of infrastructure investment. The Allen Consulting Group estimated that $5.56 billion in investment would be sustained by vouchers totalling only $200 million each year&mdash;a substantial investment boost in anyone's book.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Supporters of the voucher proposition also state that the time has come for the coalition to embrace some of the more important 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> micro-economic reform proposals that will continue to ensure an increase in the level of business investment in this country. They argue that the government should not opt to promote investment through selective conferral of benefits on particular projects of particular firms. Benefits should be general in nature so that all potential investment projects in Australia stand to gain. In this way, there are no distortionary effects on economic activity, and everyone is treated fairly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, as indicated earlier, the new infrastructure borrowings program is to be restricted to supporting only land infrastructure projects. So while organisations, including the Australian Constructors Association, are content with the concept of a tax rebate being at the centre of the new IB program, they are concerned that many legitimate and worthwhile projects will be discarded because of the new guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the government certainly lacks is a long-term plan to manage infrastructure investment in Australia. Many industry professionals have called on the coalition to establish a national infrastructure advisory council to coordinate the planning of future infrastructure, as well as collect and maintain data. In an interview with the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 27 February 1997, Ms Lynne Reeder, a senior policy analyst at the Institute of Engineers, noted that one of the consequences of the decline in public funded infrastructure and the simultaneous rise in business investment has been a loss of recorded technical data.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She said that a large body of maintenance information, statistics, operating data and technical expertise was automatically built up and housed in public departments before the decline in government funded infrastructure. She suggested that such formerly comprehensive records are no longer being maintained or are not able to be accessed by public bodies. Ms Reeder believes that this is having a significant negative impact on the maintenance of existing infrastructure, as well as preventing effective long-term planning and decision making. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to speak in relation to this Taxation 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4421"> Laws Amendment (Infrastructure Borrowings) Bill 1997, I follow the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), and as usual in this place, he has given a considered speech. The most important part of that speech was the fact that he outlined that this coalition government has no long-term plan in relation to infrastructure borrowings and infrastructure expenditure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might contrast that understanding of infrastructure borrowings and its needs with a speech earlier today in this place by the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman). The honourable member argued that the two key things the coalition government needed to do were to reduce debt and to increase jobs. In arguing that general proposition he said that capital expenditure had gone down under Labor and he outlined an argument, one that had been put previously by the Treasurer (Mr Costello), that in regard to the infrastructure borrowings operating under Labor those programs had been rorts. Because they had been rorts, they had to be done away with and replaced with this amendment bill. He indicated that with $37.5 million of tax rebates this year and $75 million next year it was expected that $2 billion worth of infrastructure spending would be generated. Two billion dollars is a lot of infrastructure spending.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill replaces Labor's previous measures. There were $21 billion worth of projects on offer under those borrowing programs. The Treasurer, and with him the member for Mitchell, have argued that those programs were primarily rorts. They were not, and they would have provided more than 10 times the amount of infrastructure spending that is on offer from this myopic coalition government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Their core problem in relation to infrastructure spending is that they do not understand, firstly, what infrastructure spending is; secondly, its central importance in the economy as a whole; and, thirdly, the fact that the Commonwealth government of Australia has responsibilities and duties and a central place in terms of pushing forward the infrastructure needs of this nation. So scrap the Labor program that had been in place to provide increased investment expenditure from the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> private sector in infrastructure programs; completely misrepresent and distort what had been done under great Labor programs in the past such as One Nation, Working Nation and Building Better Cities; and provide a political response allied to much diminished government involvement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at what the coalition is proposing in this bill, it is proposing minor assistance to infrastructure spending in this nation, less than one&hyphen;tenth of what was on offer under Labor, and that one&hyphen;tenth in relation to this borrowings bill was apart from the great programs that had been cemented into place and had actual definable, quantifiable, real outcomes in terms of boosting jobs, both in the short and medium term, and in providing for a better infrastructure for this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia has a number of natural competitive advantages. We have a reliable electricity system, clean water, abundant raw materials and an educated work force. Allied to that, we have a good road and rail network and good seaports. But one thing that was clear to the Labor government was that these needed to be upgraded. If you did not put the money into re&hyphen;investing in your infrastructure, if you let those degrade, if you did not look at new and better ways to join the ports, the roads and the rails, then you would not be able to get your product to market efficiently either within Australia or overseas. The One Nation program was a core and fundamental attempt to bring, finally, this disparate nation of six separate states with outmoded infrastructure, fragmented and disconnected, together into one truly connected nation where through rail and road transport we could get product from one side of Australia to the other quickly and efficiently.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Infrastructure and spending on infrastructure is in fact the binding agent that can really bring Australia together as one entity, one real nation. It is the backbone, sinews and muscles of that national body. That clearly is not understood by the member for Mitchell and this current Treasurer or, if they do understand it, they regard it as not very significant or not important: the problem of reducing debt is much greater than the problem of building infrastructure.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4422">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we look at the components of infrastructure and the key role that it plays in any economy, we can argue that it has four central elements. The first of those is that infrastructure is an element of economic growth. Secondly, it plays an important role in achieving social equity in a country. Thirdly, it is important for governing and managing the environment and, fourthly, it is important in terms of the country's competitive position in relation to the rest of the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part of the new growth theory states that when a country's level of investment drops, particularly in infrastructure, then so too does its economic growth. Perhaps this is intuitively understood: to achieve any growth you must have an infrastructure in place. There is no use building the best planes in the world unless you have airports to fly them from. However, this fundamental linkage between investment and job creation and growth does not seem to be well understood by this coalition government. I do not think they also understand that one of the key critical elements in infrastructure planning and development is the whole place of location and building nodes around which infrastructure can develop an economic output.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nodes of industry appear or areas of competitive advantage appear, and you can either choose to develop those or you can let them waste away. You can choose to leave it to the free market. You can choose to say that private investors and private companies will know where they want to invest, where they want to build infrastructure and all will be well. Alternatively, you can take the position that Labor took during its time in government. It understood that the federal government of Australia does have a central place in infrastructure spending. That is a place of leadership and it is a place where the federal government should be actively involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This coalition government, however, I think fails to understand that and it fails to understand it in part because its guiding ideology, expressed in this document&mdash;the National Commission of Audit report&mdash;sees very little place for infrastructure spending and sees very little place for the Commonwealth government except in a benchmarking and prioritis 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ing role. Indeed, at page 200 of that report they state this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth's role in relation to national infrastructure (beyond its GBEs) includes: direct investments or expenditures such as defence and public broadcasting.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">On that first point, they actually recommend direct expenditures for defence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been a member of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for almost 11 months. In the last year of the Labor government&mdash;the year prior to my coming into this parliament&mdash;there were 46 references to the public works committee. There have been very few references in the last 11 months. Those references have primarily been for building defence infrastructure and renovating our defence capability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Almost all the trips taken by members of the Public Works Committee to new defence facilities in Western Australia, Darwin and Queensland have been directed towards building infrastructure, because the defence of this Commonwealth needs and requires refreshment and reinvigoration of basic defence foundations. The rest of the public works that the committee used to investigate have disappeared into the ether.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those public works have disappeared into the ether because the coalition government does not believe in direct service provision by the Commonwealth government. It does not believe that government should be directly involved in building the infrastructure of Commonwealth government departments. It does not believe in that because, essentially, it wants to get out of the game, except for infrastructure building in the defence area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The National Commission of Audit also says that there should be incentives for improvements in efficiency of state infrastructure; development in conjunction with the states of a regulatory framework for improving access to any infrastructure; grants to the states for education, health and roads; and, particularly relevant to the bill before us today, taxation incentives such as infrastructure bonds to encourage private sector financing for a number of areas of infrastructure. However, beyond that it recommends virtually 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4423"> no role for the Commonwealth government of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The philosophy underlying this National Commission of Audit and the philosophy underpinning and underlying the first two budgets of this coalition government is that the role of the Commonwealth government of Australia as a central player in infrastructure and as a central player in the development of this country should eventually disappear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition government does not understand that areas of this country become the focus for competition and take advantage of particular infrastructure capabilities and, further, that those nodes compete in a global marketplace. The world is organised around key nodes of infrastructure and these nodes are interconnected. Air travel and shipping are two examples of this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that we are integrated into a global economy. We need to think strategically so that we are not driven into economic subservience because we do not make the infrastructure commitments that we should. One of the most expensive key areas in terms of developing ourselves economically is the willingness to put money into infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to make a comparison with what has happened in other places in the world. The Japanese, finally&mdash;and certainly not before time&mdash;have recognised that they need massive infrastructure spending in Japan. They cannot continue to buy up properties overseas and build businesses overseas, when the dramatically depleted infrastructure of Japan needs money spent on it. In fact, last year they spent $270 billion on it: a national government spending national moneys on the infrastructure of its country. A comparison can also be made with the French who, lacking any real idea of the importance of putting their money into infrastructure, spent more on dog food than on the total budget of the city of Paris.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The National Commission of Audit said that there should be a great deal of microeconomic reform in a series of areas, but that the Commonwealth government had very little role to play in that. What it fundamentally misunderstands is that this federal government does have a role to play in national infrastruc 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ture. That role is directly connected to creating jobs and enhancing the economic growth of this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous Labor government fully understood that it was incumbent upon them to build one nation and to build better cities&mdash;to build a nation whose muscles, sinews, backbone and framework were tied together through the Commonwealth government of Australia spending money on good projects. I might make reference to two key programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first of those programs is the building better cities program, introduced by the former Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Brian Howe. I believe that in this parliament there has been no better program of great infrastructure work done where cooperation between local government bodies, the states and the Commonwealth has been better expressed than under the aegis of the better cities program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This coalition government, both before and since coming to power, pilloried the building better cities program. They therefore pilloried the work that had been done in South Australia with building better cities funds. They therefore pilloried the Advanced Technology Park at Eveleigh in Sydney&mdash;a technology park where 5,000 to 6,000 jobs will be gained over time; a technology park which will lead Australia to be at the forefront of almost every other country in the world; and a technology park which is the best located in the world. It would not, and could not, have existed and would not have been in the position, as it is now, to expand its activities, if the state government had not provided the land, and if the money to build the facility had not been provided under the building better cities program. In fact, that program at large has generated 60,000 jobs and raised an additional $3.7 billion worth of investment from the private sector and other levels of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That program had direct measurable effects. Underpinning it was the notion that the federal government could spend money on infrastructure and that, if it did not do so, no-one else would. This has been the case with a variety of projects which have been in the national interest but which the private sector 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4424"> would not take up because it had no interest in them. But in that program the benefits to the wider economy were significant: between $1.5 million and $4 million was gained in growth from every $1 million spent under the better cities program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a range of programs under the building better cities program that started the rebuilding of the infrastructure of this nation. For the first time in the history of this country under the regional development programs&mdash;so deliberately, utterly and completely axed by this government&mdash;disparate regions of Australia were directly connected to this national capital; they saw that they could cooperate, as well as compete, with other regions and saw that the federal government of Australia had a direct and continuing interest in their development. Having been able to see that under Labor, they can now also see, with the destruction of the regional development program, that this coalition government cares nought for the people of Australia and Australian regions in terms of the fundamental rebuilding of the infrastructure of this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would point out that, in terms of the building better cities program, the annual report of the Department of Transport and Regional Development&mdash;still misnamed, given the fact that the government have given up the game of regional development&mdash;said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Better Cities Program operated through 26 `area strategies' in cooperation with State and Territory Governments. The cooperative approach allowed a number of urban management problems to be addressed and resolved more effectively and efficiently than would otherwise have been the case. The Better Cities approach aroused considerable international interest in the OECD and similar forums.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It did not arouse the interest of this coalition government because they canned it. They saw it, and had no interest in it. They typified it and misrepresented it as simply a `poor Labor program'. But it had entirely observable and beneficial effects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Probably no one program introduced by the former Labor government has been more pilloried than the One Nation program. This government does not have the insight, the sense or the courtesy to recognise the fact that this program really did address the infrastruc 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ture needs of this country. In the very first line of the speech made in relation to infrastructure, the former Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A fundamental determinant of Australia's international competitiveness is an efficient infrastructure base.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That efficient infrastructure base found its firm expression in the attempt to build a rail link from one side of this country to the other, so that we could take our people and produce efficiently from one side to the other.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This bill, the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill 1996, returns for a final time to this House. I thought it was very timely that the first serious piece of press analysis of the effect of the heritage trust appeared today in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> , with the author of that commentary piece describing the legislation as a `pea and thimble trick'. That is a very accurate description of the nature of the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In discussing this matter when it a came back from the Senate the other evening, I made the point that, in the first two years of the life of the trust alone, the trust falls some $83 million short of the funding promised by the coalition in its Meeting our Commitments documents. It really is a betrayal of the mandate that was sought from the Australian people. When one considers the linked pledges of the last election: to sell Telstra and establish this fund, and to ensure that the revenues that were provided to the trust were on top of&mdash;additional to&mdash;the forward estimates of the previous Labor government, and then takes careful stock of what exactly has occurred since those pledges were made, what we find is a betrayal, a complete betrayal, of that electoral mandate.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not necessary today to rehash all the points I made in debate the other evening. But I do think it is important to look at the credentials of this government as they unravel piece by piece in relation to the environment. It would be remiss of me today if I did not mention a parallel decision that was made in the Senate on the issue of disallowance of regulations which have been established for over 20 years to give the Commonwealth power to protect the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those were the customs prohibited exports regulations, and they have been in existence to do two things: firstly, to ensure that Australia gets adequate prices for its resources; but, secondly, to ensure that there is a framework which enables the Commonwealth to activate its powers where Australia's vital environment interests are at stake. The removal of those Commonwealth export powers has enormous consequences for the management of Australia's environment&mdash;and that is a responsibility that the Australian government has now seen fit to abolish.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth's control over the export of mineral sand products enabled a previous Liberal coalition government to ban sandmining developments on Fraser Island in Queensland. Under the framework that this government has now adopted, a future coalition Liberal government faced with the same issue, with the same kind of environmental consequences, would be powerless to intervene to protect the environment from such destruction. I think it is as well to reflect on that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister now charged with the responsibility for administering these areas of policy is the Minister for Resources and Energy, Senator Parer. In the debate when Labor was able to forestall the removal of such regulations on the last occasion, he said, in relation to Fraser Island, that the use of export control powers by the previous Fraser Liberal government to protect that important area&mdash;which has now been protected as a world heritage property&mdash;was `an abuse of power'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From a government whose ministers say that the protection of Fraser Island was an abuse of power, one gets the sense of the real priority that this government places on protec 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4429"> tion of the environment. It also gives some framework to reflect on the way in which the sting has been put in, the con has been perpetrated on the Australian public, with the establishment of a trust which was intended to be supplemental to forward estimates but which has been massively underfunded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The forward estimates that the previous government had put in place provided a framework for significant environmental protection. But what we have seen are clawbacks.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will take only a few minutes of the House's time to make a few comments on this, as I missed the opportunity to do so the other night. I believe that this particular trust, and the legislation that goes with it, is the greatest piece of political environmental trickery that has ever been imposed on an Australian electorate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said last year in debate on this bill when it was first in this House that $1.1 billion, as it now is, is basically 1.1 billion trees. We are already out there supposedly planting one billion trees, and that program has been chopped short. And barely on the horizon can we see the impact that that planting has made in reversing the huge environmental problems we have. I said then that this trust will go no way towards making any real impact on the 2001 Murray-Darling program; it is really a 2101 project that we should be looking at. We should have made provision for funding for the environmental program of this country that took account of that very fact. And there was always the way it has gone now, of course, of quarantining part of the profits and part of the returns from Telstra, and preserving 23,000 jobs whilst so doing, and funding the environment on an ongoing basis through those means.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to again incorporate into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> some comments I made back in December on this bill. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Chain Reaction</EMPHASIS> magazine of the Scitech organisation stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Howard Government's proposed Natural Heritage Trust is a `blatant and cynical political 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> fraud', a senior Government adviser has admitted to Scitech.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">He said the policy&mdash;the Coalition's claimed answer to rectifying Australia's enormous environmental problems&mdash;was `invented overnight' as a means of attempting to soften potential public reaction against the planned sale of one-third of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The plan had been essentially devised&mdash;as a `purely political exercise'&mdash;by the Federal Director of the Liberal Party, Mr Andrew Robb, and had then been `imposed' on the former shadow Minister . . . Senator Rod Kemp, and subsequently, on . . . Senator Robert Hill . . . </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The adviser said Coalition MPs openly joked behind closed doors about the policy and admitted to the fact that it could not possibly&mdash;in its current form or size&mdash;make any serious impact on the nation's massive problems of land degradation, ailing rivers, and loss of biodiversity.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As an interjection from one member of the House at the time said: that says it all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are giving with one hand and taking with the other, as was mentioned in relation to this. I notice the financial estimated outlays from the budget this year include savings of $5 million from the landcare program to contribute to the government's fiscal target. This will be achieved by reduced capital works, particularly on infrastructure and sewage treatment projects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Only this week I received a letter from a council in my area saying, `Where is this support that was once available for sewerage projects in country towns, where the federal government provided a third of the capital funding?' Where is it? A couple of villages in my electorate have serious sewerage problems. They happen to be in the catchment of the Lachlan and the Macquarie system. Are we really serious about the Murray-Darling Basin clean up when we set aside what I believe is a very paltry fund to look at our environmental programs?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I oppose this method of funding the environment. I will certainly give it every support out there because it has been passed, but I fear&mdash;in fact, I am sure&mdash;we will be no better off. How do we fund it meaningfully? Do we sell off more at the end of this program? What then? We have lost 20,000 jobs in a publicly owned institution that was providing us with cutting-edge technology, jobs and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4430"> expertise. That asset has gone. Do we sell more of our silverware down the track to cope with our environmental problem?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The environmental movement is just catching up with the ramifications of this piece of legislation. It is a pity it did not scream earlier during the election campaign, because it is a fraud. The public out there did not want to get rid of Telstra, particularly in the bush. Why did you not have a referendum out there to see? They did not and they still do not want to get rid of it. They have grave doubts about it. They do not believe that this trust will go any way towards scratching the surface, let alone beginning to solve our environmental problems.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted with the remarks by the member for Calare (Mr Andren). He accurately reflects the reality of the nature of this trust. Certainly, it is true that those environmentalists who took a walk in the wilderness with the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) before this trust was put in place lent their credibility to that process&mdash;wrongly&mdash;but I suspect none of them would have realised the magnitude of the deception that was about to be played on them. They were wrong to give credibility to what would have been an inadequate process in the first place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Since that process, this government has been falling significantly short of its pre&hyphen;election commitments: acting deceitfully in the Senate; proposing to extend the life of the trust from five to six years without funding; and withdrawing effectively $42 million per annum from the effective value of the trust. All those elements, together with the reduction of programs in primary industry and a whole range of training and related programs, mean that effectively the resources coming collectively towards the protection of the environment and sustainable development have been reduced rather than enhanced as a result of this government's actions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend to all members of this House the article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> by Ken Davidson this morning. It brings together the criticisms that are emerging which we have been making in opposition, which the member for Calare has been making and which the environment 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> movement now, through the board of the ACF, has endorsed. I suspect that anybody who had any residual doubts about the credibility of this government would have had them confirmed now, and with these decisions that would render powerless a future coalition government to protect an area like Fraser Island.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This coalition risks taking environmental protection back to the 1960s. Rules that have been put in place for over 20 years and that have been the trigger for the Commonwealth for making environmental assessments for mining activities have been torn up. What faith can you have in a government whose minister has been consistently overridden on every occasion when he has had any contest with any of his ministerial colleagues? The government rejected the suggestion that Senator Hill, as the Minister for the Environment, be made chair of the board that was supervising this trust. There has not been one time since he has been the Minister for the Environment where he has actually had a victory for the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He is continually being rolled. Senator Parer rolled him on the issue of mining exploration in forest reserves. Mr Anderson, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, rolled him on the quantity of land to be allocated to dedicated forest reserves in the East Gippsland regional forest agreement. The Prime Minister has a tendency to pre-empt the minister's decision, whether it be on the Port Hinchinbrook development or the decision to relocate the Coode Island chemical storage facility to the Point Lillias Ramsar listed wetlands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a record of environmental ineptitude: a weak minister and a process that has fundamentally betrayed the election mandate that this government claimed. It is a deceitful government which showed its deceit most markedly when it went into the Senate on the day the Treasurer (Mr Costello) was about to stand up and announce the budget would be extending the life of the trust with no additional funding&mdash;so the effective value of the trust was going to be reduced&mdash;and put forward amendments in the Senate without disclosing their nature; it put them forward as 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4431"> technical amendments going to the interest rate that the fund would earn. It deceitfully sought to get those amendments through the parliament without the parliament's attention being drawn to their effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a government whose actions are clouded with deceit and betrayal, whose environmental credibility has gone down point by point by point, which is leading us back to a situation where protection of the environment has the same priority that it received in the 1960s when we did not have available the necessary mechanisms to protect the environment, and whose credibility is now standing at point zero with the Australian community.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He has not stitched us up, but you have sought to seriously misrepresent the situation as you know it to be. There are a couple of other points that I would seek to make. One is in relation to the claims of the member for Calare (Mr Andren) about the sale of Telstra and the attitude towards it in rural Australia. I remind him that the National Farmers Federation made it quite plain that they believed that the policy we adopted in relation to Telstra amounted to very sound economic policy as well as sound environmental policy, as well they might.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a couple of other points worth making. If you look at one program, the national landcare program, whilst it was to phase down very considerably in terms of the forward estimates that were made available by the previous government, there was a very 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> substantial drop off. There is a record amount of funding for that this year&mdash;$87-odd million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mention one other point in relation to sewerage works in the Murray-Darling Basin&mdash;just to pull apart one argument and to illustrate that what we have had put before us is a pack of cards. Not only has a great deal of sewerage works in the Murray-Darling Basin been undertaken under the national landcare program but programming and funding for such works are still available under the Natural Heritage Trust.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude my remarks by pointing out that the people opposite are very welcome to go out and run these lines through the recipients of the grants which will help them really involve themselves in community action, in environmental works, in efforts related to sustainable production and sustainable use of our agricultural lands. They will be laughed out of court for the bitterness and the negativity of their approach when compared with the approaches that they have put forward and money that they intended to spend as reflected in the outlays and as reflected in their campaign promises, which, incidentally, were never funded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No-one has ever told us where the money was going to come from. That really reflects very poorly upon an opposition not prepared to take advantage of something that plainly is very much in the interests of the Australian environment and sustainable agriculture.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was compelled to respond to the self-advertised endorsement of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) by the National Farmers Federation. It may be that the minister has lost touch with his constituency of late because yesterday the National Farmers Federation issued a press release about the Natural Heritage Trust Fund. It was not expressing glowing support for that fund; it said that the future of that fund is up in the air. The ACF, the other body which speaks for the two constituencies most directly concerned with the Natural Heritage Trust Fund, has basically come out and said it is a pea and thimble trick&mdash;the language that was adopted by Kenneth Davidson in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> .</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4432">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only people standing up and saying that this fund is anything other than a deceitful slush fund established for cynical electoral purposes, a betrayal of the election commitments given by the coalition pre-election, are coalition ministers themselves. The only people who stand in the Australian community speaking well of this trust now are the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and his minions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not difficult to get a self-admiring audience from your own backbench, but if you do not speak honestly to the Australian public, it is hardly surprising that the constituencies that are going to be angered by that process get involved in that debate and start to remind the Australian community of the breach of promises that you have made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you go back to `Meeting our commitments', the document that was issued by the now Treasurer (Mr Costello) before the last election, there was a year&hyphen;by&hyphen;year expression of the funds that will be delivered through the Natural Heritage Trust. In the first two years alone, the difference between the promise and the actual commitment is $83 million. It is $83 million short between the promise and the commitment. It is hardly surprising in those terms that the National Farmers Federation and the ACF are unlikely bedfellows in criticising the government for its electoral betrayal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find more than a little amusing the self-deception that this government is capable of&mdash;a government that today, this very day, swept aside the regulations that enabled a previous Liberal coalition government to step in to protect Fraser Island, which we now recognise as a jewel in Australia's natural heritage.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AJ4">Mr SHARP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for North Sydney for his question. He has done a tremendous amount over the last 12 months to try to solve this problem of aircraft noise left to us by the former Labor government. The honourable member for Lowe has also worked very vigorously in this area not only for his own electorate but for people outside it in places like Summer Hill. The honourable member for Bradfield, the honourable member for Cook, the honourable member for Wentworth and the honourable member for Mitchell have also all worked very hard. I cannot forget to mention the honourable member for Bennelong, who has also worked very vigorously in this area to ensure the concerns of people in Sydney are satisfied regarding aircraft noise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think anybody who has an interest in what is going on in Sydney would recognise that the former Labor government left a disastrous mess from its mismanagement of the aircraft noise issue in Sydney. We went to the last election with a commitment to accurately share the noise across Sydney, to put a majority of aircraft movements over water and, where aircraft movements had to be over land, that they would be over non&hyphen;residential areas as far as practicable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also said that we would take into account the fullest public consultation process possible. As a result of that, I am very pleased to announce to the House today that the government has finalised its long&hyphen;term operating plan for Mascot airport. As a result of that, our publicly stated policy commitments of an equitable sharing of the noise and a majority of aircraft movements over water 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> will be achieved. Seventeen per cent of aircraft movements will be to the north, down from some 50 per cent under Labor; 15 per cent of aircraft movements to the west; 13 per cent of aircraft movements to the east; and 55 per cent of all aircraft movements will be to the south over water. In addition to that, there will be a rotation of runway operations to ensure that in the course of the day people will get genuine relief from aircraft noise and that in the course of a week they will also get genuine relief.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the interesting things that comes from this is the fact that, under the new long&hyphen;term operating plan designed by this government, no houses will fall into the 40 ANEF category. Under the former Labor government, some 150 houses fell into the 40 ANEF category. What that meant was that those houses had to be acquired and demolished. Under Labor's mismanagement of the aircraft noise problem and the management of the airport at Sydney, virtually the whole suburb of Sydenham was destroyed. The whole of Sydenham was bulldozed by the former minister, the honourable member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith, Mr Brereton, and his Labor government. Some 150 houses were identified for purchase and demolition under the former government's mismanagement of Mascot airport. Under this plan, the demolition&mdash;the bulldozing&mdash;of Sydenham would have been completely and utterly unnecessary. The $34 million that was spent bulldozing Sydenham would not have needed to be spent. That is one of the extraordinary consequences of Labor's mismanagement, and one of the things that will be drawn out as the benefit of our new long&hyphen;term operating plan for Mascot airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real winners in this are people directly to the north of the airport&mdash;people in the Labor stronghold suburbs of Sydenham, Marrickville, Stanmore, Petersham, St Peters, Leichhardt and Drummoyne, who were unfairly treated by Labor in government and who are being treated fairly by the coalition in government. The one thing that I find so extraordinary about all this is that all of these measures that are now adopted in the long&hyphen;term operating plan for Sydney were available 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4434"> to the Labor government. They chose not to take it up. As a result, they created a disaster for Sydney. They unfairly treated people in Sydney and that led to the demolition of a whole suburb.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

I say to him that he has introduced a certain element of rigor mortis into the transport policy debate. On this particular matter, the honourable member for Melbourne is referring to a NOTAM, a notice to airmen. Indeed there are two NOTAMs. He chooses to refer to one, which says that information that is required in order to ascertain a landing time at Mascot airport can be acquired through speaking on frequency 135.1. A second NOTAM says that you can acquire the same information on the 1800 freecall number. The NOTAM that the honourable member for Melbourne refers to does not state that you can only acquire that information on 135.1. The second NOTAM says you can acquire the same information on the 1800 free call number. It has been interesting to note the enormous hypocrisy in this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Has the minister seen a report in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>  that the Community and Public Sector Union has reversed its opposition to agency level industrial agreements in the Australian Public Service? What is the significance of this decision?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="4434" SPEAKER="Reith, Peter, MP" NAMEID="WI4" ELECTORATE="Flinders" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Industrial Relations; Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for his question. A key element of our reforms in the Public Service has been to abandon the service wide approach adopted by our predecessors and adopt an agency approach to the industrial arrangements within the APS. In pursuit of its claim, the CPSU has been attempting to run an industrial action campaign against the government, although, I would have to say, with very little support from their membership and certainly at a time when they have been losing members. I think one reason people have been leaving the union is that they have been unhappy with the industrial action mentality of the CPSU.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time, our approach has certainly been to talk with the CPSU but also to talk with the rank and file employees within the APS. We have been doing that, for example, at agency level with the service delivery agency. I have been doing it myself, having 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4435"> had 15 to 20 hours of group discussions with APS employees about the way in which we should structure these negotiations. There is no doubt, from the discussions I have had with rank and file employees in the APS, that they welcome the idea of having an agency approach because it gives them a chance to have a say. It gives them a chance to have more flexible arrangements. That can mean that the agency can do a better job and they can have terms and conditions of employment which better suit them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very pleased to be able to say to the House that it has been reported widely today that Wendy Caird, on behalf of the CPSU, has said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the best chance of achieving a good deal for our members is through agency agreements, then that is what we will do . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is a welcome change because there is no doubt that it is in the best interests of her members to adopt the approach that the government announced back in March.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the other interesting development now will be to see the reaction that we get from the opposition. They have, as is usual in industrial relations policy, basically been mouthing the directions nominated by the CPSU and the ACTU. Of course, they themselves in government toyed with the idea of an agency approach, but fell into line with the CPSU with a service wide approach knowing in fact that it was not in the best interests of their members. Gary Johns was on the record at one stage as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A key management responsibility is to develop, with their staff, a culture within their own agencies where all are committed to clear objectives and outcomes. The development of agency bargains can help to focus on this and provide a framework which builds on the broader program budgeting and accountability framework.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is a step in the right direction. I am not under any misunderstanding about the difficulty and complexity of some of the issues ahead of us, but at least this is a big step in the right direction which will ultimately mean a better deal for public servants and a better deal in terms of the efficient operation of the APS. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The remarks that I have made about unfair dismissal laws are based upon a view that the total impact of the existing law, even in its reformed state, is to act as a disincentive on aggregate employment. I would have thought that in its reformed state it is vastly better now than what it was, although in states like New South Wales you still have stubborn, out&hyphen;of&hyphen;date views on industrial relations prevailing at a state government level. It is the responsibility of a government to look at the aggregate impact, and that is what we are doing. That is why we believe that changing the law would increase the employment opportunities of more Australians. It is a view that has been endorsed by the only successful Labor leader in Australia at the present time, and that is the New South Wales Premier. It was a view that was acknowledged by the former Prime Minister in the dying days of the election campaign, and it is a view that is attested to by literally thousands of men and women in small business all around Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Grey for his question and for his interest in this matter. Last October I announced an action plan which allocated roughly $20 million over four years to develop regional mental health services, provide trauma and grief counselling, improve training of Aboriginal health workers and develop linkages with mainstream services. In developing this program we built on the recommendations of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ways Forward</EMPHASIS>  report, which had been compiled by Professor Beverley Raphael and Sister Pat Swan, and worked closely with Aboriginal health organisations, state and territory governments and representatives of Aboriginal and Islander communities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although government can do so much, if we are going to make substantial progress it is going to require more than just government action; it is going to require a genuine partnership across government, the community and I also believe the corporate sector.

The foundation is to be headed by John Moriaty as Chair, a distinguished Aboriginal businessman and administrator. The board of the foundation will be composed primarily of Aboriginal and Islander people who are leaders in their field and have shown a strong personal commitment to Aboriginal and Islander youth.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have certainly seen the reports, and the comments and views of the shadow minister who says that he has seen this agreement. Usually he says that they are secret and that he has not seen them, but I will leave that to one side. In the Australian meat processing industry there is little doubt that we have seen a lack of efficiency which has undermined the opportunities this country ought to be able to provide by way of jobs and export income based on one of our great primary industries. I think the inefficiencies in the industry stem from two factors: firstly, the industrial relations arrangements and, secondly, the level of plant, and in particular the outdated plant.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The management of this particular abattoir, AFC, have sought to address these problems. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> It is a new business. The plant is one of the most modern in the country, and now the industrial arrangements are as well. The company has invested $30 million in the plant. It currently employs 78 people. I am informed that it has expansion plans which would bring another $10 million of investment and another 200 jobs. It is a second supplier to McDonald's, and it is looking to expand its exports to Asia. Quite frankly, those are the things we want to encourage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the reaction of the union puppets opposite? They run the union line that, because the company chose a new form of agreement which avoids protracted negotiations with the union and because the union was not involved, it must disadvantage the workers. Criticism of the AWA is either, to take a charitable view, a result of a lack of understanding or a result of deliberate misinterpretation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, the union has seized on the fact that remuneration of workers previously employed at the plant was based on the notoriously inefficient tally system. But the tally system has no application to the new agreement. The union claims that workers signed under duress, but they were all fully appraised of their rights and the terms and conditions of the AWA prior to signature.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For an AWA to meet the no disadvantage test applied by the independent statutory office of the Employment Advocate, workers must be guaranteed to receive pay and conditions no less than that stipulated by the award taken as a whole. The award is set by the Industrial Relations Commission&mdash;the independent umpire of these matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The key point about the AWA is that, above the award floor, pay is largely determined by production. Workers have agreed to enter into a new more flexible arrangement in return for a better deal overall. The agreement is considered to provide take&hyphen;home pay above the industry standard. The agreement is good for employees, it is good for employers and it is good for regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Encouraging a system which will see the growth of this industry is in the national interest. For regional Australia, in particular, it gives us the chance to see more jobs and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4438"> more export income, which surely is in everybody's interests. It does say a lot about the opposition. They had 13 years of wasted opportunities and jobs lost. Now, as workers and employees get together to try to fix up the mess and to come to arrangements that give people the opportunity to get a job, what is your reaction? Your reaction is to take the propaganda of some union official who has been left out in the cold and use it to attack one of the viable means of actually giving these people a chance of a job in the future.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Herbert for his question. I recognise that not only the honourable member but the people of Townsville do have a particular interest in events in Papua New Guinea and specifically in the troubled province of Bougainville. The Australian government, as I think all members of the House know, is deeply committed to making a constructive contribution where possible to peace in Bougainville. I take the opportunity today to inform the House that a joint Papua New Guinea Australian planning mission recently visited Bougainville during the course of this month to follow up on my decision to provide additional aid directly to support peace efforts on Bougainville.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The mission found that there had been progress in achieving greater stability in some areas of the main island. Importantly, the mission has recommended that Australian aid can support this more peaceful environment through assistance for schools, clinics and district administration as well as training for provincial and district administration. I hope that after the elections, as honourable members will know are about to take place during the course of next month, agreement can be reached with the Papua New Guinea government and also the Bougainville transitional government for an early commencement of what I think will be an extremely important program and a program that can make a serious contribution to the peace process on Bougainville. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4439">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, significant progress is being made on existing Australian funded restoration and humanitarian activities on Bougainville. Reconstruction work in secure areas is progressing well in the health education and infrastructure sectors with major work on a new Buka hospital and the Buka airport upgrade about to start. Australia is the major donor contributing to the Red Cross program. Our support of $4 million is providing urgently needed humanitarian assistance to about 30,000 families across the main island.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I appreciate the interest of the member for Herbert and the trouble he has gone to to ask the question. It is important to understand that Australia continues to encourage all parties on Bougainville to work towards peace. Improvement in the security environment would allow implementation of restoration activities throughout the whole province to the benefit of all.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4K4">Mr ANDERSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. Yesterday in this place I introduced the Wool International Amendment Bill. It represents a momentous occasion described by the ABC today as `landmark legislation'. Indeed, it is with very genuine delight that I can record in here today some very welcome and very substantial good news for this nation's very hard&hyphen;pressed woolgrowers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will see the return of millions of dollars to wool growers out of Wool International. As the member for Hotham, who has a certain interest in this matter, will recall, back in 1993 we assumed there would be no money to return. In fact, we were still worried about a shortfall. Now we know there will be very substantial sums of money made available to growers again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the legislation sets up a process for winding down and then eliminating Wool International. Wool International will go when it has completed its unenviable task of disposing the stockpile. That is enormously welcomed by wool growers the length and breadth of the nation for everything that that represents. It will also provide a range of other services to growers such as financial options so they can make the most of their entitlements&mdash;as I say, a significant milestone in the industry's history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While all of this is happening, I know members would be genuinely delighted to know that after six years of losses and in a circumstance where nine out of 10 of the nation's wool growers are still losing money the markets are showing real signs of improving and may very well break the 700c barrier today. Exports of wool are up a whacking 19 per cent for the nine months ending March 1997. Total exports to China and Hong Kong are up around 30 per cent on last season; Italy up 19 per cent; Taiwan up 23 per cent; India up 26 per cent, and the list goes on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a great deal of hard work put into this by  many members of the government&mdash;the foreign minister, but the Minister for Trade particularly comes to find. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4440"> We have seen very substantial reductions in tariffs on the part of the Indians.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am interested that the honourable member for Batman should have made that passing reference to displaced steelworkers from Newcastle. It may interest the House to know that this morning I met a delegation of representatives of steelworkers from Newcastle, and I understand they also met the Leader of the Opposition. The delegation was led by Mr Maurie Rudd. The delegation certainly spoke to me at great length about the concerns of the employees of BHP in Newcastle and put a number of propositions to me, including the establishment of a task force, about which I have issued a short press release. I indicated to that delegation that I would be visiting Newcastle after I returned from overseas at the end of next month and I indicated, in response to their invitation, that I would be very keen to visit the steelworks and talk to the workers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By far the most interesting comment that was made to me by Mr Rudd, and indeed the delegation, was that, as he put it, `the last thing the blokes are interested in is you and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Labor Party sledging each other on this particular issue'. What they are interested in is an honest addressing of the problems of the people of Newcastle by both sides of Australian politics. It was perfectly clear from my discussion with them, as it would be with any people who have a rational understanding, that what occurred in Newcastle recently could not be regarded as the exclusive responsibility of one or other side of Australian politics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the sort of attempt that is implicit in your question and the sort of attempt that is implicit in the questions of the honourable member for Hotham to pretend that a government that has been in power for 14 months carries exclusive responsibility for developments that were obviously influenced by global factors and also the policies of a government that had been in power for 13 years, all I can say is that that kind of question earns the contempt of the workers you are trying to win the affections of again.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question and would say at the outset that none of us in this place enjoy drought or the impact that it has on rural communities, on farmers, on their land, on their livestock. For that matter, the Treasurer and others do not enjoy the impact that it has on the national accounts. So none of us rejoice in seeing what some farmers go through from time to time. I know that people in the East Gippsland area are feeling considerably upset at the moment about the circumstances that are now descending upon them in what is normally a very safe area from a rainfall point of view. I visited them last Saturday, spent some time with them and heard, anecdotally, their feelings. The observations that they wanted to make to me were put over in a lengthy discussion around a table in Moe.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has been concerned to ensure that we do what we can for people affected by drought. In fact, we have found another $170 million since coming to office for drought assistance. We have doubled the recovery period for people affected from six months to 12 months. We have looked at the eligibility criteria to improve both the understanding of regionality and of effective rain

Of course, we would like to see Australian workplace agreements being made available to people who run small businesses in the New South Wales jurisdiction. The reason that they do not is that the constitutional power at the federal level does not allow us to provide it, and the reason that they therefore are unable to have the advantage of these agreements is that you have a Labor government in New South Wales, like the Labor federal opposition, which is basically against the small business community.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last 12 months, whilst these are not headline issues&mdash;they are not the sort of thing you are going to read about in the newspaper&mdash;this government is working, day in day out, to make these things happen in a practical way for the business community. So we have been making dual appointments in the state and federal jurisdictions&mdash;something that my predecessor would never do, because he would pick and choose on the basis of the political affiliation of the relevant state government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We even reappointed Mr Justice Fisher to the federal commission&mdash;I think even with the support of the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, which shows you how committed we are to a sensible system that will help small business. We are committed to administrative measures like co-location of offices so that when you ring up the inquiry service they do not say, `Oh, sorry, this is the state system. Here is another telephone number. Ring the federal system.' We are going to have one system in a number of states. Why? Not because of the process but because, in the end, this delivers assistance to small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to policy, whilst we do not pick up New South Wales on some things, Queensland, for example, have moved a long way towards harmonising state and federal 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> systems. The good news about that is that it is good for small business. We are pro small business. It is a pity that the hypocrites on the other side cannot realise that some of their policy consequences are costing people jobs.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, the first question that has to be asked is: where is the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore)? This was the discussion gagged yesterday because the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has been hiding from the people of Newcastle. He has told us today that he is finally going to Newcastle, but in a month's time after his overseas trip. We know what is on in England in the last two weeks of June! It is the test match. We have got the industry minister at the casino when he should have been addressing the workers of Newcastle, and the Prime Minister at Lords because he is not prepared to go there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a government that has gagged any sensible debate and has hidden from the people of Newcastle because it has none of their interests at heart. Where is the minister for industry? He was in the House before. He knew this matter was coming on. Is there a new game opening at the casino? Is this where he has gone? Maybe it is the late lunch, but he is certainly taking no account of his responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to know why, in terms of the response to this debate&mdash;we will be interested to see when the member for Hawker gets up, and presumably the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin) is going to be following&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is the only time you have had a chance to speak in the place. I presume the member for Paterson will be up in this place too. Why? Because Paterson was held by the Liberal Party by 600 votes. And there are more than 800 Newcastle families working in the steelworks who live in that electorate&mdash;yet this is a government that has hidden from and washed its hands of the people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that the terms of reference that were given to the member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) actually require him to come back with recommendations on a national steel plan. Why then has the government not sought to engage BHP in the discussion to try and get them to change their callous decision to close Newcastle steelworks, to get them involved in the exercise of being part of that steel plan?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one point that is very important to understand. A nation without a steel industry is a nation without a manufacturing industry. It is also a nation without a defence industry.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without the steel industry of this country we lose thousands of jobs and we lose export opportunity. It defies logic that a nation like ours, with natural resources in iron ore and coal, with leading infrastructure, leading technology and a massive improvement in labour productivity, cannot see itself developing an expanded steel making industry. It would not have happened under Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister has taunted us on the basis of saying, `Don't hold that hope out for the workers of Newcastle.' But let me just say this: BHP presented Labor with this same proposition back in 1983&mdash;the threat to close Newcastle, the threat to also close Whyalla and even the threat to close Port Kembla. Labor stepped in, as it promised to do during the election campaign, and said it would have a plan within 100 days and that plan was implemented. That plan saw massive investment in the steel industry by BHP. It saw a restructuring package for the steel affected centres of this country. It saw the introduction of a steel bounty. But, more importantly, it took this nation from being a net importer of steel to a net exporter. Steel exports over the 13 years of Labor's plan have trebled. Those steel exports are now the largest manufacturing export of this country and they account for 60 per cent of the world's steel. But the decision announced by BHP some four weeks ago sees them reducing their commitment to the export of steel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister wants to talk in this place about how this steel plan of Labor's failed. The trebling of exports&mdash;some failure! What we had was BHP, as recently as 1995, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4447"> recommitting itself to steel making in Newcastle; recommitting itself to keep the blast furnace technology going to the year 2002 and then to invest in the new technology&mdash;the electric arc furnace. There was a commitment to keep steel making going in Newcastle, not 13 years ago but two years ago. The only thing that has changed since that commitment by BHP is the change of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This Howard government has sat limply by and let BHP make a unilateral decision without any commitment in terms of dividend and repayment to this nation. The reality is that when you engage BHP, they will respond. Labor proved that in 1983 and Labor kept that engagement going throughout its 13 years in government. Who has dropped off the engagement? The Howard government. Why can't the Howard government pick up the phone to John Prescott and say, `Let's have a look at the analysis by which you have made your decision to exit steel making in Newcastle. Let's have a talk about it'?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That fact of the matter is this: BHP are still going to invest in steel. In fact, they have even invested in an electric arc furnace. But do you know where that investment is? It is in the US. Newcastle's electric arc furnace has gone to the US. Why has it gone to the US? Because Ohio has offered them free land, a new road, and a five&hyphen;year tax break. And we hear the government say, `Oh, this is a commercial decision.' Some commerciality! The reality is that BHP is going where it is wanted and the signal in this country is that this government does not want a steel making industry. It is appalling that they should take such a stance. The fact of the matter is that BHP made that commitment and we would have kept them honouring it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I heard the other day not only the Prime Minister but also the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) crowing about this new Chinese investment in Western Australia in iron production&mdash;the direct reduction method for iron billets to be developed in Western Australia. If this comes to fruition, this could make feed stock for steel making commercially viable in this country. But what will happen if we do not have steel making? If we do not have the electric arc furnace or the newer 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> technology to convert it, where does it go? Why isn't the government thinking of the strategic link? Why does the government just want this place to be a quarry or an iron exporter? The fact of the matter is: if they develop a strategy that takes those billets at commercially competitive rates and brings them across to the electric arc furnace at Newcastle and then converts the technology developed by Australian investment into a new technology that can cast the metal into strip, we would have a leading edge opportunity to not just be value adding our resource but to be exporting to the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what will happen if the government stands idly by? We will be exporting pig&hyphen;iron again. It will be the only thing that this Prime Minister has in common with his former idol, Bob Menzies. We will have Pig&hyphen;Iron John. The only relationship between any policy approach in his prime ministership and that of the person he idolises is to ship our resource out as pig&hyphen;iron&mdash;back to the 1940s. And he wants to get up here and pretend that what we are talking about is going backwards in terms of policy making. How backward can you look? This is the approach that happens when a government has its hands off the lever, when the government does not believe that there is a role for government in industry policy&mdash;in striking the approach for the strategic direction, in looking for the opportunities and for making the most of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of us on this side of the House have been to Newcastle since the announced closure by BHP. What we have tried to do is to develop a cohesive approach forward&mdash;one that does not just relate to Newcastle, but one that commits this nation to not only retain steel making but also expand the opportunities. What we have talked about in terms of a response to the BHP closure is a two&hyphen;pronged approach. It is essentially that there needs to be a steel plan developed for this nation with particular emphasis on retaining steel making in Newcastle. Also, there should be a strategy to develop the diversity of the economy in the Hunter region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of those opportunities for that diversity has again been nobbled by this government, and that is the decision to invest in the Hunter 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4448"> in the Redbank power station. That project cannot go ahead because this government has abolished the infrastructure bonds which were essential to the funding of that program. They go around making all these promises about how it still might be able to go ahead, but they will not lift a finger to help. Here is a specific example of where economic diversity in the Hunter region can be not only started but also built upon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn to the elements of the steel plan. We as a nation do not want to become just a quarry and a nation that exports its job opportunities. We want to look sensibly at the means by which we limit the extent to which we simply export iron ore. We want to encourage value adding. We want to attract the investment in the new technologies that directly reduce the iron ore into feed stock for steel making. We want to encourage investment in the new technology that makes the steel. We want to invest in the new technology that turns it into strip and makes it available for our other manufacturing industries such as cars and whitegoods. I was at Fisher and Paykel, a whitegoods manufacturer, the other day. They get their industrial steel from Japan. They would dearly love to buy it from BHP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I simply make this point: a nation like ours that cannot put those sorts of things together is not trying. It will not happen without leadership. It is not going to happen on its own. What we want to do is not just concentrate on steel. The environmental pressures on this nation, as well as the international demands, are going to increasingly see requirements for lighter weight metals: the aluminiums and the magnesiums. Again, we have the deposits and the technology, and within the steel making centres we have the skills and the commitment to productivity improvements. The challenge for this nation is to develop a strategy that brings it together and gets us into metal fabrication, not just for supplying our own needs but for exporting. We have the technology. We know we can do it with the mini&hyphen;mills. But it cannot be done without the leadership and commitment from government to encourage the private sector into looking strategically forward.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact of the matter is that industry all around this nation is calling out for a vision for industry policy from this government. It wants to be part of the equation. But what sort of a signal is it when the best the Prime Minister can say when BHP is closed is, `I wish they had rung me earlier, I am really sorry that they did not ring me.' It is absolutely pathetic. Quite frankly, all he has to do to demonstrate some sort of leadership&mdash;and there has been none of it demonstrated in this House over this sitting week&mdash;is to make a commitment to the people of Newcastle, the Hunter and the steel towns around this nation that he is about developing a strategy to secure their future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">BHP's decision will not impact totally for two years. There will be an election before that time and we will be running this campaign constantly and persistently. We believe that this nation does need a steel industry, because that supports the manufacturing and defence industry. But we believe government has to take a role in facilitating the development of that plan, looking at why BHP is prepared to invest overseas and not here; why, when we have invested $130 million in their new project M technology for directly producing strip metal, they are not prepared to apply it in this country. It is ridiculous that we make that sort of investment only to see the technology go overseas because we have run down our capacity as a steel making nation. This nation has invested in the steel industry, it has invested in BHP, and there is an entitlement to expect a dividend. That is only going to occur if leadership is shown by the government, and that is what we are looking for. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must admit I did anticipate that the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) might have realised that he had been given a very good let&hyphen;out when the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) answered a question earlier today and that he would have withdrawn this matter of public importance. It would have saved him the embarrassment of having to talk to something that may have been related. Nonetheless, it shows just how desperate he is, in light of what has been going on in his frontbench, to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4449"> prove to the backbench that the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) is not the one who is really putting a bit of intellectual horsepower into the frontbench.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That performance then was a great disappointment, and I think it shows that the Labor Party have a lot of people sitting there on the back bench who reckon that it will not be long before they will get the opportunity to get on the front bench. Having watched that performance, it was nothing more than the performance of a desperate man. As I say, having been given that opportunity to withdraw this matter, I thought he might have done so before it became a bit embarrassing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to start off by looking at this matter of public importance. It talks about the need for the Prime Minister to go to Newcastle. I will read out what the Prime Minister's statement said today so that all honourable members are quite aware of exactly how concerned the Prime Minister is about what is happening in Newcastle and what he intends to do to try to assist. In part, what the Prime Minister said was that he met a delegation of Newcastle steelworker union representatives to discuss BHP's announcement this morning. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was an opportunity for me to hear at first hand of the social and economic impact of BHP's announcement on the Hunter region.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Prime Minister went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I appreciated the forthrightness of the delegates in describing the effects on families and the local community generally.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He shows that he is a man who is concerned about the people. We listened to this spokesman from the other side. All he can do is talk in misleading statements and often in quite serious half&hyphen;truths, which I will come back to. The Prime Minister went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have agreed to the suggestion by Maurie Rudd that a high level Prime Ministerial Taskforce be established consisting of local community representatives to advise the Federal Government on the implications of any closure for the local community. The Taskforce will report directly to me and will provide the Federal Government with direct feedback from the community in a non&hyphen;party political way on issues affecting the region. Further details of the composition of the Taskforce will be announced shortly. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In his final paragraph he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I told the delegation that I will be visiting the Newcastle steelworks site as part of my visit to the Hunter region in the near future.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There you have it. You had the opportunity to withdraw the matter, but you did not take that let&hyphen;out. Now you have to live with the fact that the matter is rather irrelevant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to take issue with a couple of points. First of all, I think that this man opposite is a fairly miserable little man, given some of the cheap remarks that he made about the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore). He was informed nearly three hours ago that the minister would not be able to be here, for very sound reasons. He is escorting the Vice Premier of the People's Republic of China, Zhu Rongji, to North Queensland. This is a longstanding commitment and the shadow minister knew this. Yet he was so miserable that not only could he not even acknowledge that, but he came out with some snide little comments about why the minister could not be present. Yet he was informed about this nearly three hours ago. That is a measure of the man&mdash;just how miserable he can be when he does that sort of thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me go on a bit further to show you just how desperate he is. He gets up here and makes these great statements about a `nation without a steel industry'. Yet he knows that already BHP have invested $5 billion since 1983 in steel making and furthermore they have planned to invest another billion dollars in the next four years. So what is this about a nation without steel making? He knows that the plant at Port Kembla, the biggest plant in Australia, has just seen a major upgrade of its blast furnaces; he knows that the Whyalla works are just about to see another major investment there. Yet he gets up here and tries to make this totally nonsensical statement about a nation without a steel industry. He knows also that there are steel makers other than BHP operating in this country. Yet he gets up here and tries to mislead the parliament and the people of Australia into believing something that is completely erroneous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also interesting to note that he is not getting a lot of support from his own side. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4450"> Look at question time today. There were no questions about BHP or Newcastle, but instead there were questions bowled up by the opposition one by one trying to be critical of the government's efforts to get small business to employ more people. If he is genuinely concerned about people losing their jobs, you would think he would have been doing a little more to assist small business employ more people. I would have thought the Hunter region was just one region in many parts of Australia that would be very keen to see this happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This shadow minister, the member for Hotham, is getting more desperate by the day. He has been stung by the direct repudiation of his populist sloganeering by the member for Melbourne, his own colleague&mdash;not only another frontbencher but another member from his own home town of Melbourne. The member for Melbourne has really stung him, but it is not only what he has had to say; there have been others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us have a look at what the member for Melbourne did say, because it is very interesting. He warned those in the ALP hoping to capitalise on societal unease and insecurity by offering `a simplistic return to industry protection, tariff wars and tax subsidies disguised as industry policy'. I think he must have been talking about the member for Hotham, don't you? Who else would he have been directing those comments at? It is fairly obvious.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He went on to warn bluntly that to go this way would be `a trip down memory lane arm in arm with Pauline Hanson'. They are pretty strong words from the member for Melbourne and it is pretty obvious where he was directing them because, if you go on and read the article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on Monday, you will find that in the member for Melbourne's warnings he talked about `empty slogans masquerading as commonsense' and made references to Pauline Hanson. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we must avoid becoming economically irrational, lapsing into mindless populism, recycling the policies of the 1950s and defining ourselves by what we don't like. If we adopt such a stance we will be virtually indistinguishable from Pauline Hanson in economic issues. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They are very strong words and there is no doubt that they were being directed fairly and squarely at the member for Hotham.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He ought to be well aware that his own backbench are looking very critically at the way he is behaving over this whole issue and in particular the way he continues to make these totally misleading statements about the steel industry. Tanner went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We cannot afford a return to the 1970s. There is a serious risk that Labor will become a prisoner of populist nostalgia such as that peddled by Pauline Hanson.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He went on to reject a number of things, including Crean's call for the reintroduction of tax breaks for research and development&mdash;pretty strong stuff from the member for Melbourne. I would have thought that it was a very timely warning to the member for Hotham that he had better lift his game or he will find that next time there is a reshuffle he will have a few problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at what another of his former colleagues, John Button, had to say recently. This month on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Science Show</EMPHASIS> John Button was quoted as saying&mdash;and you want to listen to this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I mean, people talk about what the Government should do about industry policy.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I wonder who he is talking about there? John Button went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I don't think the Government should do very much about industry policy. What it should do a lot about in a country this size, is strategic policy, you know, thinking about strategies for wealth generation, community development and so on, in the next decade . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I would have thought that those are the sorts of warnings that the member for Hotham ought to take. Clearly he does not have a very good understanding of Australian industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We ought to look at the way the government has responded to the announcement by BHP. I would make the observation&mdash;and it is a very important observation, because the member for Hotham again tries to mislead the people of Australia&mdash;that this was all announced two years ago. BHP announced that the future of the blast furnaces in Newcastle was limited. And what you do not tell people, of course, is that that was automatically going 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4451"> to mean the loss of a lot of jobs. That was all announced while you were in government. What did you say about it? Nothing.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As you know full well, an electric arc furnace takes about a tenth of the number of people to operate as a blast furnace.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But there are a number of things that this government has already done and I will just run through them quickly because, as you are well aware, we have a bipartisan steel committee set up. I see the member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) is here. He is also a member of that committee, and the committee has been working hard to look at ways and means of seeing what ideas we might be able to come forward with for improving the opportunities for the steel industry. We have also seen the visit by the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop), the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Ronaldson), all of whom have gone up there to have a first&hyphen;hand look to see what they can do, which is, of course, building on exactly what the Prime Minister said at the time when the announcement came through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also seen the work of the local members. They have all been working constructively to try to see what can be done to help Newcastle. As you are well aware, today the Prime Minister met with this delegation and he has given some very positive responses to the concerns that were raised. We have seen the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, announce a major expenditure of $2.15 million in a jobs program. So the government is doing a number of constructive 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> things in developing a response to the challenge in Newcastle. We have also seen the Prime Minister's major projects facilitator, Mr Mansfield, being asked to look specifically at what can be done for the Newcastle area, and so the list goes on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important that we put to rest this nonsense that the member for Hotham keeps peddling, and I will quote from a letter from the head of BHP Steel, Mr McNeilly, to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I want to assure you that we remain absolutely committed to the steel industry in Australia. The plans that we have put in place for the future will ensure that we are world competitive and enhance our participation in the industry.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">If you listened to the member for Hotham, you would think the end of the world was coming when it comes to steel making; yet we all know that in fact the exact opposite is going to occur because we have a steel maker, admittedly the major one but one of several in this country, that has committed itself not only in what it says but also in the huge investments that it has made. When I listen to some of the nonsense that the member for Hotham makes in his statements here and elsewhere, it really does get a bit irritating when you know that it is designed mainly to mislead people and not to have some constructive input into how to deal with the challenges facing Newcastle. There are some very positive things that can happen.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have just named about nine. Weren't you listening? What we see is clearly that the member for Hotham does not have any real understanding of what Australian industry is about. He is really becoming a lone voice and already members of his own frontbench are repudiating him not only within the party but also in the public arena. That is a very serious matter for the member for Hotham and it is something that he ought to reflect on because otherwise I suspect that, when the next reshuffle comes along, he is going to have a lot of difficulty in holding on to his position on the frontbench and then maybe even holding his seat. As has been said before, when we see him come in here with all this righteous indignation, it is all 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4452"> colour and motion but, unfortunately, there is not a lot of substance there. It is a disgrace for the Labor party to allow this sort of nonsense to be continued to be peddled and it really is something that should see the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) pull him into line and say, `Look, it is time you took a more constructive role in this whole matter.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is time that the member for Hotham realised that there are a number of constructive things that can be done for the workers of BHP in Newcastle, and it is time you accepted the fact that all of this was foreshadowed back in 1995 when the Labor Party was in government. The Labor Party had 13 years to do something about this, yet when the challenge came it was found wanting. Now, with the latitude of opportunism in the opposition, we see all these wonderful statements about policies and steel plans and all sorts of things, but I think it is worth recognising that, while the steel plan may have seen some additional investment in steel making, over the past decade the BHP work force in Newcastle has reduced from over 11,000 in 1983 to fewer than 3,000 in 1996.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a great regard for the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker), and it disappointed me no end to listen to the contribution that he made because I know that his heart was not in what he was saying. He was given a poisonous brief to present to the parliament, with not one member of the backbench here with him. He was left here like Robinson Crusoe, like a shag on a rock, trying to defend the indefensible attitude of the government. Let me make clear what is at stake in this. What is a stake in this discussion is the future of the steel industry in Australia, particularly the future of steel manufacture in Newcastle.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For decades BHP has been synonymous with steel in this country. That is no longer the case. With the wonderful natural resources that we have and the tremendously skilled work force, steel is an industry that we should be promoting, developing and leading the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> world in. We have the stability, dedication and application of that work force. But on 29 April this year BHP abdicated their role. So what is at stake here is not the 2&half; thousand jobs of the people inside the BHP gate. There are 2&half; thousand people inside the BHP gate and there are another 7&half; to 8&half; thousand other jobs outside the gate. We are not talking about 2&half; thousand people&mdash;or nonsense as the honourable member for Wannon referred to it earlier, and they are going to like that very much up home when they hear you, Mr Hawker, as the chair of the committee, referring to their livelihoods and their jobs in that way&mdash;but talking about the outlook for some 14,000 families in the Hunter region, right across that region and down into the central coast region. It is not just the 2&half; thousand people inside the gate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the wind&hyphen;down took place in 1982, a lot of people who worked inside the BHP gate were sent outside the gate and became contractors back through the gate and back into the plant. So, overall, those figures of 10,000 jobs in all being involved are quite conservative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to respond to what the member for Wannon said concerning the so&hyphen;called nonsense spoken by the member for Hotham (Mr Crean). He referred to the letter from BHP. Let me put one test on BHP: I will only believe what is coming from BHP on this issue that I can see confirmed from some other independent source and that has been subjected to the scrutiny of professional advice from government departments like Treasury, Finance and Prime Minister and Cabinet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is only way to prove that and that is to produce the McMaster report. On this issue, BHP is judge and jury to itself. Let us understand what BHP is. It is a large conglomerate, imperfect bureaucracy. Like any other bureaucracy, public or private, it makes mistakes and it makes good decisions. In this case they have a record of making mistakes, and in this case we want the cards on the table for examination by an umpire. I say to the honourable member for Wannon that the McMaster report must be made available to you and your committee for proper examin 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4453"> ation by this parliament. Then I might take some notice of what BHP is saying.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Wannon said that you would think that the end of the world is coming. Let me say that the end of the world is approaching for those 14,000 families in the Hunter. It is not just the people inside the gate who are affected; it is all those who service that industry, who service that firm, and all the multiplier effects that flow from the decision. They are not my figures. They are reliable figures from elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has been dragged screaming into the formation of a parliamentary committee to look at the steel industry. Can there be any more important issue for regional Australia than the future of the steel industry? We have iron ore of high quality, a high quality work force which is dedicated, which applies itself and which is skilled, natural resources, proximity to market, a history of being involved in steel and an extensive manufacturing industry&mdash;and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) says, in his most consistent and persistent way, `It is a commercial matter. It is a matter for the corporation.' As his Prime Minister said in 1982 when the coalition turned their back on the industry&mdash;and the then Treasurer and now Prime Minister concurred with the decision&mdash;`It is a matter for the corporation to make up its mind.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This matter of public importance before us today relates to the need for the Prime Minister to go to Newcastle. We welcome that. We want there to be a frank discussion. We want there to be a frank and positive contribution from the government. The Prime Minister should not just rely on what is in his press statement. We want him in the Hunter. We want to talk to him face to face. He should have had some report from his four senior ministers, who have already been there. His mind should not be a sponge; it should not be blank. He has already had four ministers up there collecting information on this for him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to put this on the record for the people of the Hunter. From everybody in the Hunter, we do not want the Prime Minister to have as a starting point that steel making in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Hunter is finished. Everything the honourable member for Wannon has said this afternoon is predicated upon that. Let me tell him that steel making need not be finished. That production facility has a commercial value. It is on the market. There are firms within Australia that would be interested in purchasing that facility as an ongoing facility.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Why do you think I am putting it forward? Of course we want it. We do not care whether it is BHP or BHQ as long as that facility is utilised and those jobs continue. It is the multiplier effect of those jobs that is so important. It is that structure right through the region. Regions like the Hunter, Port Kembla, La Trobe and all of those regions where there are principal industries are the key to employment, opportunities and careers. It is desperate that we have them. A nation without a steel industry is a nation, as the member for Hotham said, without a manufacturing industry and a nation, when the crisis comes, I point out to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott), without a defence industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has to be national leadership, and that is what we want the Prime Minister to give. We do not care if he wants to make some political points out of it, but he should come in and give that leadership to BHP. BHP: you are one corporation. You have a board of directors with all kinds of multiple interests and needs for sitting on boards. Your board membership of BHP is but one job you have. But to the people who work in BHP and related industries in the Hunter it is the only 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4454"> job they have. It is the only income the families have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We want the Prime Minister of this nation to recognise the resources and advantages we have and to give that leadership and tell BHP, `We want this industry as a major industry in this nation.' I am so pleased the chairman of the committee is here. As you bring together your report, we want good, positive leadership. You can never get a better combination of natural resources, skills, location, transport&mdash;astride the national highway grid, astride the national rail&mdash;a deep water port, excellent access and closeness to markets. It does not come very much better than that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When our iron ore and our coal can be taken from the eastern side of the continent in 14 days sailing time to the north, to South Korea, which has similar wage levels, and be processed, manufactured and brought all the way back and sold to us as motor vehicles there is something dramatically wrong with corporate Australia. What is missing in this is the other form of leadership. Where are the corporations of Australia? Where is the leadership coming from the Business Council of Australia? Australia should be coming in and leading the charge into those industries in which we have an advantage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister seeks to trivialise and make a petty political point about the number of people who worked in BHP. To the honourable member for Wannon I say that the work force at BHP Newcastle in August 1982 was 11,560. At the end of June 1983, some 10 or 11 weeks after the change of government, it was 6,582. You lost the work force. It is a petty political point to quote 1982 figures when in fact you were in government. That is a nonsense. Please put your heart into it. We desperately need that leadership from the Prime Minister and for the BHP facility to go on the market. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Quite simply, there are none so blind as those who refuse to see. In political terms, there are none so deaf as those who refuse to listen. More importantly, there are none so wicked as those who seek to deceive, in particular the shadow minister, the member for Hotham (Mr Crean). The shadow minister, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris), the member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) and the Labor opposition really need to face the full force of reality over their current stance to BHP getting out of the steel making game in Newcastle and their pointing of the finger at this federal government to show its hand. The point is that we have been showing it. We have taken the three Ls philosophy of looking, liaising and listening to what is required to help cushion the inevitable short&hyphen;term impact. You could add one more point to that now: we are acting. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is acting. The government is acting with resources equal to or more than the $10 million publicly committed by the Prime Minister on 13 May in a manner that sees Commonwealth money effectively targeted and effectively spent for the highest net benefit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Step one of that process was enacting Bob Mansfield, the government's major projects facilitator, to help identify fast tracking major investment proposals relevant to the Hunter, and to vet projects and initiatives of merit. Both Hunter based Senator John Tierney and I have been right on the pulse with all of this. We have put the best foot forward for the Hunter in areas including the defence industry, fresh labour market programs designed for the tourism industry, a boost to the local agri&hyphen;food sector and, of course, real assistance to displaced steel workers to assist the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Step 2 was the 19 May visit by the ministerial working group for regional affairs led by the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, John Moore, and including the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel, Bronwyn Bishop, the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, John Sharp, and his parliamentary secretary, Michael Ronaldson, who, I am glad to say, is in the chamber at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Community, business and union leaders of the Hunter came together. Their ideas for the future of the Hunter were laid on the table and were graciously taken back to federal cabinet for consideration. That was an act of immense goodwill because, whatever assist 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4455"> ance the Commonwealth provides, it will be money well spent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Step 3 occurred just some two days later when the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Amanda Vanstone, announced $2.15 million in targeted job assistance. The government has created 100 extra new enterprise incentive scheme places for the Hunter, in addition to the 300 already targeted in the budget, with the lion's share, I am glad to say, coming to the Maitland area. To show that politics was not a part of this process, $498,000 was provided for a small business incubator in Cessnock&mdash;in a Labor seat. So this is not marginal seat politics; this is putting the dollar where it best serves. In addition, $150,000 has been provided to support the development of the Steel River industrial park project by conducting a skills audit. And, more critically, $400,000 has been provided to upgrade the metal trades skills of people to take up the vacancies that exist now in the higher technology metal trades engineering operations. As Minister Vanstone said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It offers an effective way to stimulate small business, boost employment and increase the competitiveness of the Hunter.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">With unemployment in the region now having fallen to 11 per cent&mdash;I restate, 11 per cent&mdash;and 2&half; thousand jobs having been created in April, we are back on track to achieve good figures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Step 4: all I will say at this point is `Watch this space.' This government will deliver. It is not going to be involved in a rhetoric war. Today in question time we heard the Prime Minister quite clearly state that the meeting with the delegations with the unions said that they do not want this to become a political football. They are playing football, but let me tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, we wear larger sized boots and we kick bigger sized balls.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The weary line being peddled by the likes of the member for Hotham and by the likes of the member for Newcastle and the member for Shortland is that we need a new steel plan and we need an electric arc furnace as a replacement for the blast furnace coke oven set up at the Newcastle steelworks. The fact of the matter is that it just will not fit the bill. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> The government is not in the business of hoodwinking or deceiving the people of the Hunter and, importantly, I will tell you why. In my hand I have a memo from Mr Andrew Marjoribanks, BHP's Group General Manager, External Affairs, dated 15 May, which really debunks what the Labor Party have been running around saying. In reference to the Newcastle steelworks, the memo reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1995, our expectation was that the workforce would be around 1,000. This number anticipated at the time the continuation of coke ovens and associated facilities and an electric arc furnace.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We do not now plan to operate these facilities, which will now see the work force likely to be more in the order of 600 to 800, which would include the additional jobs in wire.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The point being left behind and being deceived to the broader public is that BHP is relocating its wire making facilities to the Hunter Valley. BHP Group General Manager of Long Products Division at Newcastle, Bob Kirkby, has taken that a step further and made it quite clear that, with BHP Newcastle becoming the centre of the company's wire division, in addition to its rod mill and bar mill it will have a local work force in the Hunter in the vicinity of 1,000 people when an administrative structure is added. So let us do some sums.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With an electric arc, with the called for $600 million to $700 million boost in investment by the ALP, the net job outcome by BHP Newcastle becoming the centre of BHP's wire business will be the same. That's right&mdash;it will be the same. The Labor Party cannot really have an each&hyphen;way bet on this, because simply it is a one&hyphen;horse race.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the Button steel plan, worker numbers at Newcastle fell from 7,300 in 1983 to 5,800 by 1988. At present, they are less than 3,000. According to the document <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The steel plan&mdash;1984 to 1988&mdash;a model for intervention</EMPHASIS>, under the steel plan the Newcastle works today represents something akin to a Dickensian model when up against the state of the 21st century high&hyphen;tech operations of Port Kembla, which produce around three times as much metal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the mystery of wonders surrounding the Button steel plan, BHP's Newcastle 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4456"> operations, with some $870 million in upgrading since 1983, have for some time operated at a major loss&mdash;$30 million for the nine months to February 1997 to be exact. The fact is that plans are only as good as the paper they are written on. It is what emerges from the dry ink that counts. The Button steel plan, at the very best for Newcastle, just held the line. It held the line, and even with an electric arc furnace today&mdash;which it will not get&mdash;the net job outcome at the plant is the very same.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Howard government held up its hand and rolled up its sleeves to help in the transition period for BHP's operations in the Hunter up to the end of 1999. In late June the Prime Minister will visit the Hunter, as announced today, and it will be a visit of substance. The Prime Minister has already said that he will deliver at least $10 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">BHP have given due notice, and it is a decision they will not change. The members for Newcastle, Shortland and Hotham, in seeking to profit politically by preaching doom and gloom in a manner not unlike the Grim Reaper, will not help the long-term prospects of the Hunter. As said today by the union delegation visiting the Hunter, they do not want this turned into a political football.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To predict trench warfare from the trade union movement will not help consumer or business confidence or the recent gains in unemployment now as a region down to 11 per cent one iota. Rather than reflect on the history of the past, we need to look to the dreams of the future. We need to harness the dreams of growth in industries like the burgeoning defence industry sector&mdash;now the biggest employer in the Hunter. We need to make the dream of Williamtown RAAF base becoming a super base a reality, as outlined in the recent defence industry review.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This bill amends the Small Superannuation Accounts Act 1995 to tighten the arrangements relating to the early release of monies held in the Superannuation Holding Accounts Reserve, SHAR. These amendments are consistent with the measures announced in the 1997&hyphen;98 budget reforming current arrangements for the early release of superannuation benefits to members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The budget reforms will apply to savings in superannuation funds and retirement savings accounts and will largely be implemented through amendments to the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Regulations and the Retirement Savings Accounts Regulations. However, to ensure complete coverage of all superannuation savings arrangements, the government has decided to extend the reforms to SHAR.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">SHAR was established to accept superannuation contributions from employers in circumstances where the employer's superannuation fund will not accept a particular contribution because of requirements that fees and charges not exceed the interest earned on such amounts. SHAR is administered by the Commissioner for Taxation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Consistent with the government's retirement incomes policy that superannuation savings should be preserved for retirement, SHAR only permits contributions to be accessed by the individual for whose benefit they are held in the following circumstances:</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the balance is less than $500 and the individual has ceased to be employed by all depositors;</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the individual is not an Australian resident and is not employed in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments contained in the bill will restrict the circumstances when monies held in SHAR can be withdrawn. In particular, the amendments will have the following effects:</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The $500 threshold will be abolished.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The `severe financial hardship' test will be replaced with an objective test of hardship based on whether the individual has received specified Commonwealth payments for a certain period.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> SHAR will be able to release moneys to a person who claims to be a non&hyphen;resident only after that person has reached the preservation age, which is currently 55.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments will take effect on 1 July 1997 but will not apply to withdrawal requests lodged with the Commissioner for Taxation before that date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government considers that these amendments will improve the administration of SHAR and will also address some abuses of the current arrangements. I present the explanatory memorandum and commend the bill to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not go into the reasons for me wanting to speak on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997; I did touch on them briefly up in the Main Committee this morning. I want to refer to provisions to amend part IVA which affect the treatment of withholding tax and which purport to come to grips with avoidance practices. It is proposed to attack withholding tax avoidance by amending part IVA to operate in a way not previously conceivable. To the extent that it will operate prospectively to close loopholes which allow avoidance of withholding tax on non&hyphen;resident interest, dividend and royalty transactions, the proposal is both welcome and justifiable. I am talking about prospectivity. To the extent that it will have retrospective effects, it is to be deplored. It is all the more offensive to the notion of the rule of law because it will facilitate the  imposition of substantial penalties as well as the taxes imposed with retrospective effect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed measures will have effect from 20 August 1996, the date they were foreshadowed by the Treasurer (Mr Costello). It transpires that any payments of interest pursuant to contractual arrangements entered into by affected taxpayers prior to 20 August last year are to be subjected to the full weight of an expanded part IVA. Hitherto, part IVA has only applied to schemes entered into or commenced to be carried out after the date of its commencement, which was 27 May 1981.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The principle that arrangements commenced to be carried out before the date of the proposed amendments' effectiveness is to be breached probably for the first time. Unless pre-existing commercial arrangements can be terminated, taxpayers cannot even choose to make a voluntary payment to expiate their perceived sins and, of course, such a termination may not be contractually possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should perhaps be emphasised that we are talking here about transactions consequential on contractual obligations which were perfect 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ly legal, with equally perfectly legal taxation consequences, at 20 August 1996. Notwithstanding these amendments, relevant payments will not create any substantive liability to withholding tax under division 11A of the principal act. Thus, the only liability which can arise will be when the commissioner makes a determination under new part IVA. The commissioner having done so, it will create a tax liability where none existed previously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On top of a tax obligation which could not possibly have been known at the relevant times, there are substantial penalties. The government is urged to reconsider and limit the application of its measures to payments consequential to schemes entered into after 20 August 1996. There can be no justification for departure from established conventions which restrict retrospective legislation. Apart from all else, applying as it does to transactions concerned with non-resident interest payments, it sends completely the wrong message to foreign investors we at other times seek to satisfy and attract. If as a country we cannot demonstrate certainty under the rule of law, law which eschews retrospectivity, then we have only ourselves to blame.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Taxation Laws Amendment (Infrastructure Borrowings) Bill 1997 currently before us is very important. It is a bill which reflects, I think, some of the very serious philosophical confusions and problems which the government has, especially in dealing with industry policy and economic policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even in the context of the current coalition government being a conservative government, when you compare their actions with those of other conservative governments around the world and look at this bill, you see that we have very serious problems on our hands in terms of the general thrust of this government. The thrust of this government is not merely conservative; it is a kind of reactionary conservatism which has gone to such a degree to the right that it is now actually undermin 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4462"> ing the thrust of other sensible conservative governments. Nowhere is this proved more than in this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at what other governments around the world are doing on the issue of infrastructure borrowings and supporting infrastructure&mdash;indeed, supporting industry in general&mdash;you see that they are working together with private sector to get investment, to get jobs going and to get projects moving. You see action and development. That is what other governments around the world are doing. What is this government doing?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In light of the fact that the government was going to cut so much of infrastructure through the public budget, what does it do to the one major stimulus to infrastructure development it was prepared to put up with&mdash;that is, the infrastructure borrowings law in place to assist the private sector to get into the support of infrastructure projects? It cuts it out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a philosophical issue about whether the public sector or the private sector should do infrastructure development. But this government is so right wing that it has even forgotten about that issue. It is now saying, `We don't want the public sector to do it because we're cutting all that out, and we don't want the private sector to do it because we're cutting out the incentives for them to do so.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is going to happen to this country in infrastructure development? I will tell you what is going to happen, and it was stated by the shadow minister when this measure was announced: $21 billion worth of projects in infrastructure in this country are endangered. And this is a direct consequence of the way in which the government is trying to deal with these matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said before, in looking at the general philosophy behind this, one has to ask, `Where are these people coming from?' First they said we could not have the infrastructure development through the public sector. Then, when you have a project that is going to encourage private sector investment in infrastructure, they take that out as well. Perhaps they think that bridges, roads and railway systems get built by themselves. Do they 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> think that they get built without money, without capital investment?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a very disastrous development for this nation. What are other comparable nations doing? They are putting more money into infrastructure development&mdash;a lot more money. The honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Hatton) mentioned earlier that the Japanese government, having recognised that it allowed infrastructure to run down, is now going to spend $US270 billion on infrastructure development in Japan, which, I remind you, Mr Deputy Speaker, is geographically a much smaller place than Australia. What are we doing? We are saying `Fair enough. That's the Japanese.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the experiences of the other nations in our region. We are talking about these nations so often nowadays. We are saying, `We've got to get into it. We've got to get into the growth pattern. We've got to trade with these nations. We've got to learn from each other. We've got to work together.' What is happening? Those nations are investing in infrastructure as a major national priority. But what is happening with this government? The one project that might have had some chance of getting going&mdash;the infrastructure borrowings project&mdash;because of the fact that they were going to cut all budgets at the state and federal level in terms of government or public support for infrastructure, has been knocked out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If people think that infrastructure development in Australia is sufficient, then they obviously do not understand what is happening and what is required in this day and age. Unless you have railway systems, road systems and efficient networks, industry will not come, especially manufacturing industry. There will not be export trade either, unless you can get your goods quickly from the factory to the port and from the port out into the international marketplace. If you cannot do that, you will not get the export volume. Even if you are producing well, even if your costs are reasonable, you will not get it. So infrastructure becomes a very important matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former federal Labor government, in cooperation with the former Victorian state 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4463"> government, put forward the project of the Western Ring Road and developed that road. Mr Deputy Speaker, you would know that road, coming from your electorate. Funding for the Western Ring Road proposal was mostly by way of public money, but it paid enormous dividends because we now have more industries saying, `We can take advantage of this Western Ring Road development. We can go from the port right across to the industrial areas of Melbourne. If we want to go to Tullamarine airport or to the port, we can have a situation in which the goods can be quickly delivered and exported.' That kind of development involves a lot of money. The infrastructure on the Western Ring Road is a lot of money&mdash;hundreds of millions of dollars&mdash;but it pays off because it is an investment by the people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things that is very strange in the recent economic thinking of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and others in their obsession with budget deficits is that they do not differentiate in the budget between expenses which develop the capital of this nation, such as infrastructure investments and recurrent expenses. Recurrent expenses are not returned, but investments in infrastructure and investments in capital works are returned. They remain as part of the richness of the nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the ordinary householder were to follow the ideas of the Prime Minister on budget deficits, nobody would ever buy a house with a mortgage. They would not buy it until they had the full money to pay for it. That is the kind of economics that the Prime Minister is putting forward, because the government refuses to spend money on those key infrastructure and capital works programs that are absolutely essential to the development of this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to that, we have this ludicrous situation now where even the private sector's efforts to help in the development of infrastructure are to be frustrated, effectively demolished, by the determination of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the legislative import that will be given through this act. What is going to happen is that something which is crucial to the development of the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> nation, namely the infrastructure development of the nation, is going to be severely set back.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government think that they are going to be doing very well with a growth rate of about 3&frac34;per cent. A young, dynamic nation like Australia with all its resources&mdash;and we think we are doing remarkably well with a growth rate of 3&frac34;per cent. What a ludicrous effort. What an absurdity.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="SCOTT" NAMEID="YT4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YT4">Mr Bruce Scott</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is better than you did.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QJ4">Dr THEOPHANOUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Better than we did, he says. The manipulation of facts by your mob is just incredible, but I will not even bother to reply to that nonsense. Let me make a serious point here. We are always talking about the importance of Asian region development. Do you know what the average growth rates in Asia are? More than eight per cent. China's rate is 10 per cent. In some parts of China like Shenzhen the rate is 17 per cent. Meanwhile, Australia is to hang around there at 3&frac34;per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the reasons for this kind of growth rate is the enormous amount of money that is put into the development of infrastructure. Take China, for example. I had the privilege of being part of an unofficial parliamentary delegation that went to China recently, and one of the most amazing things is the amount of construction and building that is going on in China. It is extraordinary. There is a huge building program. You go to a city like Shanghai to the top tower there and, as you look around, all these tall buildings are being built. It is a huge construction program. Around the buildings there are roads, railway systems, bridges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are talking about a massive investment. What is interesting is that this investment is being fuelled not only by the government of China but also by private capital&mdash;from overseas, Minister. In fact, one is just astounded at the figures. China's total capital investment in these areas of power, communications and infrastructure will be $303.4 billion in the next four years. That is the ninth five&hyphen;year plan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is going to happen is that China will modernise and build through this infrastructure its factories, apartments and its housing. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4464"> It is really moving. And what are we doing? We are saying, `Oh, well, we can't build a bridge here. We can't build a road there.' We can't even patch up the road between the capital city and Sydney. Can you believe that  after all these years we cannot even patch up the road between Canberra and Sydney? And we are still doing it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What a ludicrous proposition that in a nation like this the main road between its capital city and the main city in population, Sydney, is still undeveloped. So if some private entrepreneur wants to come in and say, `Look, how about we complete this road?', the answer would be, `Sorry, mate. That wasn't in the projects that got in in the earlier period when Labor was in government,  
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> so bad luck. You can't get into an infrastructure program that is going to help build this road." What an absurdity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I return to the situation of China. I ask the House to ponder the figures with respect to China on power, communications and infrastructure and to consider the ways in which they are developing vis&hyphen;a&hyphen;vis our developments. From this wonderful publication <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">China Embraces the Market</EMPHASIS> put out by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which is worth reading in terms of the comparison of what is happening over there, I seek leave for the table 7.2 `Power and Communications are Top Priorities' to be incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> for reference.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I quote from page 240 of this report:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While infrastructure and environment projects are funded predominantly from domestic sources, overseas entities play an increasingly important, indeed vital, role. Foreign sourced funds' share in fixed asset investment has nearly trebled from 4 per cent in the early 1980s. The Ninth Five&hyphen;Year Plan anticipates foreign capital will account for 15 to 20 per cent of infrastructure outlays in coming years, or approximately US$9 billion per year. The combination of funding sources has changed dramatically in the last two decades away from budget allocations (down from 60 to 3 per cent of total investment) and towards firms' retained earnings (now 52 per cent), domestic loans (from 2 to 20 per cent) and foreign investment (from 4 to 12 per cent).</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is a clear indication that if you have a market based economy and if you are trying to do something with the market, there are possibilities in genuine projects for developing infrastructure. That is what the previous Labor government recognised. That is why they put forward this program. Then, all of a sudden, the program is dead in the water.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you ask what the reason is for this action and you look at the explanatory memorandum given by the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister, Mr Miles, the whole thing is a page and a bit&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;`A great contribution', says the honourable member, sarcastically. What is this supposed to be? It is supposed to be an explanatory memorandum to this House as to the reasons why a major project of national importance has been cut out. And the reason that is given&mdash;the only one I could find anyway in this document&mdash;is:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because of tax aggressive financing arrangements intended to be implemented in association with some of these applications, much of the revenue loss would be captured by financiers and high marginal tax rate investors rather than the intended recipients, the infrastructure projects themselves.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In other words, he is saying that there could be some problem as to the administration or organisation of the program. Is that the reason? If that is the reason, why not fix the problem? Why not reorganise the program? 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Why not ensure that  this lurk&mdash;if is there is a lurk in the program&mdash;does not occur?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what have we had from the government? We have this ridiculous statement in the explanatory memorandum which does not explain anything. In fact, it leaves us up in the air as to why the government did any of these things. It is quite clear that the Australian government have no idea at all about development, either of our infrastructure or of our industry. As I said earlier, that is because they are totally obsessed with this idea that, if you spend an extra dollar or two in the budget, somehow this is some kind of totally unacceptable activity. As I said before, if you spend money on infrastructure and capital works, there remains an asset for the nation which you build on in the future. Therefore, it should not be counted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been suggested many times that we should have two types of accounting in the federal budget&mdash;firstly, the accounting that deals with recurrent revenues and, secondly, the accounting that deals with capital works, with infrastructure and with development of that kind because they are developments which add to the national wealth and which build up the strength of the nation. It appears we will not get any of that but, on the contrary, we will get a situation where not only a program but up to $21 billion worth of projects are taken out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we were not a geographically large country with so many regions and so many needs for infrastructure in those regions you might say, `Well, there is a point to this.' But the fact is that the major impact of these cuts and changes will be the prevention of new projects which would have helped develop the regions of this nation. They could have helped the decentralisation process. We know that if we put in fast trains, if we build good highways, people will move out, for example, from Sydney to Newcastle or other places. People will be ready to make that extra effort if the transport systems are there, if the road systems are there and if the infrastructure is there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Industry in particular will be very impressed. Industry will move to those regions 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4466"> and be able to build the general infrastructure of the nation through these developments.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise also to support the amendments put forward to the Taxation Laws Amendment (Infrastructure Borrowings) Bill by the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) which at least, if supported, will cushion the adverse impact of this bill, particularly in rural and regional Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the upper Hunter, in my electorate, not far from the Warkworth mine, is an empty block of land. There is nothing particularly special about that block of land other than the fact that on Monday of next week&mdash;not the week after, not the month after and not some Monday next year&mdash;there should have been, on that block of land, 200 construction workers beginning to construct the Redbank power station. On this coming Monday there should have been 200 people on that block of land. But they will not be there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On Monday all we will hear on that block of land will be birds chirping. That is all that we will get&mdash;not 200 workers, but a few birds chirping. Why is that the case? That is so because once again the federal government has chosen to sell out rural and regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And where are the National Party members of this place in regard to this bill? I notice that the member for Dawson (Mrs De&hyphen;Anne Kelly) was on the speakers' list&mdash;all on her own. There is a bit of a trend developing in this place. You only need to look at today's speakers' list to pick it up. In fact, I think you will find there are two trends. Firstly, on all these contentious bills that represent an attack on rural and regional Australia and on Australians generally you will find that there are many more speakers on our side than there are on the government side. The second and more important trend is this: on all of these bills, particularly those that impact upon rural and regional Australia, you will find no members of the National Party&mdash;or very few of them.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I congratulate the member for Dawson for coming in here today to do the almost impossible, to defend the indefensible. I do not know where her male colleagues were, but I congratulate her for standing up and having a go. I was in a meeting with the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) and representatives of the BHP work force when the member for Dawson spoke in this place so I missed what she had to say, but I suspect she was very bravely attempting to defend this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At no time in the history of federation has a government deserted rural and regional Australia in the way the Howard&hyphen;Fischer government has. The member for Hotham reminded us that one of the very first acts of this government was to abolish the division of regional development. And what was the response of the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) to all of that? He said that the Commonwealth has no role to play in this very important area of public policy. But, of course, that should come as no surprise to us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As you would know, it was the Curtin Labor government which first chose to involve the Commonwealth in this very important area of public policy. And, of course, it was the Menzies government which tooketh away. It was not until the election of the Whitlam government in 1972 that the Commonwealth once again involved itself. Then Fraser and Howard showed no interest at all, and it took the election of the Hawke and Keating governments to once again pick up the ball and run with it in terms of the provision of policy for regional and rural Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How history repeats itself. Talk about a sense of deja vu. Now we have the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) back once again&mdash;with no complaint whatsoever from the National Party, no voices; they are never in here&mdash;withdrawing the Commonwealth's involvement in the area of regional development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does the member for Ballarat, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Ronaldson) have to say? On the night of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4467"> budget, the member for Ballarat issued a media release. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This year's budget delivers on the government's commitment to regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Well I'll be; I did not notice anything. I noticed a couple of slush funds which are yet to come into effect, but which will certainly come into effect closer to an election year. I noticed a bit of clever accounting&mdash;a bit of a re&hyphen;jig on RAS and a few other things; a few re&hyphen;announcements. I noticed more cuts to the national highway funding which is so crucial to rural and regional Australia. I also noticed more cuts to child care, the impact of which is greatest in rural and regional Australia&mdash;and so on. He then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Specific initiatives that will benefit regional Australia include the new infrastructure tax rebate which will encourage private sector investment in public infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Well, there you go: down from $200 million to $70 million a year. That is the change; that is the big incentive this government is introducing. That has not provided much incentive for National Power&mdash;the company behind the Redbank power station in my electorate. Of course, not only has the funding been reduced, but now we will have people queuing up who should already have been getting money under the previous program. Mr Deputy Speaker, you should not expect that any new projects will be funded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Redbank power station, if it proceeds&mdash;and that could very well be dependent on the future of these amendments before the House&mdash;will, as I said, create 200 jobs in the construction stage; 50 permanent jobs; and, of course, many more other jobs indirectly as a result of the general economic boost in a region with an unemployment rate of 11 per cent. There was to be a stage 2 and, hopefully, even a stage 3, which would have produced many more job opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a project which has the benefits of the previous scheme factored into its budget planning for the construction of the site. Also factored into its contractual arrangements, and already signed with Energy Australia, is the provision of electricity. I will repeat that: the budget for the whole construction project was based on the fact that they were to enjoy the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> benefits of this infrastructure scheme. Likewise, contractual arrangements have already been entered into with Energy Australia for the provision of electricity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this was a private sector organisation which had reneged in this way, Redbank would have had them in the courts for a breach of contract, or in the courts of equity seeking some other form of remedy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to confess to being a little confused. The Howard government appears to believe that the Commonwealth has no role to play in the provision of infrastructure in regional Australia. Yet it does not support the private sector's involvement. So what is the future for regional Australia? By contrast, the Keating government believed there was a role for both. In its 1992 One Nation statement, it introduced the scheme being gutted today to encourage the private sector to involve itself in the provision of public infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1993, when the Kelty report identified some problems with the scheme, the Keating government amended it. It agreed it had some problems; it refined and improved on it, and it built on the experiment.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You do not have to abolish a scheme to address some problems that it might be experiencing. But that is what the government has done. I agree, there might have been a few rorts creeping into the program&mdash;well, fix them; tighten the program. Do not use that as an excuse to virtually scrap the scheme to save the government a bucket of money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to return to the Redbank power station issue. Last week, the member for Hotham visited my electorate, and visited Singleton. I appreciated the fact that the council gave us much of their time to provide us with a briefing on the Redbank issue. The council are a great supporter of the project. They were looking forward to the jobs. They were looking forward to the general lift in economic activity that the project would have delivered for the area. And, as the original consent authority, and having already gone through a New South Wales Land and Environment Court battle over the project and won, you can imagine how angry they are over the fact that the Commonwealth govern 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4468"> ment have put yet another hurdle in the way of the project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They have been happy to express their anger. NBN in Newcastle interviewed Mayor Neil McNamara last week. He expressed in no uncertain terms his anger at the federal government having the audacity to stop this project in its tracks at such a late hour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say that there are not too many paid&hyphen;up members of the Australian Labor Party on the Singleton council. Councillor Neil McNamara is no paid&hyphen;up member of the Australian Labor Party. They are a pretty conservative lot. But they are ready to beat up on the conservative federal government over this one. They cannot believe the audacity. They cannot believe that they would act retrospectively. They cannot believe they would do this to such an important project in their local council area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have dwelt on Redbank for two reasons. The first is pretty obvious and I have said something about it already: it is an important project in my electorate which would have provided jobs. The second reason is that there could be no clearer example or demonstration of the impact of this bill on regional Australia. I want to read to the House part of a letter dated 4 April 1997 from the Development Allowance Authority. I will read the first and last paragraphs. It is to the Chairman of the Redbank Power Company and says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this letter is to advise you, in accordance with section 93P of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Development Allowance Authority Act 1992</EMPHASIS>  as amended (the Act), that subject to you giving the enclosed undertakings I will issue a direct infrastructure borrowing certificate to Redbank Power in relation to the infrastructure facility described in your application dated 19 August 1996, as varied by subsequent correspondence, as the Redbank Power Project.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That sounds wonderful. Redbank gets the green light: jobs coming to Singleton, the upper Hunter and, indeed, the Hunter generally. But the impact is really revealed when you go to the last paragraph, and I remind the House this is a letter dated 4 April 1997:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I should also advise you that if the legislation recently introduced into the Parliament&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is the bill we are debating today&mdash;</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to amend the laws relating to infrastructure borrowings is enacted, any certificates issued by me after 14 February 1997 will have no effect, and will be taken never to have had any effect.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is the consequence of this bill if it goes through this place today, and consequently through the Senate, unamended. The intention of the amendments put forward by the member for Hotham is to knock out that retrospectivity, to give Redbank and those three other very important projects an opportunity to get going and to create jobs in those regions. It could not be any more clear than that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But then we heard from Senator Sandy Macdonald on 20 May. We got a media release from Senator Macdonald in response to the fact that the member for Hotham was in my electorate with me, just highlighting the impact of this bill on the local area. What does Senator Macdonald tell us? In the heading of his media release Senator Macdonald tells us `Macdonald says Redbank can still proceed'. In the Hunter we do not want to hear `can proceed', we want to hear `will proceed'. There is no doubt, after reading to you the correspondence from the Development Allowance Authority, that that is not the case. All it is now is a toss of the coin. And that is stage 1.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what about stage 2? Stage 2 will not proceed because now they have changed the definition of those projects eligible for the scheme and they have made eligible only those projects which relate to land transport. Power stations do not get a guernsey. So it is a `maybe' to stage 1. I think the best you can say about stage 2 and subsequent stages is that they are very doubtful indeed. Let us be very clear about it, that is the effect of this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But this is what the amendments put forward by the member for Hotham seek to do. They seek to knock out the retrospectivity and at least save those four projects, including Redbank in my electorate. I say to members opposite, here is your opportunity to at least cushion the adverse impact of this bill on regional and rural Australia. Those National Party members should be in here defending rural and regional Australia, so I call upon 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4469"> them to get in here and do their job. I commend the amendments to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise this afternoon to reaffirm the support of the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) for the amendments proposed by the member for Hotham (Mr Crean). Of course that relates to the current laws affecting the tax deductibility of infrastructure borrowings. It is an issue which concerns the Labor Party and, indeed, as the member for Hunter has quite rightly pointed out, concerns many who are not card carrying members of our great party. We believe that we have a role in this tax deductibility process because, among many other things, it encourages employment&mdash;something that those opposite clearly believe that they have no role in encouraging.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The original introduction of the infrastructure borrowing tax concession was back in 1992. That occurred under the Keating government's then One Nation statement, extending through to 1994 with the Working Nation statement. The purpose of that tax concession, as has been put to the House by more than one speaker this afternoon, was to encourage private investor involvement in these infrastructure projects. This it did, of course, quite successfully, with the notable City Link project proceeding in Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To ensure that there is involvement of the private sector, we needed to modify the tax system to ensure that the tax benefit of tax deductibility of interest was transferred from the borrower to the lender. This interest was not deductible for the borrower and instead the lender was either not assessable for the interest on income received, or could take a rebate for tax that was paid, equal to the company rate, that being 36 per cent. In this way, superannuation funds were also encouraged to be actively involved in the process, something the current Treasurer (Mr Costello) does not seem to be comfortable with, given the fact that those opposite clearly have an intense dislike of the notion of superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Labor's last year of government we allocated some $200 million for tax concessions for these same infrastructure projects. This would have potentially resulted in some 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> $5.3 billion of projects being undertaken and, according to estimates of the National Institute for Economic Research, would have resulted in the creation of 95,000 jobs for Australians. Of course, not all persons would be employed through the project directly but many would be employed via ancillary and associated industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Considering the amount of concessions set aside by the Keating government, there would have been job creation in all corners of Australia, not only in the Redbank project so dear to the heart of the member for Hunter. Yet under Mr Costello's scheme, one land transport project could take up or eat into all of the concessions available for that budget year and the benefits of employment growth would be very much limited to just one state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the Treasurer's proposals only some 10 per cent of those projects listed for approval, totalling some $22 billion, will proceed and they will be under a far more strict regime than that proposed by the Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to go through some additional impacts of the Treasurer's initiative in this regard. The first I would like to draw to the attention of the House is the fact that there are six projects which had their applications into the Development Allowance Authority before February 1997 and which indeed may now no longer proceed. These include the Bairnsdale crop generation project in Victoria. These projects represent some $350 million of lost investment and job opportunities. There was no apology from the Treasurer for his retrospective action in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All these organisations played by the rules and met all the guidelines, but the Treasurer in his wisdom has decided to go on a wild goose chase for tax rorts instead of focusing on what we believe to be the main game, employment growth. To date no figures have been provided by the Department of the Treasury as to the level of these supposed tax rorts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second impact of the Treasurer's actions in this regard which I cite is the unnecessary legislative transfer of approval for projects from the Development Allowance Authority to the Australian Taxation Office. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4470"> This means that, instead of doing the obvious alteration and allowing the DAA to reject projects which it perceives as having tax aggressive characteristics, the Treasurer in his obsessive mode has brought the tax office into the act. Hasn't the tax office enough responsibilities at the moment following Mr Costello's pathetically weak proposals to limit tax minimisation through the use of family trusts?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third result of the Treasurer's actions in this regard will provoke chaos for those projects well advanced in this training process. Mr Costello has not even considered the proposition of transitional provisions so that those projects with desirable regional development opportunities not perceived to be tax rorts could proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fourth negative impact of Mr Costello's actions in regard to this matter concerns the reduction in tax concessions available to superannuation funds from the existing rebate of some 36 per cent to a possible concession of some 15 per cent, this being the current superannuation tax rate. This is yet another attack on the superannuation industry, which Mr Costello has never been comfortable with and which, in the eyes of many, including myself, he loathes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fifth and final negative impact of Costello's initiative in this regard concerns the restriction in the type of projects eligible to justify land transport, which effectively cuts out power generation projects&mdash;gas and water treatment plants, to name two.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe the Treasurer in this regard has been, in the oft used words of the member for Maribyrnong (Mr Sercombe), penny wise and pound foolish. The government are obsessed with penny pinching on the fringes and they ignore the main game, which, according to those on our side of the House, is employment growth. This scheme has probably had more potential for job creation than all the other fiddles perpetrated by this government, but what really galls me and those on this side of the House is the plethora of ministers who continue to come into this House maintaining that government spending for infrastructure is increasing when it is not.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me highlight some of the cutbacks&mdash;$210 million over four years from local government, $200 million for four years from public housing, $80 million over four years from railway upgrades, $72 million over four years from TAFE colleges and $13 million from Commonwealth major public works. If you were to add these to the other cuts in the 1997 budget, you would have a Commonwealth infrastructure spending level dropping from $3.9 billion to a comparatively paltry $2.95 billion, which is another billion dollars not spent and another 18,000 jobs not created. The total number of potential jobs that the Treasurer has taken out of the economy is 396,000. That is enough jobs to wipe the long&hyphen;term unemployment slate clean in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One can only ask: how much longer will this government continue to treat any assistance to business of this nature as business welfare? How much longer will the unemployed wait for the government to do something about their plight? How much longer will this government abandon its responsibility for job creation to the Reserve Bank and to the markets? When will it finally take the initiative and get involved, as indeed Labor did, with the big picture for jobs?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To conclude, I say that the miserly capping of this infrastructure scheme at $37 million in 1997 terms and then $75 million in 1998 for tax concessions simply indicates that this government has done nothing more than abrogate its responsibilities for job creation and to the Australian people. The people were told that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) wanted them to feel relaxed and comfortable but no&hyphen;one in my electorate feels either relaxed or comfortable. I conclude by imploring the Treasurer to reconsider his proposal, especially as it pertains to the Redbank power station. To that end, I again support the amendments that are to be moved by the member for Hotham.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">The initiative that is before us is holding up a number of important infrastructure projects&mdash;some 75 in total. The government actually allowed two through, and the question that I did ask&mdash;and I would still like the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) at the table to answer it&mdash;is why two of the projects got the tick but no others. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> What is the criteria by which they have been accepted? The reason we are moving these amendments is that it will allow four other projects to get in. We would have liked to have moved an amendment to enable all 75 to qualify but we were advised that that was not technically possible so we are going as far as we can with this piece of legislation by way of amendment&mdash;through the amendments that I have just moved&mdash;and we will be seeking, when the new proposal for infrastructure comes into the House, to amend it so that all existing 75 projects can get a look in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have here a situation in which four important projects are on hold. One of them that I want to refer specifically to is the Redbank power station because, as the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) indicated, he and I visited it very recently and this is of major concern to the community of the Hunter. We know that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is not terribly interested in the Hunter because he is not visiting there&mdash;he still has not given us a date. He is prepared to go to the Test Match at Lord's before he visits the people of the Hunter region to talk about their future. Their future is tied up by the freezing of this infrastructure project, a project which makes economic sense as well as environmental sense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It makes environmental sense because it is a power station that uses coal tailings. It is a power station that, in terms of the technology for generating electricity, is 15 per cent more efficient than others generating in the region. I would have thought, by any standard of sustainable development, that this was the type of project that should go ahead. We have a circumstance in which this project should have been starting two days from now. It should have started on 1 June but it cannot start because this government will not give it the approval. This government have got a senator running around up there saying the project can still go ahead. Why don't they guarantee it goes ahead? Why don't they give it the tick? The government say they are concerned about the future for the Hunter so they should show some concern&mdash;act and tick it. That is all it needs.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4472">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not as if this thing has not qualified. The government has cut it off because of a technicality. It has let two projects in but it has left four out, and we want to know the reason for that. These amendments, if passed, will let the four in, including the Redbank power station. As I say, the project should be commencing stage 1 on 1 June but it will not be because this government has frozen it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be a seminar going on up in the Hunter region in a week or so under the IIIS scheme that is being set up by the government&mdash;they pinched our idea, mind you, and claimed it as theirs&mdash;this being the investment service announced by the government, and those at the seminar will want to know what is happening to the Redbank power station. They will want to know why the government have frozen this initiative. There is also a meeting a week later in Dubbo, and those attending that will want to know why the government have frozen the Orana gas pipeline. We will be saying to them, `Had Labor been in office, these projects would have been going ahead.' I ask the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, who is at the table: where is your commitment to regional development? Don't you understand the importance of infrastructure to regional development?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it gets worse, because even if, with our pressure, we get the first stage up, under the announced guidelines for the second stage it will not be able to qualify. Why? Because it is a power station. And the government said that, apart from reducing the money available for infrastructure funding in the future, they are also going to limit the type of project that can qualify. They will be limited to just road and rail projects. Power stations are out. Telecommunications infrastructure is out. What sort of stupidity is guiding this government in the way in which it makes the decisions? I can actually understand the Treasurer (Mr Costello), because the only thing he is ever interested in doing is cutting expenditure, but why limit the projects that can qualify? <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for the minister's view that these projects can apply under the new scheme announced by the Treasurer (Mr Costello), I point out that they cannot.

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> they will have the opportunity in the second phase. How can they? He has just told us in this House that they can qualify under the new proposal, but the new proposal is limited to road and rail.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the Treasurer has announced and what is going to be brought into the parliament is not just a reduction in the amount of money available for infrastructure; it is what can qualify. I simply say to the minister that he had better get on top of his brief. To come into this place and have to be prised out of his seat to give an answer, and then still be incapable of answering, does raise a lot of concerns about the way this government operates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister is not on top of the brief. He is still over there at the adviser's box now trying to get clarification. I hope he comes back to the dispatch box and tells us what the answer is. This government has had a senator up in the Hunter saying that the Redbank power station can still go ahead, yet it can go ahead only if this amendment is passed and if it does not pass here, we will move it in the Senate and it will be back here to get passed. That is the only way it can go ahead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Out of the minister's own mouth, this project is incapable of applying under the new proposal the government brings forward because it is a power station; it is not a road and it is not a rail track. That is the point that I think this House needs to understand. It is also a point that we will make sure that the residents of the Hunter understand, and there will be a lot of attention still focused on the Hunter because of the refusal of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to go there until after the test match at Lords. There will still be a bit rattling around about the inaction on the part of the government. Here is the chance to do something. Why don't you take it?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a story I would like to read to the House:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When I was thirteen I started contract work. I did not ask to go to work. The white officials just told us we had to go to work and they wrote out a contract for us. My first job was on L. Station, Winton. I was employed to do housework but I had to do everything. Looking after Mrs E's invalid mother&mdash;including bathing her and taking her to the toilet. I did washing, ironing, house cleaning, cooked and served meals, looked after the yard, chopped wood, milked cows, did bore casing, rod placement, water pumping and did fencing with Mr E.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I had to eat my meals from a tin plate and drank from a tin mug, I ate my meals on the wood heap. I was given different food to what the E's ate. Sometimes I was just allowed a couple of eggs&mdash;I was often very hungry. I had a room at the end of the shearer's shed (the shed could accommodate up to 24 shearers, during shearing time). It was small, windowless and there was no lighting. I had a wogga for a bed&mdash;made out of hessian [stuffed with straw], a bag for cover and a potato bag for a cupboard. I was very nervous there especially 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4476"> coming from the dormitory life where we were either guarded or locked up.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was thirteen at the time Mr E wanted to rape me. I rushed around to his car pulled out the shotgun and instead of shooting him I pushed him in the bore tank. He never tried anything else since. I told Mrs E and she told me that it was a lie, that he wouldn't touch a black person. I told the Superintendent at Cherbourg. He wouldn't believe me.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is a submission to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bringing them home</EMPHASIS>  inquiry from page 165. In the limited amount of time I have left I have one more brief story to relate:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When I first met my mother&mdash;when I was 14&mdash;she wasn't what they said she was. They made her sound like she was stupid, you know, they made her sound so bad. And when I saw her she was so beautiful. Mum said, `My baby's been crying' and she walked into the room and she stood there and I walked into my&mdash;I walked into my mother and we hugged and this hot, hot rush just from the tip of my toes up to my head filled every part of my body . . . That was my first feeling of love and it only could come from my mum. I was so happy and that was the last time I got to see her. When my mum passed away I went to her funeral, which is stupid because I'm allowed to go see her at her funeral but I couldn't have that when she requested me. They wouldn't let me have her.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That's another story from the same report, page 156. This House must debate this report. It must be discussed and that must happen to the fairness of the memories of these people as soon as is possible.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="4476"><TITLE>Children's Cancer Research: Ms Hayley Tull</TITLE>
<SPEECH PAGE="4476" TIME="5.35 p.m." SPEAKER="Baldwin, Bob, MP" NAMEID="LL6" ELECTORATE="Paterson" PARTY="LP" GOV="1">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to bring to the attention of this House the story of outstanding courage and determination of a young lady who has just  experienced a very special day. Above us in the gallery we have Hayley Tull. She is a courageous and determined young lady, who is proudly accompanied by her loving mother, Janet, and brother Sean. Hayley is 10 years old and resides with her family, including father Danny, in the township of Stroud, right in the heart of the Hunter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Hayley's courage has come to the fore since she has been afflicted with Wilm's tumour, for which she was diagnosed just last year. The medical definition of Wilm's tumour is one which surrounds the kidney and is detect 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ed when a patient is hospitalised with an abdomen mass, generally after they are not feeling well. Its treatment must begin with surgery to remove the tumour where the level of intensity of post&hyphen;operative care depends how far the cancer is advanced. Whatever its diagnosis, treatment of the cancer includes chemotherapy for up to 72 weeks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Hayley, who underwent surgery at the John Hunter Children's Hospital to remove the tumour, is now in her 48th week of treatment. As Mark Twain once said, `Courage is the resistance to fear, the mastery of fear, but not the absence of fear.' Hayley's courage should be the shining light to all of us to show how she has faced her challenges head on. But today is Hayley's day and I want to briefly explain why.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Late last year Hayley's classmates from Stroud Public School experienced a school adventure which brought them to the nation's capital and to the corridors of power in Parliament House. Sadly, due to her treatment regime, Hayley could not join them. But her classmates did not desert her. They made sure she was in their hearts and on their minds when they came to my Parliament House office and made personal contact with her. It was a special moment as they shared their special day together.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today, as I have said, is Hayley's special day. The experience Hayley's family have gone through with her illness is not an uncommon one in the Hunter. Every nine days a family in our area is told that their child has cancer. Such a diagnosis is always a traumatic experience for any family and the early treatment is usually carried out at the Sydney Children's Hospital in Randwick because of the need for consultations with paediatric oncologists. Children are visited once a month at the John Hunter by their oncologist from Sydney, but such travel plans often do not fit with the ups and downs of the child's cancer illness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To their credit, NBN Television in December this year will contribute their substantial financial and emotional commitment towards helping change all that. The 1997 NBN telethon hopes to raise at least $2 million to build the NBN Children's Cancer Institute. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4477"> The project aims to establish telemedicine links with the Randwick facility. The cancer institute will enable that to evolve and to bring to the Hunter a full&hyphen;time oncologist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Hayley Tull is the special young lady at the front of what is a truly special Hunter community event; that is, the telethon. Her special day did not happen without the support and goodwill of a number of people, just like the telethon is not the success it is without the people of the Hunter digging deep into their pockets to support children's cancer research. I would like to personally thank Jerry McGowan of Impulse Airlines, John Solatta of Newcastle Hire Cars, Rydges Hotel here in Canberra, Nerida Walker of the John Hunter Hospital and Jodie McKay of NBN Television for their contributions to Hayley's special day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To our very own Newcastle Knights, the cast of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hot Shoe Shuffle</EMPHASIS>, local Hunter company Valley Homes, Tom Ford, who has donated the land at Silvan Ridge, and the Disney on Ice production: the 1997 telethon has already reaped real dollars from your generosity. Today, I have been advised that BHP is coming to the party to match, like last time, dollar for dollar the contributions of local steelworkers. This should exceed $10,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I wish to bring to your attention and that of the House why Hayley is wearing a hat. The sad reality is that chemotherapy causes rapid hair loss. Indeed, I think some of my close colleagues have probably already lost theirs in sympathy! Mr Speaker, I seek temporary indulgence to put on a hat as a sign of understanding and acceptance, like so many other children are doing, to show that we understand and to show most importantly that we care. God bless you, Hayley. I hope this was a special day for you.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Retention is also supported by geneticists and demographers, among others, who find identified census information to be of immense value in research and who point out that other countries, such as the UK and the USA, preserve census forms with long&hyphen;term embargoes on their public release. However, the current view of the Australian Bureau of Statistics is that by promising to destroy the original forms people are more likely to provide honest answers to census questions. On the other hand, members of the Advisory Council on Australian Archives have expressed concern that a major reference source is being lost to the nation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, like many members of this House, realise that one of the most important things to happen this week has been the release of the report by Sir Ronald Wilson and his co-commissioners entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bringing Them Home</EMPHASIS> . An extract from the report concerns the story of Jennifer. In particular, I will read a quote about her life growing up in Cootamundra in New South Wales. This is about what was happening to this young girl as she was growing up:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Cootamundra in those days was very strict and cruel. The home was overcrowded. Girls were coming and going all the time. The girls were taught reading, writing and arithmetic. All the girls had to learn to scrub, launder and cook.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mum remembered once a girl who did not move too quick. She was tied to the old bell post and belted continuously. She died that night, still tied to the post, no girl ever knew what happened to the body or where she was buried.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Aunty Esther was a big girl for her age, so she was sent out as a cook to work at twelve years of age. Mum being of smaller build was sent out as children's nurse at fourteen. She had responsibility for four young children; one only a baby for 24 hours a day. Mum said they used to put girls ages up if they were big for their age and to send them out to work on properties. Some girls were belted and sexually abused by their masters and sent to the missions to have their babies. Some girls just disappeared never to be seen or heard of again.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Eventually after several years Mum was sent to Rose Bay to work. Whilst in Sydney she met her sister Esther who was working in the Chatswood area. As far as I know neither Mum or Aunt Esther ever got paid for those hard working years under the Board.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My mother often recalled the joyous time Aunty May came to Kempsey to see her sisters and father. The three young women hugged one another and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cried with happiness and sadness for their sister and their mother.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Early one morning in November 1952 . . . </EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Early one morning in November 1952 the manager from Burnt Bridge Mission came to our home with a policeman. I could hear him saying to Mum, `I am taking the two girls and placing them in Cootamundra Home'. My father was saying, `What right have you?'. The manager said he can do what he likes, they said my father had a bad character (I presume they said this as my father associated with Aboriginal people). They would not let us kiss our father goodbye, I will never forget the sad look on his face. He was unwell and he worked very hard all his life as a timber&hyphen;cutter. This was the last time I saw my father, he died within two years after.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We were taken to the manger's house at Burnt Bridge. Next morning we were in court. I remember the judge saying, `These girls don't look neglected to me'. The manager was saying all sorts of things. He wanted us placed in Cootamundra Home. So we were sent away not knowing that it would be five years before we came back to Kempsey again.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mum used to write to us every week. Sometimes it would be 2 months before we received the letters, of course they were opened and read first. Sometimes parts would be torn out of letters by matron or whoever was in charge.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That gives a very clear indication as to what happened to that young Aboriginal woman and some of the circumstances that have taken place during her life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point I would like to make is that, given the size of this report and the importance of this report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> and parliament can play a very crucial role in ensuring as many Australians as possible have a chance to read extracts from the report. That is why I hope as many members as possible will use their adjournment speeches to read extracts from this report to ensure as many Australians as possible can realise what has happened in Australia in days gone by.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The important thing for us as members of this House is to make sure that we are prepared to face up to the past, to admit what has happened and to try to make sure that we can ensure a fundamental reconciliation with Australia's indigenous people.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Queenslanders have been witnessing some amazing scenes over the past few months as two Labor Party heavies fight for control of the powerful AWU. The present incumbent Queensland ALP hit man, Bill Ludwig, and former federal member and leadership contender, Brian Courtice, have maintained their rage in the daily press. As a result, the papers have even run articles of how Mr Ludwig has avoided his tax obligations. But my concern is the shady deals which may not have made the papers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have documents in my possession which include correspondence concerning a shady deal by Mr Ludwig in relation to his long service leave payments from the union. The amount in question is more than $100,000. But the material I have at hand alleges an even wider net of fraud and political chicanery involving three of Queensland's highest profile ALP figures&mdash;namely, Wayne Swan, former member for Lilley and state secretary of the ALP; the present secretary, Mike Kaiser; along with the former ALP candidate for my electorate, Kevin Rudd&mdash;all Ludwig loyalists. This trio of AWU and ALP executives, while publicly showing loyalty to Mr Ludwig, have apparently been doing deals with Mr John Della Bosca, the New South Wales ALP secretary. They are protecting their own positions in the event Mr Ludwig is rolled. But there is much more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe the accusations being made by me today regarding the former member, Mr Swan, require the closest examination of the government. Mr Swan is officially employed on the staff of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley). Mr Swan is based in Brisbane and is accommodated allegedly in the office of the member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis). Mr Swan is a Commonwealth funded adviser to the opposition leader. From more than one source I am told that Mr Swan has never done a day's work in the member's office. In fact, he works from the state ALP headquarters in South Brisbane and is, in fact, the de facto state ALP secretary. Mr Swan, while being 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> paid by the Australian taxpayer, is in fact working for the ALP. Surely, that is fraud.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have it on good advice that the Queensland ALP supplies his car, phone and fax services at home, along with audiovisual equipment. Even the Australian media reported Mr Swan going to the UK to assist the Tony Blair campaign. But the story from London is that, when he arrived at the British Labour headquarters describing himself as an Australian senior Labor strategist, he had never been heard of. So the British Labour Party put him to work letterbox dropping in Norfolk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question must be asked: was Mr Swan on leave from his job in the opposition leader's office during his UK sojourn, or were the Australian taxpayers picking up the tab for his letterbox dropping activities in Norfolk? Are the Australian taxpayers picking up the tab for Mr Swan to continue to run the ALP? Is the Leader of the Opposition an accomplice in what, prima facie, could be fraud on the Commonwealth? What else are the taxpayers being fleeced for, as this high&hyphen;flying great political strategist continues his work for the ALP and possibly a Senate seat? This is the man who lost one of the ALP's safest seats in the last election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If Mr Ludwig and Mr Swan are what they appear to be, the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Jull) should launch investigations immediately. If the Leader of the Opposition is a party to any defrauding of the Commonwealth, he must resign.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="4479"><TITLE>Australian Labor Party Officials: Queensland

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This week in the parliament a momentous report was tabled: the report of the National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from Their Families entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bringing Them Home</EMPHASIS>. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), in discussing these matters on the floor of this parliament, was certainly in an emotional state. I challenge any member in this place to open this report and to reflect on some of the experiences of those children and not be totally moved by that situation. Those children were forcibly removed from their parents under assimilationist legislation and they suffered greatly for it. I read an extract from the experiences of one of those children:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My mother and brother could speak our language and my father could speak his. I can't speak my language. Aboriginal people weren't allowed to speak their language while white people were around. They had to go out into the bush or talk their lingoes on their own. Aboriginal customs like initiation were not allowed. We could not leave Cherbourg to go to Aboriginal traditional festivals. We could have a corroboree if the Protector issued a permit. It was completely up to him. I never had a chance to learn about my traditional and customary way of life when I was on the reserves.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">None of us on the floor of this parliament would tolerate and, hopefully, none of us on the floor of this parliament would inflict that situation on any of our children or our neighbour's children. As the report says, `Many children were told they were unwanted, rejected or that their parents were dead.' The following is confidential evidence from a person who gave evidence to that inquiry:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I remember this woman saying to me,`Your mother's dead, you've got no mother now. That's why you're here with us'. Then about two years after that my mother and my mother's sister all came to The Bungalow but they weren't allowed to visit us because they were black. They had to sneak around onto the hills. Each mother was picking out which they think was their children. And this other girl said, `Your mother up there'. And because they told me that she was dead, I said, `No, that's not my mother. I haven't got a black mother'.  
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I read another part of the experience of these children who were taken away from their parents which is well documented in this report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was a big poster at the end of the dining room and it used to be pointed out to us all the time when religious instruction was going on in the afternoon. They had these Aborigine people sitting at the end of this big wide road and they were playing cards, gambling and drinking. And it had this slogan which they used to read to us and point to us while they're saving us from ourselves and giving our souls to the Lord. It had, `Wide is the road that leads us into destruction', which lead up into hell. The other side they had these white people, all nicely dressed, leading on this road, and `Narrow is the road that leads us into the kingdom of life or the kingdom of God'.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What a tragedy for the lost generation. What a tragedy for the stolen children. None of us on the floor of this parliament would tolerate that sort of experience for our children. It should never have been allowed for the children of the Aboriginal nation of this country.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="4480"><TITLE>Employment</TITLE>

In my electorate I have a success story where unemployed people are helping themselves to jobs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I was privileged recently to launch the JUICE program&mdash;Join Us In Creating Employment. This program is being coordinated by the Redlands Employment and Placement Service, formerly known as Redlands Skillshare, now known as REPS. Participants in the JUICE program have been using bicycles to visit businesses in the Redlands area to ask if there are any job vacancies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the start of the program, REPS trainers give the participants a course in cold canvassing and tips on presentation. The participants are then loaded into a minibus with the bikes in tow and taken to various parts of the Redlands. And already the JUICE program is showing signs of success.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4481">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the first three weeks, 17 participants found ten unadvertised job vacancies. Since then, 41 participants have identified 103 unadvertised positions. And if the person who finds the vacancy is not qualified for the position, another participant will be offered the job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The JUICE program is the brainchild of REPS manager, John Conley, although, to be completely honest, John varied the idea from our former DEETYA area manager, Lesley Hale. Lesley, formerly from Victoria, mentioned a program she had seen running, in which participants rode motor scooters. John, in conjunction with his REPS team, modified the idea to pushbikes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Through their efforts, REPS secured an $11,000 grant from this government through the local OLMA committee. With this money, REPS purchased bikes from local bike shop owners, Michael and Ruth Usher, at a very good price. And there has been no looking back.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">JUICE coordinator, Wayne Webb, has been quoted as saying that the program is boosting the employment opportunities within the Redlands as well as giving job seekers a confidence and motivational boost. I could not agree more. Motivation and confidence are two of the most vital ingredients in successful job seeking. By working on a daily basis with other self-motivated people, all participants get to improve their communication skills and build their self&hyphen;esteem.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition has no objection to the adoption of the Wine Export Charge Bill and the Wine Export (Consequential Amendments) Bill. These bills provide a method of funding wine export promotion infrastructure, and that has been requested as a levy by the Wine and Brandy Corporation to enable it to undertake research on wine promotion, wine export control and wine label integrity programs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The wine industry in Australia is moving ahead in leaps and bounds. Many visitors to our shores&mdash;including those from traditional leaders in the field such as France and Germany&mdash;say that our product is second to none. There has been a rapid growth in the Australian wine industry in the last 10 years&mdash;exports have grown more than 10 times in volume and more than 20 times in value: from 11 million litres worth $21 million, to 130 million litres worth $471 million. The major export markets were Europe, North America and New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Conditions in Australia are ideal for this industry. We cover a variety of climatic areas, and that allows our industry to develop a unique and special product. Tasmania has been growing wine for many years, but it has only recently become a commercial industry there. There are at least 15 wineries in my electorate of Lyons alone. I have made a good effort to taste each one of the wines produced there so that I can comment when asked what I think about my electorate's wines.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UNKNOWN">Mr ADAMS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not extensively&mdash;one always drinks in moderation and one accepts limitations with alcohol, especially as the industry is endeavouring to promote sensible and responsible alcohol consumption. However, trying to find the right combination of great Tasmanian food products and Tasmanian wine is a great pastime and I find it a very pleasant hobby to have. I have my favourites but, as I said, all of the wineries in my electorate are now producing export market quality wine.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tasmania's biggest problem is producing enough of it. Many people start making wine as a hobby and then realise the industry's potential; others set out deliberately to produce wine on a larger scale. Whichever way it developed, Tasmanian wine has become a very marketable commodity. It has also contributed greatly to the tourism of various areas. There is nothing like going on holiday and sampling the local product in beautiful surroundings. The wine industry has a great opportunity to work in with the tourism opportunities that exist around our country.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4485">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This product is good. Some of my colleagues on the other side of politics have sampled Tasmanian wines at the odd function I have hosted here. I have had no complaints so far. My biggest problem is getting the wine to Canberra. It costs more to freight it here than to buy the wine. I am currently working on improving that situation. Tasmanian wines are certainly available in Canberra but, because of the freight cost, their overall cost is increased.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The idea of raising levies to help specific industries was introduced by the previous Labor government. It knew that the best way of keeping interested parties involved and in control of their industry was to allow them to levy a rate by which they could undertake research on such things as export markets. This has been very successful, and this government has not sought to change the tenure of this sort of scheme&mdash;this levy being one of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does enable primary producers to sort out industry wide problems. One such problem was a difficulty with the French who decided, probably rightly, that here was rather strong competition. The French decided to take on their competitors by restricting the use of the names of their wines. The wines had to come from those areas after which they were named. Wines referred to as champagne and beaujolais have now got to consider a name change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This may, ironically, work in Australia's favour. Name recognition that is associated with the region from where the product is produced could enhance our reputation for excellence and provide a spin&hyphen;off for our tourism industry. People who have tasted Tamar Valley wines, for instance, have come to Tasmania to try the wines at the source. We need to find names that will reflect the places as well as the grapes that this industry grows. I believe that that recognition will, in the long term, be a big plus for Australia and for the different regions that produce wine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe the cheese industry is doing the same thing, taking geographic names and putting that on to their cheeses. Mersey Valley cheese is one. The Bennett family's new cheese factory just out of Deloraine produces another product called Rubicon Red which is unique to the Rubicon, the river that runs through that district. I believe that identification with that district can only benefit it. I believe the wine industry will benefit in the same way and different regions will benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This industry can only grow, and I am glad that Tasmania can be a part of this growth. This is an industry that provides jobs and provides income to the state. I hope that as it expands that governments, both state and federal, will support and facilitate this industry in any way they can. This means making sure that the infrastructure is there for wineries to be successful. Governments must make sure that the necessary transport system is in place. This is particularly the case in Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Governments must make sure that telecommunications are up to scratch so that businesses in the country regions are not under pressure because the marketplaces fail to provide proper access at an affordable price. In many areas the new digital telecommunications is starting to be rolled out in this country. Some of us have a strong feeling that the present government is going to fail to make sure that those roll&hyphen;outs are going to happen in all the regions. If that happens then certain regions will be left behind, and that could have a great effect on the wine industry. Isolated wineries in some regions may not get up-to&hyphen;date telecommunications. To not fit into the new communications world means they could be left behind when trying to market their product and so be locked out of the global marketplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Governments also have the responsibility of making sure Australia takes part in overseas trade fairs and shows. They must make sure that we have the staff to run trade missions 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4486"> overseas. Governments have responsibilities to those who pay taxes and they must be prepared to make those commitments. Governments must also be prepared to help when rural industries are affected by climatic problems. Businesses need room to be able to cope with drought, floods or storms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Assistance schemes must be in place where they are needed. The government should not wait until there is an election looming and throw money at those who might be forced to trade their vote for some assistance, which I think this government is now doing by removing the rural adjustment program and promising, `In the long term, we'll give you something else.' The budget position was that the rural adjustment program was to be wiped out with a promise of something else to come in, in the future, but there was no detail on what was going to come. No doubt as we get closer to an election, there will be some promises to try and buy the votes of people in regional areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This Wine Export Charge bill is helping to make this industry more self-sufficient and I support it in principle but it does not mean that the government has no further responsibilities in helping the industry to succeed. There is a good future ahead for the wine industry in Australia and we must ensure that it is able to make the most of its success. I have pleasure in supporting the bills.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have the pleasure of summing up on the Wine Export Charge Bill 1997 and the Wine Export Charge (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1997 for the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) in this committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, the purpose of these bills is to introduce a charge on the exports of Australian wine to assist in funding the wine export promotion, infrastructure and program of the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is introducing this charge at the request of the wine industry itself. The wine industry proposed the introduction of the charge because it was concerned that the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation would have to wind down its generic export promotion program as grant funding from the state and Commonwealth government came to an end.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The industry strongly supports the corporation's export promotion program and regards it as an essential component of its export growth and strategy. It does not believe that a voluntary scheme would be effective. This charge will ensure continued funding for generic wine export promotion. The charge is expected to raise about $1 million per annum to fund the infrastructure and part of the promotion program costs. Exporters who are participating in major promotions also contribute directly to meet part of the cost. The export charge proposal has been strongly endorsed by payers of the levy to the corporation&mdash;and that is extremely important&mdash;at successive annual general meetings of the corporation in 1995, when Labor was in government, and in 1996. It still maintains that support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has also received many representations from individual winemakers and industry bodies requesting the introduction of the charge. I am sure members are aware that the Australian wine industry is currently enjoying unprecedented international recognition and is achieving rapid growth in exports. It is a great credit to the industry itself that it has gone through a restructuring process and has bitten the bullet and sees its future, not only domestically, but also internationally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The industry has set a goal in its industry plan to achieve annual sales of $4.5 billion by the year 2025, of which exports would make up $2.5 billion. The industry believes that generic 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4487"> promotion of Australian wine in export markets will continue to make an important contribution to the achievements of its goals and is prepared to fund its promotion. Through its support for the wine export charge, the industry has demonstrated it is committed to future growth and the development of its industry here domestically, through exports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that the government and, I am sure, members on the other side of the House wish the industry every success in fulfilling the vision that it has set for itself. It is the industry that is important, it is what the industry wants, and that is what this government is supporting in the introduction of these amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot let the conclusion of this debate pass without making a little comment to the member for Lyons (Mr Adams). He said that telecommunications are also very important if we are to see industries in rural and regional Australia able to make the most of the globalisation of markets. I would just remind that member from Tasmania that Tasmania will benefit to the tune of $110 million in infrastructure specifically for rural areas as a result of the partial sale of Telstra. I am sure that is going to go a long way in Tasmania to updating technology which Labor failed to do in 13 years and this government is doing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just want to make the point that this government understands the needs of rural Australia. Labor had 13 years to do something about it; they did nothing. The state of Tasmania will receive $110 million for infrastructure. In fact, $250 million will be targeted right across rural Australia for infrastructure for the communications upgrade which is so vital, a point the member from the other side of the House did make.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank members from both sides of the House for their contribution to this debate. The wine industry is an important industry. The government certainly supports these amendments and they have the support of the industry itself.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is an omnibus taxation bill containing a range of measures which are generally uncontroversial as far as the opposition is concerned. We will not be opposing the legislation or moving any amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most of the measures are of a specifically anti&hyphen;avoidance nature. In particular, they involve the tightening of the rules concerning capital losses to ensure no abuse can occur where the underlying beneficial ownership of the company group is changed; limiting withholding tax avoidance, including by broadening the general anti&hyphen;avoidance provisions in part IVA to cover arrangements to avoid withholding tax; denying dual resident companies the benefits that they may inappropriately receive through being Australian resident companies; and aligning the treatment of the leasing of luxury cars with the restricted appreciation regime applying to luxury cars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These anti&hyphen;avoidance measures are all supported by Labor. Indeed, some of the anti&hyphen;avoidance legislation that was announced by Labor in the last election campaign was stolen by the coalition&mdash;for example, the dual resident company provision. There is still much legislative and compliance tightening that needs to be achieved to ensure that the better&hyphen;off are paying their fair share of tax. The repair of the tax base, the closing off of loopholes and the pursuit of tax cheats is the type of tax reform that should be undertaken by the government. Ordinary families are paying their fair share of tax; they should not be threatened by the GST or any other tax changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two significant matters in the bill to which I will address some specific remarks: the reform of the withholding tax provisions and the alteration of the standardised contribution rules for employers' superannuation contributions. Firstly, the restructuring of the withholding tax exemption provisions provided for in this bill will allow Australian small businesses, home buyers and consumers to benefit from lower interest rates overseas. The exemptions from withholding tax which now apply for business funds are to be extended to other areas such as home mortgage finance and consumer finance. These changes will lower the cost of accessing offshore finance for non&hyphen;business purposes. This should directly benefit lenders accessing offshore finance and also place further pressure on the margins of local lenders, ensuring an ongoing benefit to all borrowers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor is a strong supporter of this measure, not because we are agreeing with the government's policies in general, but rather because this legislation is enacting a Labor policy initiative. This measure was announced by Labor in the innovation statement of December 1995 and subsequently re&hyphen;announced by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in June 1996, without acknowledging Labor's development of the proposal. An opportunity has also been taken to reform the anti&hyphen;avoidance taxation regime concerning bearer debentures, which Labor does not oppose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, on the superannuation measure, the bill proposes to remove from 1997&hyphen;98 the options for employers&mdash;introduced by Labor&mdash;to make standardised superannuation contributions on behalf of employees, generating savings of $35 million in 1997&hyphen;98 and $40 million in 1998&hyphen;99 and later years. To protect the PAYE tax base, disproportionate deductions are not allowable for superannuation contributions. These are limited on an age basis which recognises that older employees may have higher needs than younger ones.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor introduced a simplified administration option for employers with more than 10 employees, whereby a standardised maximum level could be applied to all employees on whose behalf superannuation contributions are made. This bill proposes to eliminate this option 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4489"> for employers. We will not oppose this change, but the opposition does point out that, as a consequence of this change, the government is consciously imposing higher compliance costs on small and medium sized business, and reducing the superannuation benefits to be accrued by some employees. This continues the double standard of the government which pretends&mdash;and, indeed, has promised&mdash;to reduce red tape and administrative paper work on small business, but is constantly increasing the compliance burden on small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand the government will be moving some amendments. The opposition received copies of those last night. They appear to be geared towards sharpening the anti&hyphen;avoidance provisions. As a consequence, the opposition has no problem with the government amendments and will not be opposing them.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I recall some years ago, at the sort of dinner we often have to go to as members of parliament, sitting next to a gentleman who was a solicitor employed by a very large firm of solicitors that specialised in company law. He not only specialised in company law but also in accountancy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the course of the evening I asked him what he did specifically. He said the only reason for his existence in that department of this very large firm of solicitors was to find loopholes in the taxation act. He said he had a group of three or four people working with him and his sole task, charged to him by his employers, was to pore over the company law act, look at the taxation act and just find holes where his clients could fit through. I think it does no good that some of these very large companies look for ways of circumventing the intention of the taxation act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am always very pleased to talk on bills such as the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997, which is before us, because, frankly, the use of these tactics, whilst perfectly legal, I believe is not morally correct. Anyway, I am very pleased to speak on these bills when they mean that they will be closing off a lot of these loopholes that are being taken advantage of by people who are highly qualified in their field, but who are finding ways of circumventing the intention of the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Probably the most important initiative contained in this bill is in regard to withholding tax avoidance, which was flagged in last year's budget, referring specifically to part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act. These provisions will apply to non&hyphen;resident interest, dividend and royalty withholding tax to greatly minimise the opportunities and, hopefully, eradicate the practices of withholding tax avoidance schemes. The government policy on withholding tax does not change. However, the loopholes will finally now be plugged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another important initiative contained in this bill refers to dual resident companies. The income tax law will be amended to stop dual resident companies that are in essence non&hyphen;residents from taking advantage of their dual resident status by claiming specific tax concessions as a result of their discovering another loophole in the act, which ultimately costs the government and the people of Australia a great deal of lost revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the leasing of luxury cars, the bill also makes necessary adjustments to the act that specifically address the issue of depreciation. I am also very pleased to see another loophole in the act referring to interest withholding tax and other related provisions that are long overdue included in this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other amendments in the bill refer to the transfer and carry forward of net capital losses. This amendment is intended to rectify an anomaly that exists whereby the intended purposes do not occur through the recoupment test for company taxpayers. In other words, as currently 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4490"> applies, capital losses are able to be recouped even though there has been a substantial change in the beneficial ownership of a company since the loss was sustained by that company and that company continues to trade but in a different business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I support these long overdue provisions contained in this bill. I strongly support the minister in having brought forward these long overdue changes.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unlike the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1997, which is about to be debated in the parliament and another tax measure which is being debated in the main chamber, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997 is largely unobjectionable in all but one of its elements. Despite the coalition's rhetoric when in opposition and the Holy Writ of the coalition that it would not impose measures retrospectively, it has once again embarked on a piece of retrospective tax legislation. I am talking about the withholding tax avoidance measure and the new ground to be broken in the application of part IVA.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments which are to apply will have effect from the date of announcement, as far back as 20 August 1996, the date of the coalition's first budget. These amendments will have some retrospective effect in relation to the payment of interest made after 20 August 1996 because those interest payments will have arisen out of contractual arrangements made before the due date, 20 August last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Previously, part IVA has operated only for schemes entered into, commenced or carried out after the date of commencement, which was 27 May 1981. After these amendments, however, part IVA will apply to interest payments which are made pursuant to arrangements entered into before 20 August last year&mdash;those arrangements having been made in a quite legitimate way and, at the time they were entered into, having not given rise to any liability to withholding tax. Such payments, nevertheless, will continue to give rise to no substantive liability to withholding tax, under division 11A of the Income Tax Assessment Act. If that is the case, as I understand it, the only liability which can arise in relation to these payments is when the commissioner makes a determination under part IVA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Short of terminating existing commercial agreements&mdash;and that course is not open to all taxpayers, as you will readily appreciate&mdash;there can be no way for an affected taxpayer to make a voluntary payment of withholding tax in order to avoid the application of part IVA. Taxpayers will not only be required to pay tax on arrangements which were entered into before 20 August 1996, but they will also be open to substantial penalties as a result of the commissioner's application of part IVA. I find that totally offensive and insupportable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The retrospective imposition of both tax and penalties to an arrangement which previously gave rise to no liability should be a matter of great concern to anyone. In particular, it should be a matter of concern to those who have respect for the rule of law. There is no justification that I can find in this case for a departure from the established conventions, and I believe the government, if it was ever sincere about its abhorrence of retrospectivity, should reconsider this measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might say, having indicated already that the rest of these measures are pretty much unobjectionable, that I do find it objectionable that the government has not got a minister here with the authority to respond to my concerns in this debate. I think that is one of the failings of this chamber, if I may say so respectfully and certainly without casting aspersions on the Chair or the Clerks. We simply do not get a summing up of second reading debates in this place, as is expected and is common down in the other place&mdash;although not as common as 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4491"> it should be. I find the absence of a responsible minister in the chair, to respond to very serious concerns about retrospectivity and the rule of law, totally unacceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I close by touching on the measures dealing with so&hyphen;called luxury motor vehicles, and point out that it is acknowledged that the fringe benefits tax, of course, produces concessional results, when compared with employers paying for a vehicle out of their own tax funds in this context. Of course, the measures thereby have some equity; but I am of the view that, if the fringe benefits tax were thought to be a truly equitable tax on the provision of motor vehicle benefits to employees, there should be no reason to apply section 57AF to vehicles that are subject to FBT. The end result of this measure will be that affected taxpayers will rearrange their tax affairs, so that the revenue to be saved or gained as a result of this measure will be diminished. It will simply mean that people will change their behaviour once again; and, in so doing, some will cash out their salary packages accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point I want to make is that the receipt last night of two pages of amendments to the withholding tax and 18 pages of explanatory memorandum makes it impossible to seriously debate this legislation. These matters will have to be raised again in the consideration in detail stage in the other chamber, once again making a farce of the way this chamber is being operated by the government.</PARA></SPEECH>

Any element of retrospectivity in any law is a matter that has to be taken seriously. It is something I would like to revisit at the end of the debate. However, I do not in any way wish to be seen to be ignoring what he said in not taking it any further. Some of these matters are quite complex and I do not hold a candle to the honourable member for Curtin when it comes to expertise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The particular measure before the House, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997, contains a number of initiatives in relation to elements of tax avoidance and abuses in relation to other areas that have been addressed and have been visited with a view to closing those loopholes. Referring generally to those, the bill will amend the income tax law to rectify anomalies in capital gains tax provisions dealing with the carry forward and transfer of net capital losses. These follow announcements in last year's budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the existing capital gains tax provisions, taxpayers can carry forward net capital losses into a later year of income for recoupment against future capital gains which, as with the carry forward of revenue losses, is subject to a number of recoupment tests. These tests prevent capital losses incurred by a company from being recouped where there has been a substantial change in the beneficial ownership of the company since the losses were incurred and the company does not carry on the same business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth while observing that some of the provisions in relation to this area, and particularly the position of companies generally in relation to tax, are somewhat elevated when compared with those of PAYE taxpayers. I will reflect further on that later on. However, it is worth mentioning that companies have at their disposal very high&hyphen;powered legal advice and taxation expert advice.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4492">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is almost a constant movement&mdash;a constant tennis match, if you like&mdash;where one side is looking for a further advantage and the other side, being the government, is attempting to close the loopholes or any abuse areas that are thereby created. The other areas, generally speaking, are withholding tax avoidance, dual residence companies, removal of the standard superannuation contribution limit, leases of luxury cars, interest withholding tax and related provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the issue of luxury car leases, this measure relates to taxation treatment of leases of luxury cars. The cost limit for depreciation of luxury cars was first enacted in 1980 and has been circumvented by leasing arrangements under which the lessor is largely unaffected by the limit. A common technique to avoid this is to ensure that the lessor is a tax exempt or other tax preferred entity, such as a loss trust.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new measures will treat leases of luxury cars in much the same way as other forms of vehicle finance. The lessor will be treated as having disposed of the car to the lessee at the beginning of the lease and as having lent the lessee the money to buy the car. The lessor will be taxed on the finance charge component of the notional loan to the lessee, but not on the actual lease payments. If the lessee uses the car for income producing purposes, the lessee will be entitled to deduct an appropriate proportion of the finance charge component. No deduction will be allowed for actual lease payments, but the lessee will be treated as the car owner, entitled to taxation depreciation allowances. The amount of depreciation allowed will be reduced under the depreciation cost limit rules.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just turning to some of the problems that arise and some of the advantages and tax shields that some of the companies have and, in particular, multi&hyphen;nationals, it is interesting to note the article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly,</EMPHASIS> 17 March 1997. I refer to the "No profit, no tax Japanese multi&hyphen;nationals" article in that particular edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">BRW</EMPHASIS>. In that particular edition it was quite significant&mdash;as the article says&mdash;that the most important national contribution multi&hyphen;nationals make is paying tax. If they do not pay tax, they are, in effect, receiving free benefits from infrastructure and institutional protections.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is quite illuminating&mdash;and this was drawn to my attention by a constituent&mdash;is that in terms of tax payment, there really has to be, as the article goes on to say, a question mark against leading Japanese multi&hyphen;nationals. The Japanese companies in Australia's top 20 foreign companies, excluding Toyota, had a revenue of $22.8 billion, but&mdash;wait for it&mdash;they made a net loss of $10.4 million dollars. As the article goes on to say&mdash;and I pose this as a significant issue&mdash;there are three obvious explanations: the Japanese companies are aggressively buying market share by running low profits; they do not have very profitable businesses, or the true profits are being repatriated to Japan. It may simply be, as the article says, part of the culture of Japanese business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that it is a matter that we, as a government, must very carefully address, not only in the context of the Japanese multi&hyphen;nationals&mdash;that is bad enough when you think of the revenue of that extent and the net loss involved where there is a revenue of that extent&mdash;but across the whole of board of multi&hyphen;national investment in this country. I contrast this with the position of ordinary PAYE taxpayers in this country, in particular, those who might be unfortunate enough to have been caught by the child support system which is also part of the Australian Taxation Office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just the other day, a constituent raised with me an issue of provisional tax. He was running a small business and his liability to pay provisional tax was assessed at $7,000. He paid his 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4493"> provisional tax annually&mdash;as opposed to a lot of other taxpayers who pay it three monthly. That assessment of $7,000 was not brought into account in relation to his child support liability. This is an extraordinary situation where, in reality, his actual income is $7,000 less on account of his liability for provisional tax, yet that was not taken into account in terms of his actual exempt income, for child support purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In effect, his net position is in this extraordinary minus $7,000 position and yet, for child support purposes, the Taxation Office, through the Child Support Agency, will assess him and will penalise him if he does not pay his child support liability&mdash;irrespective of the assessment of provisional tax. I think that is an extraordinary situation which yet again highlights the discrepancies between the Japanese multinationals and the ordinary, average small&hyphen;business, one&hyphen;person operation which has to pay a liability on that basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, it is worth reflecting on a letter that I received earlier this week from someone not in my electorate. Again, it raises the issue that those who are subject, by virtue of a child support liability, to the taxation rigours of the Australian Taxation Office are caught but that those who happen to be a bigger company manage to escape. This particular letter reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I wish to voice my concern in regard to the cost of child support. It is a very big concern not only for me but all separated fathers. The government needs to consider this matter as it affects many Australian lives, and everybody, even separated fathers, should be given a fair go. As the years pass, more and more people are going to be affected by child support. It is a very important issue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Firstly, I would like to state I have no problem in paying maintenance and, ever since separation from my family, I paid child support every week to my ex&hyphen;wife before the Child Support Agency informed me that they must become involved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The separation from my ex&hyphen;wife was not my choice. I love my family very much and thought I would spend the rest of my life with them. It nearly destroyed me when I had to leave my two children. I worked very hard for them so we could own one of many things, a house. I walked away from my family with only my clothes and a few items valued at approximately $500. Everything else I left for my family.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At separation, my ex&hyphen;wife requested that I pay $50 a week for each of my two children. She said that this was ample. Eight months later I received a letter from the Child Support Agency stating that approximately $245 per week would be deducted from my pay. This was based on 27 per cent of my annual wage. I contacted my ex&hyphen;wife in regard to this. She stated she could not believe how much the Child Support Agency was going to deduct from my wage. She said it was way in excess of her needs. She agreed that each month, once she received the payment, she would return to me the amount in excess of the agreed $100 per week. This of course did not happen. Once my ex&hyphen;wife started receiving the payment, she would not part with any of the money.</PARA>

This deeply hurts my pride, as I am sure it would any man. We wish to marry and raise a family, but we are afraid that we will not be able to afford it. The man is the main money earner in most families.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If my ex&hyphen;wife remarries or lives in a defacto relationship, she will have the benefit of another man's wage but I am still required to pay the same amount of child support even though she and my children are being supported by another man. If my girlfriend and I were to marry and have a child, the child support 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4494"> reduced by a mere five per cent. I am currently working 55 hours per week as a transport manager, for which, after child support and tax is taken out, I receive $1,600 per cent calendar month. I am working extremely hard to better my career and hopefully get somewhere in life like everybody wants to do but every time I receive a pay rise or even a bonus, my child support is increased. How can I get ahead at this rate. I do not understand how the government can say that the more money I earn, the more children cost to raise.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Good point.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Child support should be a reasonable fixed amount per child. When the government pays family allowance, this is on a fixed amount per child. This rule should also apply to child support. If parents decide to send their children to private schools et cetera then such expense should be borne as to one half each by the respective parents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I want to be able to provide a home for my children when they come to visit me. I want to be able to purchase toys, clothes and learning equipment for them but, under the present system, it is impossible without the help of a third person such as my girlfriend. I cannot even afford the petrol to pick up my children in Windsor when I have access. The relationship between myself and my ex&hyphen;wife has deteriorated which is due to the cost of child support and the fact that I cannot survive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My ex&hyphen;wife knows I cannot afford 27 per cent of my wage but now has become solely interested in her own well&hyphen;being. My ex&hyphen;wife would have been happy with the agreed $100 per week if it had not been for the Child Support Agency stepping in. Our relationship would still be good and our children would not be affected as they are now by the deteriorated relationship. The men of Australia need your help. Everybody affected is talking about the extremely high rates payable. It has been published in newspapers articles . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That again emphasises the discrepancy between how we can close laws and how we can shore up loopholes for companies that are not paying tax or are attempting to avoid paying it and  ordinary, average PAYE taxpayer who is caught by the system and penalised for his trouble if he does not come into it. Tax reform is a matter that has to be addressed in this country and I am glad to see the debate is widening on that of late.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important that measures like this address the revenue so that we can ensure that that revenue is protected from abuse by those who seek to get around the taxation laws of this country. At the same time we have to consider, in the context of a wider debate on tax reform, just where we are going in this country in relation to tax. I am very pleased that the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) has recognised that need. It is unfortunate that he cannot carry many of his colleagues along with him in that particular enlightenment that has come upon him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, yesterday's men of the opposition are not prepared to look at tax reform in the way that it should be looked at. In any tax debate in this parliament, we should be thinking about tax reform on a much broader scale. If we did have a better taxation system, I am sure that the constant amendments that need to be made to the taxation laws of this country would reduce markedly, and directly in proportion, I would have thought, to the change that is needed to ensure that taxation is fair and reasonable. It needs to cover a fair spread and it needs to cover the multinationals who quite clearly are avoiding tax, in my analyses of that article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS>. This change is also addressing the areas that need to be addressed and it is looking again at the system that I referred to, the iniquitous chid support system. In general, subject to any reservations that I have on any matter that I speak on, I support these measures.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank members for their contribution to this debate and I just foreshadow that, in the detail of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4495"> consideration of the bill, I will be moving some amendments. Firstly, this bill principally contains measures that inhibit certain tax avoidance practices&mdash;that is, withholding tax and the tax depreciation limit on luxury cars, which are largely uncontroversial. I note as an aside that the luxury car depreciation limit is a longstanding one that was introduced by the coalition when we were previously in government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been some comment in the debate about the compliance costs. It is of course very difficult to improve compliance cost outcomes when introducing specific anti&hyphen;avoidance rules. Nevertheless, the government is conscious of the need to minimise compliance costs wherever possible. In this bill, for example, the tax accounting methodology relating to luxury car leases closely reflects existing financial accounting standards for finance leases with a view to minimising the compliance impact. We are certainly well aware of the need to minimise compliance costs, not only for the benefit of the small business but also for those who ultimately pay the cost which is, in many cases, the consumer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Sydney (Mr Peter Baldwin) made some comment in relation to the standard superannuation contribution limit. The member for Sydney said that the opposition would support the measure but said it demonstrated the government's double standards by imposing additional compliance costs on small business. I guess it is just another example of the confusion we have from the other side of the house; they are going to support the measure but then they go and criticise the measure notwithstanding they are supporting it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me assure the committee that the government is concerned that the use of the standard contribution limit has resulted in some rorting where tax concessions were obtained by employers for contributions to a small number of employees that were well above those employees' aged based limits. While the government is always concerned about compliance costs it is not prepared to allow the rorting to continue. I think the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) also raised some issues in relation to retrospectivity and I would like to make some comments on that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is already an element of grandfathering in that it does not apply to payments entered into before the date of announcement. Full grandfathering would send a clear message to the scheme promoters that they can safely enter into schemes without fear of legislative response. While it is true that in 1981, part 4A did not apply to arrangements entered into before that date of normal effect, the existing, at that time, anti&hyphen;avoidance provisions of section 260 would have applied. Evidence has been obtained by the Australian Taxation Office that one scheme in particular involving royalty withholding tax was entered into immediately after royalty withholding tax was introduced in 1992, despite a clear understanding that the Australian Taxation Office would recommend to the government that the scheme was outlawed as soon as the Australian Taxation Office became aware of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the liability of residents for payment of avoided withholding tax and penalty, it is really impossible to recover outstanding amounts from a non&hyphen;resident. The normal withholding tax provisions provide for outstanding amounts and penalty to be paid by the payer, that is the resident as opposed to the non&hyphen;resident. I think that was one of the concerns. A right of recovery is given to the resident to obtain reimbursement from non&hyphen;resident. The schemes often involve agreement between residents and non&hyphen;residents so I trust that the member for Curtin's questions and concerns are allayed by some of those comments that I have made in relation to the concerns that he raised in the debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that the opposition is supporting the measures in this bill. I do want to thank members from both sides of the House. I think that there have been some important issues raised in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4496"> relation to taxation reform and other issues relating to child support by the member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith). It has been a wide ranging debate. I think it is important that we get these measures into place and I do thank the opposition for their support.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">I would just like to outline to the committee the detail of those amendments. The banking and finance industry and the community in general have welcomed the government's initiatives 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4497"> to extend the anti&hyphen;tax avoidance measures to withholding tax. However, some concern has been expressed by the banking and finance industry that the proposed definition of interest contained in the bill could be seen by some as impacting on certain financial products which are not currently subjected to withholding tax, such as interest swapping arrangements where, for example, a floating rate of interest is swapped for a fixed interest rate in order to limit exposure to fluctuations in interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In response to those concerns, the government has decided to amend the provisions so that they more accurately target certain arrangements which attempt to convert an interest income stream into another income form, which some argue is not interest or in the nature of interest. Concerns have also been expressed that the provisions, as currently drafted, may capture some legitimate trading activities, especially those occurring on the secondary markets, instead of targeting arrangements which attempt to avoid the payment of withholding tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once again, in response to those concerns, the government has decided to narrow the effect of the provisions. The definition will therefore concentrate on these arrangements and ensure that the interest component of trade and securities is subjected to withholding tax, where they are sold by non&hyphen;residents to residents of Australia just before interest becomes payable in order to avoid withholding tax. These arrangements are commonly known as `washing arrangements' and are now specifically catered for in the proposed legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed subsection 128F(8) provides an Australian resident company with the option of raising funds free of interest withholding tax, through a non&hyphen;resident subsidiary company. Under this proposed provision, a non&hyphen;resident company can only issue debentures in a country listed in the income tax regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment 2, will clarify that a non&hyphen;resident subsidiary company, for the purposes of the proposed subsection 128F(8), cannot be a resident of Australia. Amendment 3 will require a non&hyphen;resident borrowing subsidiary to be resident of the country in which it issues debentures. It must be treated as a resident under the tax laws of such a country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment 4, defines the term `tax law' for the purposes of amendment 3. The interest withholding tax and related measures, paragraph 5.59, in the explanatory memorandum, will be replaced. The new paragraphs will more fully explain the need to explore the definition of the interest for the purpose of foreign bank provisions of the tax law. These amendments apply from 1 January 1996 and I present an explanatory memorandum.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understood that we had an agreement with the government that the minister at the table and I would speak on this matter briefly, given that we have come to an agreement about this legislation. I am sorry to say that that does not seem to have emerged. Nevertheless, we will keep our side of the bargain. I will keep my comments brief and would appreciate if the government speakers would do the same.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not go much for this idea that it is everybody's right to speak in a democratic parliament if the government continues to move the gag. I think we need a little bit of sensible discussion about these issues and, when we have an agreement, they should be implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the case that Labor does not support people who cheat the social security system. As members of the government would know, when Labor was in government, we did introduce a series of measures to tighten the social security system, using a range of data matching techniques, which I might remind the government they opposed with some vehemence when they were in opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the case that those few people that do cheat the social security system give all social security recipients a very bad name. Our side will support tight fraud and compliance controls in the social security system. It is also very important that, in any arrangements for pursuing compliance, we strike some sort of reasonable balance between being tough on fraud and compliance and also being realistic about the effects that any of these penalties might have on the individuals concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite clear that the original penalty regime that was announced by the coalition in the 1996 budget did not strike a reasonable balance. Quite clearly, the government has come to this view as well as a result of pressure by the opposition and a range of other community groups. Under that regime, the government proposed that people who breached the activity test by failing to attend an interview with the CES, for example, would get no payment at all for six weeks for a first breach or no payment at all for 13 weeks&mdash;that is three months&mdash;for a second or subsequent breach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only Labor was concerned with these very draconian changes that were proposed by the government. We saw the welfare rights groups strongly advocating on behalf of unemployed people that these were draconian changes that would leave people without any form of support for, as I say, up to a period of three months. Welfare Rights have put forward publicly a number of case studies that showed the very practical effects of imposition of long non&hyphen;payment penalties. We are talking about eviction, people being driven to beg and steal. These are the realities of people not having any form of support for periods of two or three months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will be supporting the government's amendments here today because, in our view and in the government's view, these amendments do establish an activity test penalty regime which although it does still act as a significant deterrent, does not leave people without any income for long periods of time. What the new regime will do is see an 18 per cent reduction in payment for 26 weeks after a first breach. There will be a reduction of 24 per cent in payment for 26 weeks if there is a second breach&mdash;and as no doubt the government will point out, fortunately, most people only breach once&mdash;and then eight weeks non&hyphen;payment for a third or subsequent breach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the case that the government has made significant concessions. I have to say it would be appropriate that for other people who are suffering, particularly as a result of last year's budget, in nursing homes and child care, maybe we could see similar sorts of concessions. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4499"> Nevertheless, the government has made significant concessions in this area. In particular, we are seeing that first and second breaches now are going to be served by way of a rate reduction to their payments rather than facing a non&hyphen;payment period. The third or subsequent breaches will incur a penalty of eight weeks non-payment, not the 13 weeks that was originally announced by the government in the 1996 budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We support the government's proposal to see that everybody starts with a clean slate from the introduction of the new arrangements. That will see the breaches count for up to a two-year period rather than the three-year period that had been previously the case. We are supporting the government's amendments and we are pleased that they will not have the same serious effect that they would have had on unemployed people if the 1996 budget decisions had been pursued.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak in this debate on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Activity Test Penalty Periods) Bill 1997. The particular measure that has been introduced is a responsive one. When I say `responsive', I mean it responds to consultations that have occurred since the announcement in the budget. In that budget the government announced a range of measures to tighten the administration of the activity test applying to unemployment allowances and in doing so did meet a specific coalition commitment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The range of measures that were announced did receive, as has been mentioned by the minister in his second reading speech, considerable community support. That community support stems from the fact that the community has to pay to the revenue, by virtue of the taxation system, and that money is then collected and disbursed to various areas including the social security area where there is almost $1 billion a week paid out at the present time. With that sort of money involved, the collection and then the disbursement of that money, great care has to be taken to ensure that those who are receiving the benefit of taxpayer funded allowances do not abuse the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a sense, in my view anyway, social security really is in the nature of a privilege. It is not a right. It is in the nature of a trust. It is a contingent right that depends on you being honest. Provided you are honest in your claim then you have met the demands of the social security legislation and also the demands of the community. Nobody in the community minds paying for those who are less well&hyphen;off. Obviously it is extremely important to ensure that those who, through no fault of their own, have fallen through the safety net and find themselves in need of support by the social security system have those needs met to the extent that the system meets those needs where all else fails.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, nobody in the community minds meeting that particular need for those less fortunate. What people do mind&mdash;and I have in my electorate received many calls about this matter&mdash;is people who are abusing the system. Measures that meet the abuse of the system mean that those who do abuse the system are properly dealt with to prevent them from re&hyphen;offending. It is a fact that 89 per cent of people who breach are first-time breachers, 10 per cent area second-time breachers and only one per cent are third-time breachers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is my view that when one is dealing with even those sorts of statistics it is important&mdash;and those are the breaches that are identified I should say&mdash;to remember that there is a group of people out there who are prepared to repetitively abuse the system. It is more than abuse; it is fraud. When it is repetitively done, then it needs to be met with the full force of the law.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4500">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the Department of Social Security, it is important in this area to ensure that the system that they operate in relation to breaches is a careful monitoring program. If it is not, then sometimes people are caught up in it that ought not to be caught up in it. There has been some experience of that through my electorate office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say this in terms of a wide-ranging comment that where the Department of Social Security does make an error and misleads a person, then it ought to take responsibility for the making of that error, just as the person who abuses the system needs to be dealt with as firmly as the law permits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These measures before the House, I think, are a sufficient deterrent particularly when one looks at the fact that the community is still concerned to crack down on social security fraud. When it comes to, on the other side of the coin, problems in the office of the Department of Social Security, I get the impression that that office does not like to meet a case against it. It likes to try to duck and weave.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know&mdash;and certainly I do from my experience at the bar&mdash;that people obviously do not like to meet the consequences of their action. When they have to, it is not a pleasant experience, particularly in relation to imposition on the Commonwealth charges which come under the Crimes Act and which flow from breaches of the Social Security Act and other pieces of federal legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have had a recent example where the Department of Social Security only and solely by its actions induced someone to go onto a pension in circumstances where that person did not have an entitlement. He had provided all of the documentation, but he went to a seminar and was induced to go onto a particular pension. He was told three years later that he had to pay back $36,000. Already, the Department of Social Security in its letters in relation to this matter is trying to say, `Well look, while we have made a mistake, he ought to have known anyway'. In my view that cannot be justified.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While this is a debate specifically on activity test periods, I do say that when it comes to difficulties within the department's administration, the department also has to meet its obligations to the community. If it makes a mistake, it should be first to put its hand up and say, `That was a mistake. We misled you. We are responsible for the consequences of that misleading.' Just as, on the other side of the coin, when people make not only mistakes but deliberate misrepresentations in relation to their stated position, their identity or their receipt of income from other sources, they are met with condign punishment. It is absolutely clear that anybody who breaches their obligations to the department will be charged and prosecuted. It is also in that area that I have some words for the Department of Social Security. It must be very careful&mdash;</PARA>

The figure changed three times.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By the time it went to court, the matter was agreed at about $8,000, from memory, to be paid back, when it had started at somewhere around $27,000. But, extraordinarily, after the

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. But the fact of the matter is that, at the end of the day, it is important when we are dealing with people who are offending against this system that they are dealt with properly and that quantum of the amount that they have imposed on the Commonwealth is the predominant factor in what sentence is imposed. On the other side of the coin, it has to be realised that if that quantum is not clearly established, an unfairness could be perpetrated. So, in all of the circumstances, I just issue what I suggest is some caution to the department when it is dealing with breaches and with quantum of amounts outstanding.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as the bill is concerned, I agree with the amendment; I think it is a responsive one. It gets back to what I believe is the overall philosophy of the government: that this is in the nature of a trust; people put their trust in those seeking social security to be honest and to make full disclosure; and they demand, when than honesty is not forthcoming, that the appropriate deterrent is imposed. In those circumstances, I think the government has met the needs of the community, as well as upholding the notion that those who have fallen through the safety net do warrant being treated fairly and reasonably by the system.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Activity Test Penalty Periods) Bill simplifies matters for both those who receive and those who administer unemployment benefits. Anything to cut through the red tape of bureaucracy has my full support. And any change this government can make to improve the lot of the unemployed members of our community and, more specifically, of my electorate of Griffith is to be applauded.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill also resolves what I believe was an unnecessary hardship imposed on defaulters. In the past, people receiving dole payments who breached their contract were deprived of payment altogether. All social security case workers I have met have expressed concern at this measure, and I do not believe that such a harsh deterrent was ever necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the intention of all our programs is to assist the unemployed out of the dole queue and back into the work force, I believe that the changes as laid down in this amendment are equitable. This amendment ensures that no-one is left without a payment, albeit one that has been reduced. Under this legislation, dole defaulters will now face an 18 per cent cut to their benefit for 26 weeks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another confusing aspect of the existing penalty system is the sliding scale by which the default penalty is assessed. It depends on the length of time a person has been receiving unemployment benefits. This confusion is eliminated by this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The message in this amendment is clear and concise: if you do not show any interest in seeking employment, despite the best efforts of your case worker, you will suffer a reduction in your dole payment. It must be said at this point that the social security case workers and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4502"> the officers of the CES are cautious in the extreme in imposing breach penalties. By the time a person has incurred a penalty, they have usually made one thing quite clear&mdash;and that is, they prefer to live on the dole rather than follow up potential employment leads.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But this government also recognises that some breaches are unavoidable. This bill ensures that breaches will only apply in cases of voluntary unemployment, or when the dole recipient has shown no intention to fulfil the employment contract due to misconduct. The breach rule will also apply to those voluntarily leaving employment or being dismissed because of misconduct. That a breach penalty is necessary is borne out by the reaction to the current system of total withdrawal of payments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my electorate of Griffith, three per cent of the dole payment recipients are subject to breach penalties, and only five per cent of those are second time offenders. Under this amendment, the streamlining of the activity test breach penalties also applies for those who breach a second time. In this instance, the rate reduction is a more stringent 36 per cent for 26 weeks; but I understand an amendment to be presented later today reduces this to 24 per cent. As with the first penalty, this percentage is across the board and made clear from the word go. Also the length of time the offender has been receiving payments is removed from the equation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While this amendment ensures that unemployed people are not left without any payment at all, it sends a clear message. That message is: the dole is not a salary. We have had to acknowledge the fact that some people do not genuinely seek work. That so many have managed to adopt a lifestyle of leisure on government handouts, to me, is a tragedy. I believe that this is due in part to the welfare policy of the previous government. Was it their intention to create a society dependent on government support? Judging by the massive increases in the cost of welfare, we were all well on the way to doing just that. The resultant tragic legacy is a generation of healthy, energetic, young people who expect government support as a first resort&mdash;not when all else fails.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, that is not a program the community can afford without sacrifice. The previous government in its role of the all caring benefactor not only sent the community broke but also fostered the attitude that welfare handouts are a right&mdash;not an assistance to get through hard times. Anyone who denies this does not spend time with young people who are unemployed, most of whom call the dole their `pay'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A clear result of this is the lack of young people working their way through the trades. It is now literally impossible to get a small building job done in Brisbane in under 12 months. The cry from builders is that they cannot find experienced carpenters. Many other tradesmen make the same complaint.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to make dramatic changes to our attitudes. We have to remember that welfare is not a right; it is a sign of an economically viable country. Our common goal must be to be able to provide sustenance and accommodation for those who, through circumstances beyond their control, have met with hard times.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a community, we now no longer applaud the fact that we are able to meet most welfare needs. Instead, we complain that welfare payments are not high enough. Of course they are not. No government handout will ever be adequate for a comfortable lifestyle. Unemployment benefits are not intended to&mdash;nor can they&mdash;replace a worker's income. Therefore, we have to improve the administration of unemployment benefits, while offering people better options.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4503">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We must engender confidence in the young people who are energetic and who need to be in the work force gaining skills for their later life. Those who take unemployment benefits but who do not persevere in their goal to find work cannot expect the community to support them forever. But this government certainly does not like to see anyone left without a payment in their hands, which has been the case in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I support this bill on the grounds that it does not leave a person without some income, and also because it simplifies the system for those on both sides of the social security counter. At the same time it sends, I believe, a very clear message&mdash;and that is: the dole is not a salary; seeking employment must be the first priority.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak today in support of the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Activity Test Penalty Periods) Bill 1997. The changes that will result from this bill, I believe, are that we will see reductions in a person's rate of allowance for first, second, third and subsequent breaches of the DSS activity test within a two-year period, as outlined earlier this morning by other members.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For some people these penalties may seem to be heavy-handed, but for others they might not seem to go far enough. I believe that these measures are tough but fair. Certainly, hypothetically, if I ever found myself in a position where I was unemployed and receiving income support benefits, I would be making damn sure that I did not breach my activity test responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this sense, I believe that this debate goes back, in part, to the need to provide disincentives for people to be stuck on unemployment queues. It also goes to the heart of a community feeling that recipients of government assistance should be prepared to help themselves, to play by the rules and to actively seek employment. Whether we like it or not, there are some people who make unemployment a way of life. Whether we like it or not, there are some people who find it easier and more comfortable to pick up a fortnightly social security payment rather than find a job. This has to change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recall a recent interview of the Treasurer (Mr Costello); I think it was on a Sydney talkback radio program. He was asked by one caller why unemployment payments were not equal to the minimum wages of workers. Mr Costello replied that, if that were to be the case, there would be no incentive for people to find work&mdash;and he was absolutely right. We should not be providing people with incentives to drop out of the work force. We should be framing our social security system in ways which remove the incentives for that minority of people who want to stay on the dole to be able to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) and I were talking last night with</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Owen Jones, from the Townsville regional group apprenticeship scheme. Mr Jones has a wealth of experience in employment training, apprenticeship courses, youth training, and so on. He was saying just how essential it is to get young kids leaving school either into work programs, such as apprenticeships and traineeships, or into higher education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Jones said that the worst thing we can do is to let them get a taste of what it is like to receive a fortnightly unemployment payment for next to no effort in return. He said that, after a few weeks or months of young people effectively getting something for nothing, the government and society face an uphill battle to turn them around and to instil in them a work ethic and to impose discipline.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4504">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is why the government is introducing a work for the dole program. The expectation within mainstream Australia today is that, where appropriate, something should be given back to the community by the people whom the community supports when necessary. Likewise, the expectation within mainstream Australia is that, when a person breaches or breaks their activity test in relation to Department of Social Security payments, some sort of penalty should apply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A few weeks ago, my office in Townsville was contacted by local business manager Laraine Rissel. Ms Rissel had a couple of casual kitchen&hyphen;hand job vacancies at award wages for a couple of days a week. Ms Rissel was reported in a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Townsville Bulletin</EMPHASIS> article as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All the employees need to do is a little bit of food preparation . . . helping get chickens off rods&mdash;maybe serving somebody, washing up and wiping the floors down.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The article went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . only one applicant contacted her before lunch the day the advertisement appeared.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"More called after lunch and I ultimately interviewed 16 people," she said. "But none were interested."</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Reasons for refusal included not wanting to wash the floors; not wanting to wash the dishes; touching chickens made them sick; one was concerned she might break her nails; and another refused to work until 8 pm on the grounds her boyfriend might need her before then."</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">When Ms Rissel called my office, she was totally frustrated because she had also contacted the Townsville CES and asked them to send some people down for job interviews. No&hyphen;one showed up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Being in receipt of unemployment benefits should not be a cakewalk for people. The incentives need to be there for people to actively go out and look for work. That people today should dismiss so easily and trivially the offer of work, as in the instance outlined by Ms Rissel in Townsville, is incredible. The changes being debated in this bill may not directly change that, but I hope that they might tighten up activity test compliance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) said earlier, no member of any party&mdash;government, opposition or otherwise&mdash;condones the practice of social security fraud. Governments have a responsibility to prevent fraud and cheating of the system. That is why I support the changes to be implemented in this bill in this respect.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Activity Test Penalty Periods) Bill, but I confidently predict that, if the government is supported in the Senate&mdash;and not frustrated, as too frequently happens&mdash;by minority parties and the opposition, we will soon have reforms working in our economy and in our society which are designed to improve incentive, and to overcome the mentality, which some people are inflicted with, that they have no future. These reforms are designed to create new jobs and to give people security and confidence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that context, I hope this legislation goes through quickly but, on the other hand, I believe that if the government's whole policy approach is supported, we will not need to access the legislation which I now support because fewer and fewer people will be in the mould of not wanting to work and of taking advantage of the rules.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was a clear message from the electorate during the last election that a mandate should be given to the government that was prepared to tackle abuse of unemployment benefits. Unfortunately, a few people make it bad for many. There is no doubt about that. Let me recount a brief story. I was at a factory in Benalla, in my electorate, recently. The factory has 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4505"> a turnover of some 30 per cent of staff, and unfortunately many of them are at the younger end of the group. They disappear from the factory when the warmer weather arrives in the north and the winter arrives in the south. Guess where they go? They go north. This was reported to me by a reliable operator of a medium sized industry, whom I respect, and he was prepared to back it up with information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation is designed to put pressure on people who do not believe they have a responsibility to their country and who think that they can abuse it. Support for people in need and for the disadvantaged is something that we are all proud, as Australians, to help develop and to support governments to deliver.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> On the other hand, there has not been enough debate in this country about the fact that all of us who are in need from time to time and who do get a helping hand also have a continuing responsibility, despite difficulties, to make a contribution ourselves in whatever way we can to ensure that the country is enhanced and problems do not get worse. But there is a group of people&mdash;a minority group&mdash;who do not accept that and who believe that they do not have to put in an effort.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are plenty of stories of people who say that there is work out there provided that you have got enough get up and go, and that you work assiduously at it. On the other hand, I have been with families that have lost their children due to suicide, unfortunately. I am reminded of a young male person who hanged himself after a job interview&mdash;about his 150th over the previous three years&mdash;when he did not get the job. There is no doubt that there was a connection, such was his despair and despondency. We cannot cast all people who are not able to get work as people who are not out there trying.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The majority will not be worried about it and will support it. I honestly believe that the majority of Australians, no matter what their political colour is, support any government that is willing to try and make people realise that the taxpayer makes a big sacrifice to pay taxes to a government in order to help people in need, and we are glad to continue to do that. But we will not, and should not, tolerate, as a parliament or as a nation, people who get away with doing things that do not involve them honouring their obligations. That is simply it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to say, too, that I believe that a number of government initiatives, including the work pathway to improve the apprenticeship system and using schools to stimulate kids and to train them in their senior years as they go into year 12 in part&hyphen;apprenticeship training systems, are fantastic ideas and I am very excited about them. Thirty per cent of our kids drop out from school in years 9, 10, 11 and 12 and many of those young people become the long&hyphen;term unemployed. Some people, a minority, will be affected by this legislation. Unfortunately some of them will become part of the youth suicide statistics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the problems, of course&mdash;and the government is addressing this and I hope all members will support the government on this&mdash;is that the kids are dropping out of school 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4506"> because of dysfunctional families, pressure, and the fact that they are not stimulated in some way by the curriculum. They do not feel that there will be a job at the end anyway, so why hang in. The government's approach is to introduce vocational training in the schools, so that kids can walk out of year 12 with a VCE certificate that says quite proudly that they are part qualified in their trade training and know that they will have a better chance of getting an apprenticeship, a trade and a skill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From the same factory in Benalla that I referred to, I learned that they cannot get fitters and turners. This country, with 800,000 unemployed, cannot find enough skilled tradespeople. What a paradox. These are the challenges that the government faces.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I recently had the pleasure of spending some time with a program in Long Beach, California. It was established by the federal, state and local governments, the community and McDonnell Douglas, after McDonnell Douglas retrenched 25,000 people&mdash;a pretty disastrous situation for that community. I learned a lot from my visit and I have a lot of information available on how they tackled the problem of people being retrenched, unemployment, training, morale, physical fitness, keeping people involved, and the team approach. It is a fantastic story and I have got a lot of material which I am happy to share with members of parliament from any side and the community, and I intend to make some speeches in parliament over the next few weeks about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They have a sort of activity test, and I do not know whether we would approve of it or not; but let me tell you that they have just introduced some software whereby, as the person involved in the program goes from case manager to interview to training program, they have an identity card which is swiped with a barcode. That means that automatically the case manager has for retrieval on the screen all of the steps that they are taking, who they are seeing and the phone and fax numbers. When they see their case manager for a review, the case manager is up to date: he can ring the person they saw, because he has their phone and fax number and the like. It is actually a positive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people working in the system, on the other side of the desk, actually wear the same sort of identification, so it is not seen as, `You're one and we are the other.' They are all in it together. They also have a fitness program which impressed me greatly. All the people in the scheme actually become involved in a regular fitness program, because you cannot go out and fight for a job when you have had a kick in the guts, if you are not fit: you have to be physically fit to keep your morale up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They do a lot of good work there, and there are some good examples that we could use. The other thing they do is head&hyphen;hunt. The Yanks head&hyphen;hunt more than we do. They actually ring successful people up from Detroit and say, `You're the best car manufacturer,'&mdash;or foreman, supervisor or whatever&mdash;`and we have got some fantastic people over here. We want to use you for six months. We have spoken to your boss and he is reluctant to let you go, but he said okay.' These people come over and they get to know the people in the program, and they actually ring their contacts across America and Canada and say, `I've got the finest people involved in your particular skills; and I believe that, with your expansion program that I know about because I am in the industry, you could fit them in. So, what about seeing them for me?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They have also got a system where each person has their own little office with a phone. They are allowed to ring anywhere in America free of charge to arrange job interviews, and to discuss and find out how they go about things. There is a really positive attitude to helping these people. The one&hyphen;stop shop program which our government is introducing&mdash;where 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4507"> everybody can go in to the one place, with a case manager and the works to bring all the talent together to help people&mdash;may well become as successful as the program in America appeared to me to be. I emphasise again that I am happy to share this information with members, if they would like.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I welcome the opportunity to continue for a short time in relation to the Social Security Legislation (Activity Test Penalty Periods) Bill. We do have to look at all of these measures in the legislation in this context. Whilst, on the face of it, they appear pretty negative and can seem a bit harsh to some people, the measures should be seen in the context of everything that we can do to make people's lives better and to enhance their future and give them more opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation is not in isolation from what the government thinks should happen. It is one of a whole range of things that need to be done: issues such as the pathway program, the modern apprenticeship scheme and the like&mdash;and maybe some of the Long Beach, California systems that I am speaking about. If we do all of those things well enough, there is nothing that will stop us from getting people who want to work an opportunity to work in the future. I believe that very strongly, and I continue to argue for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make one final plea. The mood of the electorate is obvious: all members of parliament can read it. There is a lot of discontent and unhappiness about what is going on. I believe a lot of it is directly attributable to the way in which the Australian Senate is frustrating a government with a strong mandate to deliver its reform programs.</PARA>

No&hyphen;one can tell me today that, for young kids out in the real world&mdash;some of whom are in the mould of those who have lost the incentive to work and do not think they have got any future&mdash;the poor performance of the previous government over 13 years has not made an indirect contribution towards their state of mind.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had the pleasure last night to address the 300&hyphen;odd shop retailers from Westfield Parramatta. They spoke to me about how they were fearful about taking on young Australians because they were not sure what their future sales were going to be and what the long&hyphen;term projections were. Even where demand was good for a period, they were reluctant to take people on because the legislative framework that the previous government had created represented a massive barrier to new employment, especially for young Australians. In western Sydney, we have borne the brunt of Labor's mismanagement and the exclusivist ACTU mentality of, `Me first and the rest of you can look after yourselves.

It is not being done by building massive bureaucracies and gazebos and castles in the air here in Canberra; not by us featherbedding our own nests and guaranteeing our own security here, and not by us erecting more and more barriers to new employment in order to ensure our own guaranteed long&hyphen;time tenure and security.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4509">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is about breathing incentive and life back into an economy which has been struggling under Labor for 13 years. That is where we come back to the subject matter of this bill. It is about preserving the fundamental integrity of the provision which governments make for those in need. And those who have the greatest ire, if you like, for welfare cheats and for fraudulence in the welfare system are not generally the rich, but those who are just a couple of income bands above the welfare recipients. They are the ones who are on $25,000, $30,000 or $35,000 a year, trying to support themselves, a family, a couple of kids, and pay off a mortgage. They are the ones who resent getting up early in the morning, commuting to work, spending all day on the shop floor, going home at the end of the week absolutely exhausted and knowing that they are only a relatively small distance ahead of others who, in a minority of cases, have made no bona fide effort to turn their own situations around.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I stress that it is a minority of cases. Nonetheless, unless you address that minority of cases, unless you can go to the Australian taxpayer, to that breadwinner earning $25,000, $30,000, $35,000 a year and trying to support a family on it, and say to him or her, `We are seeking to ensure that welfare goes to those who are genuinely in need,' then you create deep divisions within the community. In fact, unless you take the sorts of steps that we are now taking as a government, you actually create deeper and deeper divisions in the Australian community, because those in employment will begin to deeply resent those who, for one reason or another, are beneficiaries of welfare and transfer payments; and anyone who is receiving a benefit from the government will tend to get tarred with the same brush as the minority who are rorting and abusing the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have to go forward to the Australian people with a sufficiently clear set of principles upon which a person receives welfare. If those principles are breached, it is an entirely moral, correct and appropriate response to breach the ongoing payment of that benefit. Unless you do it, in the long run the people who suffer the most are in fact the worthy recipients, because they are branded with the most pejorative language and lumbered with the most intense loathing from the rest of the community who feel that the payments are unjust.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) is in the chamber. He has taken steps to ensure the integrity of the existing immigration program without which the whole program would be called into question by the population as a whole. The Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) is doing the same thing in this vital area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is nothing more destructive to a person's life than to actually acquiesce in their abuse of welfare. In fact, the person whose life is most badly affected is the person who accepts a very low quality of life, a very poor standard of living, but who accepts it nonetheless as a chosen lifestyle. That person has got to be, in a sense, rescued from their own indulgence. That is where governments have to ensure that when we are expending taxpayers' funds, we are doing so for a pretty compelling reason.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to remember that every one of the $140 billion&hyphen;odd which the Commonwealth spends has to be taken out of the private economy. To fund our annual budget of roughly $140 billion, that money has to come from somewhere. There are 2&half; million people in western Sydney, many of whom are on modest incomes; but they are paying their way. They are the PAYE taxpayers who are getting slugged by us, week after week after week, and they want to be pretty sure that the money we are spending is appropriately targeted and is achieving the objectives for which it was spent. When I talk to people all around Australia they say to me, `I don't resent paying taxes. I resent waste. I do not resent people in genuine need receiving some support. I resent those who make a lifestyle of it.'</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4510">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All members ought to be able, unequivocally, to support and uphold what we are doing here today. It is a moderate step, but it is nonetheless an important step. It has a practical dimension and it has a symbolic dimension. It is a long overdue reform. I note that the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, has introduced similar provisions in the area of employment benefits. Those who are helping young people find jobs say that this has provided an excellent stimulus, an excellent prod, a useful little discipline to get people focused on the job at hand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was noteworthy that when we introduced higher levels of enforcement for breach in relation to unemployment benefits, a large number of people simply dropped out of receiving the dole altogether. That is a reflection of the fact that, if you are going to pay benefits to target a particular social outcome, you have to ensure that they hit the target. It is no good spraying bullets all over the place and hoping that one or two of them hit the mark.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those bullets are the privately generated dollars of the mums and dads out there who are struggling to make ends meet. We have a grave moral and public policy obligation to ensure that those dollars go to those who are genuinely in need. That is the purpose of the bill, that is why I am supporting it, and I urge other members to do the same.</PARA></SPEECH>

The first, following discussions with the opposition as I have mentioned, is that changes are made by amendments 1, 6, 8 and 13 to the penalty periods applicable where a person breaches the activity test. The penalty for the second activity test breach is reduced from 36 per cent rate reduction over 26 weeks, to a rate reduction of 24 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, the penalty for the third or subsequent activity test breach is reduced from 13 weeks of non&hyphen;payment to an eight&hyphen;week period of non&hyphen;payment.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Second, changes are made by amendments 2 to 5 and 9 to 12 to clarify the intention of the provisions relating to the application of the activity test penalty period, whether rate reduction or non&hyphen;payment in respect of breaches that occur before a person claims an unemployment payment.

Since its inception, the federal government has provided annual funding of about $1.5 million to provide marketing and other support activities for Australian horticultural industries, to assist in their export promotion activities, and to get the industry focused on exports. This funding is due to run out in June 1997. There are a range of horticultural industries which participate in the Australian Horticultural Corporation by way of a statutory levy. The industries cover apples and pears, oranges, avocados, chestnuts, stone fruits, dried vine fruits and macadamias.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been some industry concerns expressed about the high cost of participating in the Australian Horticultural Corporation. As a result, the board of that corporation has undertaken a review of its overheads and its operations and has responded by proposing a reduction in the size of the board from nine to seven. The purpose of this particular amendment is to reduce the number of `other members' on the corporation from six to four to give effect to that situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I spoke yesterday in this chamber about the wine industry and the strategy vision it had developed to expand its exports over the next three decades. Of course, the horticultural industries, the exporting thrust of which the Australian Horticultural Corporation oversees, is an industry that shows enormous potential for export.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much has been said in this House and elsewhere about the burgeoning demand for perishable food exports to Asia and the opportunities which exist for Australian horticultural produce in these growing markets. The activities of the corporation is central to and very important in improving the export performance of this industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, we all know that it is not just a matter of promotion of products in these particular export markets. Australia has a lot more work to do in expanding its productive base and getting the produce that is grown in this range of industries into the export markets on time and of sufficient quality to demand a premium price. Our Achilles heel at the moment is the freight task, particularly airfreight. I just mention, Mr Deputy Speaker, that I was in Tasmania only last Saturday speaking to horticultural producers about the opportunities that exist for the export of produce from your state and other areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I raised with them a particular proposal that is very important to the Geelong region, and that is the development of the Avalon Airport as a dedicated airfreight facility for the export of perishable products, including horticultural products to Asia that I have just mentioned. Avalon Airport, as you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, is a former military airfield that the government has recently leased to Foxerco, a joint venture between the trucking magnate Lindsay Fox and Serco.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The airport lies at the juxtaposition of several major transport assets in the region&mdash;the Princes Highway, the national standard gauge and the port of Geelong. There are very few places on the face of the earth that have this juxtaposition of such transport assets offering 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4515"> the opportunity for large scale airfreighting of horticultural and other produce out of Australia into these burgeoning markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a push in the Geelong area, and elsewhere, for this facility to become a dedicated airfreight facility for the export of horticultural and other products. We seem to be getting somewhere in that task. The company which now leases the airport has committed $2&half; million to materials handling equipment to handle horticultural and other produce. We expect the facility to be able to handle airfreight out of there in the not too distant future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To supply a significant operation one needs a very productive hinterland. That whole proposal is based on drawing produce not only from the state of Tasmania but from Victoria, the Riverina area and South Australia. I mention this proposal because if this dedicated airfreight facility for the export of horticultural products, and other floricultural and aquaculture products, were to get under way the generation of export income and employment would be quite enormous. I guess in the midst of that will be the Australian Horticultural Corporation&mdash;trimmed down, in line with the demands of industry&mdash;promoting exports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another particular amendment in this legislation relates to the Export Control Act 1982. The proposed amendments to section 23 of the act will extend the export certification arrangements that currently exist between AQIS and registered export establishments for Australia's fish and dairy industries to meat export establishments. We have seen rather substantial developments in information technology over the past decade, and accompanying that have been rapid advances in electronic transmission systems. The amendments being proposed will enable registered processing establishments, brokers, exporters, cold store operators and on&hyphen;site AQIS officers to facilitate the issuance of export permits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is part of that streamlining of the bureaucratic task that accompanies our export effort. Of course, we need to regulate this area but we have to, as a government, determine that we will keep pace with developments that are occurring in information technology in our electronic transfer system. That particular amendment gives effect to that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments to the Farm Household Support Act 1992 and the Social Security Act 1991 provide mechanisms for overpayments of drought relief payments to be recovered. The Farm Household Support Act provides for overpayments of drought relief payments to be recovered as a debt due to the Commonwealth but it does not particularly specify the means by which these debts may be recovered. These amendments will provide the mechanisms by which drought relief payment debts can be recovered. That will ensure that there is equity and uniformity with the recovery payments that exist in other areas of social security payments. Of course, the amendments to the Social Security Act 1991 mirror the provisions for overpayment recovery in respect of the Farm (Household Support) Act 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another particular act that is the subject of amendments under the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill that is before the House is the Imported Food Control Act 1992. The amendment that has been proposed for the Imported Food Control Act 1992 provides power to make exemptions from all of the provisions of the act for certain New Zealand food and that regulations specify the `food of a kind' to which exemption applies. This proposed amendment will not affect Australia's quarantine requirements. This particular amendment relates to the Trans-Tasman Mutual Recognition Bill, which was anticipated to have overriding provision in respect of the application of the Imported Food Control Act 1992 to food imported from New Zealand.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4516">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final matter that I wish to deal with in my introductory remarks relates to the Quarantine Act 1908. The amendments being proposed to the legislation are intended to clarify and confirm the legislative authority for quarantine policy shifts that reflect areas of heightened quarantine interest such as the discharge of waste water from vessels. These amendments are being proposed following a review of the quarantine proclamations and quarantine regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are all fairly non&hyphen;contentious amendments&mdash;if I can say that, Mr Deputy Speaker&mdash;being proposed to the Primary Industries and Energy Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997. The opposition does not intend to oppose the amendments that are being proposed by the government. My esteemed colleague the honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) will be taking up those particular amendments which relate to the resources and energy portfolio.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to have an opportunity to participate in this debate, and to follow my good friend and colleague the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) who, I must say, gave a very bipartisan summary of the state of this particular legislation. The member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) has said it is in his nature, and I am happy to pick that point up. I want to further expand on that by saying that it struck me as I sat here that I could in fact&mdash;it would be more convenient for Hansard if I could do this&mdash;ask the member for Corio for his speech and merely read it as my speech will only be reflecting the same sentiments as his. This has been quite a bipartisan approach. The member for Corio said at one stage, and I wrote it down, `We will have to, as a government . . . ' I thought that was obviously a freudian slip, which I can understand, but it was giving an even more bipartisan shine to the legislation before the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of what I am saying therefore, Mr Deputy Speaker, will be repetitious, although I must say that I had not had the privilege of being in your electorate last week, so I would have had to eliminate that part of the member for Corio's speech. I am, of course, happy to be in your electorate at any time, if only to help win for you those votes that the member for Corio may have lost you. Only time will tell.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="O'CONNOR" NAMEID="WU5">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WU5">Mr O'Connor</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is very unkind.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HE4">Mr ANDREW</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not at all, member for Corio. In fact, it could be reflecting on my own capacity to win votes for the Deputy Speaker. The legislation before the House, as the member for Corio has said, comprises a number of relatively minor changes to a range of acts. The first of those changes is to the Australian Horticultural Corporation Act 1987. As the member for Corio has already revealed to the House, the corporation is currently supported by the apple, pear, orange, nursery, fresh stone fruit, avocado, chestnut, macadamia and dried vine fruits industries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the corporation recognises that a number of those industries that are signatories to it are unhappy with the cost of its overheads. As a result, the corporation has taken the quite responsible decision to prune its activities, so that in future it will comprise the chair, a government member, the managing director and, in place of the six additional members, it will have four additional members, with the act being further amended to ensure that a quorum will be made up of four people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In many ways the corporation is mirroring what the government has been endeavouring to do&mdash;that is, cut overheads to the point at which only key performance people are left. I will acknowledge, in the spirit that was being echoed in this chamber earlier, that cutting overheads clearly means it is more difficult to immediately prune unemployment, because additional 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4517"> people are made unemployed. It hurts, but the government knows that if you are serious about unemployment, then you need a productive Australian base and you need people employed in productive industries. And what the government is about is fostering as many productive industries as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation before the House also deals with the Export Control Act and allows the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service to amend the way in which it goes about its quarantine inspection so that suitably qualified people can be authorised to undertake inspection on behalf of AQIS. What is happening&mdash;as you would be aware in your electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker, and as all members in the chamber currently would be aware&mdash;is that there is an increasing emphasis on exporters assuming more and more responsibility for the quality control of their products. Here we have a case where the minister is rightly saying, `Let's not reduce AQIS's control, but reduce AQIS's immediate involvement and so let our exporters take more responsibility.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was pleased to see this amendment, because I have had an experience over the last month with a major new exporter of horticultural product in my electorate who was being adversely affected and frustrated by the actions of AQIS. In the town of Renmark, the Almondco group have come together as a conglomerate of almond processors in a magnificent new factory, dominating the almond processing industry in South Australia. This is of particular significance both from an export point of view and an AQIS point of view in terms of this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For many years Australians have had to import almonds simply because Australian almond production did not match the consumption. There has now been a dramatic growth in irrigated almond orchards and a dramatic growth in the range of varieties available to growers. So we are now at the point where we not only have a viable Australian almond industry that, without any protection, has to meet competition from modern producers, such as those in California; but, furthermore, we have an almond industry with an eye to the export market. Almondco came to me because they saw export markets they could service. They were anxious to get into those markets. They had signed up contracts for those markets&mdash;and I will reveal that in a moment. Then they found themselves frustrated because of the way in which AQIS had demanded standards that were beyond the pale.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No&hyphen;one quibbles, of course, with the need for Australian export standards to be top quality; no&hyphen;one quibbles with the need for us to export nothing that puts our reputation at risk. But I know Almondco and I know their almond product. Theirs is the most modern factory in Australia and they are taking their almonds off huge, professionally run orchards. But they were being frustrated by AQIS's insistence that the i's be dotted and the t's be crossed, and they came to me to seek some relief.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is to the minister's credit that Almondco now have their approval and that the AQIS officers who were causing the frustration have been appropriately dealt with. The frustration was that Almondco were seeking, out of a 5,000 tonne crop valued at $40 million&mdash;and this is just one South Australian horticultural processor&mdash;to capture export opportunities which would take up to 3,500 tonnes of that crop, or an export potential of something like $28 million. It was something that the nation could not afford to lose and something that AQIS should have been facilitating, not frustrating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously AQIS had a job to do. No&hyphen;one, as I said earlier, would suggest otherwise. But their task was to see themselves as Australians developing an Australian export market in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4518"> cooperation with Almondco, not as public servants seeking to frustrate what Almondco were endeavouring to do. Let me illustrate that for just a moment. A letter from Almondco says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We were informed that they&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is AQIS&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">will also not sign off without an Import Licence Number for shipments to Iran, Korea, Japan and India, as almonds are prohibited goods for import in those countries without a licence.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Almondco manager says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was reluctant to contact our customers as it is a falling market at present and I did not wish to give them any reason to cancel their contracts with us. However, I did receive replies, by fax, from customers in Japan and Korea who informed us that Import Licence is not required.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have with me at present our new customer from India, who informed me verbally, and who will confirm by fax that Import Licensing for almonds was discontinued by India three or four years ago.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Also, I contacted some business associates in Melbourne and Sydney who informed me that AQIS inspectors will sign Phytosanitary Certificates in their states if the words `Not Sighted' are inserted in the Import Permit section of the Certificate.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This was just a further frustration that the company was facing on a matter of AQIS being unnecessarily pedantic, a matter that subsequently has been cleared up and is addressed by this legislation, as the minister points to the fact that it should be possible for responsible companies and responsible exporters to accept the consequences for maintaining their own standard quality control measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As has been emphasised by the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor), among those Australian primary industries most likely to help us address our balance of payments deficit, horticulture has to be prominent. What is most needed for horticulture to succeed is increased market access.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me illustrate what has happened in recent times with market access that will be facilitated by an AQIS body trying to develop export markets and by the Australian horticulture corporation recognising its lean and mean role in helping horticultural producers to develop these markets as well.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last few months the first deliveries of Australian potatoes and carrots entered South Korea. For the first time, Australian stone fruit has been exported to the Taiwanese market. Taiwan is phasing out discrimination against Australian beef quotas and has doubled Australia's apple quota, a situation that we hope is not frustrated by the recent speculation about fire blight. Australian fruit juice, milk powder, cheese and vegemite&mdash;that might be drawing rather a long horticultural bow&mdash;are on the shelves in Sri Lanka.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This additional market access is possible because of our adherence, as we all know, to the uncomfortable rules of the World Trade Organisation. Those who, in the present climate, have been pleading for tariff protection for any industries in Australia put at risk the market access we have gained for horticultural products and for a range of manufacturing products as a result of our adherence to the WTO. I cannot sufficiently stress, politically uncomfortable as it is, the importance to Australia's export performance of a lean and mean AHC, of better AQIS standards, and of our adherence to the regulations that we are forced to abide under the World Trade Organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Basically, uncomfortable as it is, the bottom line is that we only produce four per cent of the world's wheat production, three per cent of the world's cotton crop, four per cent of the world's sugar production, and 0.3 per cent of the world's rice production. We have no leverage 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4519"> in terms of overseas markets. The only leverage we can gain, we have gained through the WTO, and that has given increased market penetration for a range of horticultural products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me conclude on this note: as many of you are aware, prior to entering the parliament, and still today, I have an interest in the citrus industry. Much is made of the collapse of the citrus industry as a result of the import of Brazilian orange juice. Much too little is made of the success that the citrus industry is now enjoying in whole fruit in cartons: navel oranges are going to North America; lemons are going to Japan, and mandarins are finding their way into Asia as a result of our adherence to the world trade rules which have given us additional market access. The Americans endeavoured to frustrate that market access. They were taken to court under the World Trade Organisation rules and obliged to allow Australian navel producers in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bottom line remains. There is more for us to win than to lose under our WTO provisions. Adherence to WTO provisions, a leaner and meaner AHC, and greater flexibility in the way in which we go about our quarantine inspection&mdash;as recommended in the Nairn report and covered in this legislation&mdash;will spell a better future for Australian horticulture. I support the legislation before the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As indicated by the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor), I propose to make some remarks so far as the opposition is concerned in respect of schedules 5, 6 and 8 of the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997. Consistent with the tone introduced by the member for Corio and taken up by the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew), I am pleased to advise the committee and the honourable member for Wakefield that the opposition has no difficulty with any of the amendments proposed in schedules 5, 6 and 8. Of course, I deal with those in my capacity as shadow minister for resources and energy. My colleague, the member for Corio, dealt with the other schedules in his capacity as Parliamentary Secretary to the Leader of the Opposition and to the shadow minister for primary industries and energy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Very briefly, schedule 5 deals with the Moomba&hyphen;Sydney Pipeline System Sale Act of 1994. These are, without need for further ado, technical amendments to tidy up the sale of that pipeline. Schedules 6 and 8 deal with the amendments to the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967. The amendments to schedule 8 of the Sea Installations Act 1987 are consequential amendments upon those amendments to the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to make some remarks in respect of that schedule but, bearing in mind that we close at 1 o'clock, I will curtail my remarks at about 12.45 p.m. to enable the honourable member for Calare (Mr Andren) to make his contribution as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Schedule 6 deals with the submerged lands act. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) in his second reading speech when he introduced this bill, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This will facilitate projects such as the proposed gas pipeline from Papua New Guinea to north Queensland, and the proposed gas pipeline from the Timor Gap zone of cooperation to Darwin.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was a reference to the change which this amendment makes. It amends the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act so that it has the effect that petroleum pipelines in the Australian continental shelf that carry petroleum from a source outside Commonwealth waters will be covered by the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act and, as a consequence, by our petroleum regulatory regime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a sense, this is a technical oversight: it was not envisaged in the 1960s that we would bring gas to mainland Australia from outside of Commonwealth waters. Of course, it was 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4520"> envisaged that gas would be brought from offshore, as is done; but this enables Australia's petroleum pipeline regime under the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act to cover gas which emanates from outside of Commonwealth waters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his second reading speech, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy referred in very short terms to two pipelines: the proposed gas pipeline from Papua New Guinea to north Queensland, and the proposed pipeline from the Timor Gap zone of cooperation to Darwin. These are both very exciting prospects for Australia: for Queensland on the one hand, and for the Northern Territory on the other. It is worth making a few remarks about those.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The pipeline from Papua New Guinea to Queensland is proposed to draw natural gas by pipeline from the highlands of Papua New Guinea to the coast of Papua New Guinea and across the Torres Strait, and from Cape York down to Townsville or Gladstone. Why is this an important proposal or prospect? It is important because it further enhances both the prospect of bringing the cost of energy down and the prospect of downstream processing so far as our minerals and resources industries are concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is an element of chicken and egg here. If the pipeline goes to Gladstone, Comalco's alumina refinery at Gladstone may go ahead. If, on the other hand, Comalco's alumina refinery in Gladstone goes ahead, the pipeline proponents will have some confidence that the required volume of gas will warrant the capital expenditure! The prospect of cheaper gas is, of course, important for the Korea Zinc smelter in Townsville. So far as the alumina refinery in Gladstone is concerned, from a Queensland point of view, it is the case that bauxite will be shipped from Weipa to Gladstone for that purpose. This has the potential to create further downstream processing in Queensland. It will also bring the capacity for lateral pipelines to go into the centre of Queensland and further accelerate the competitive gas environment in Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had a spirit of bipartisanship here this morning, and so I will only make my next comment in passing. It is, of course, unfortunate that, in another area, so far as infrastructure borrowings are concerned, the government decision that was made in the Budget to exclude projects other than road and rail will, of course, have the effect that the Chevron proposal for a billion odd dollar pipeline project from Papua New Guinea to Gladstone will not fall for consideration so far as incentive for private investment in that project is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second reference that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy made in his speech was to the drawing of gas from the zone of cooperation to Darwin. This is, of course, a reference to drawing gas from the Bayu&hyphen;Undan gas field in the zone of cooperation to Darwin. It is the subject of a proposed or possible liquid natural gas project, drawing gas from that field. In the short time available to me, without impinging upon the time available to the member for Calare, I will make some brief comment about Australia's natural gas industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia's natural gas industry is, at the moment, entirely contained within the North West Shelf project of Western Australia. That is operated by Woodside and is a project of six joint venture partners. The project exports 7&half; million tonnes of liquefied natural gas to Japan each year&mdash;some 131 cargoes&mdash;and also has a capacity for about six or seven spot cargoes per year to different destinations. That is a substantial export earner for Australia and it is a project which, it is true to say, has had bipartisan support from this parliament since its conception in the 1970s and its inception in the 1980s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been contemplated by the joint venture partners to expand the capacity of that project to effectively double that capacity. At the same time there are two or three other possible liquefied natural gas projects, one of which relates to the Bayu-Undan field in the zone of cooperation which is, of course, the relevance of this amendment.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4521">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is the possible Wapet proposal in the Gorgon field which is to the south of the North West Shelf, the Griffin-Rankin field and the joint venture partners liquefied natural gas project at the Burrup Peninsula. The Wapet possibility is to have a liquefied natural gas project coming from the Gorgon field. The Gorgon field is in about 200 metres of water. There is an adjoining field called the Chrysaor field which is in deeper water, slightly to the north&hyphen;east. That project, if it gets up and running, has the potential to equal the current capacity of the North West Shelf venture itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently, Mr Deputy Speaker, you may have noticed an announcement by Woodside and Shell. Shell, of course, is one of those players who happens to be a joint venture partner and also a member of the Wapet consortium. The announcement was that Woodside and Shell would conduct a feasibility study on a liquefied natural gas plant going to the Northern Territory, drawing gas from fields slightly to the east of the zone of cooperation. That project has the same potential capacity as the North West Shelf joint venture partners project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Bayu-Undan project is under consideration by BHP Petroleum and Phillips, an American petroleum company. There is the prospect of drawing gas from the Bayu-Undan field in the zone of cooperation to a land based liquefied natural gas plant in Darwin or a possible offshore liquefied natural gas plant. That is the subject of some consideration between those consortium partners and it is no secret that there is some modest arguments between the partners about which is the best technology and which is the best location.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you add all those together there it is a lot of gas and a lot of potential. It will be interesting and exciting to see which of them come off. It may well be that some do not all come off, but I think there is a healthy potential for at least two big projects in addition to the North West Shelf.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Be that as it may, a very modest amendment contained in this Bill does carry with it very significant and further exciting prospects for Australia in the liquefied natural gas industry. There are further prospects of trebling&mdash;as the Gas Association's gas supply and demand study showed this week&mdash;our liquefied natural gas exports from 7&half; million tonnes to 21&hyphen;odd million tonnes in the course of the next 10 to 15 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an industry which, as I said earlier, on both sides of this parliament for many years there has been bipartisan support. That bipartisan support continues and it is reflected by a modest amendment which, in the fullness of time, may well see the prospect of a pipeline from Papua New Guinea to Gladstone and the great assistance that will bring, and a liquefied natural gas project from the Bayu-Undan field to Northern Australia.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) for tailoring his comments to enable me to make this contribution to the debate on the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997. The amendments contained in this bill to the Farm Household Support Act and Social Security Act provide a range of measures for recovery of drought relief overpayments. That is one set of amendments I particularly wish to speak on, along with the amendments to the Quarantine Act and Imported Food Control Act which provide the necessary powers to make exemptions for certain New Zealand food.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me address these amendments first in the context of the current debate over the importation of New Zealand apples. These amendments, quite rightly, ensure that the scope of the Quarantine Act, first drawn up in 1908, fully reflect matters of quarantine interest including introduction, establishment and spread of disease or pests affecting human beings, animals or plants.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4522">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is indeed ironic that here we are debating a bill that empowers the Director of Quarantine to apply conditions to the movement of imported goods from one area of Australia to another, where permission for importing can be revoked, where we are finetuning the definition of the goods, including mail, in which illegal material can be secreted into the country, and we are debating it a time when a huge question mark hangs over the manner in which fire blight has apparently eluded our quarantine system and entered Australia, to be discovered by New Zealand scientists in the Botanic Gardens in Melbourne and in Adelaide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The recent discovery of suspected fire blight infestations in Melbourne and Adelaide really stretches our trust of our Tasman neighbours. How was it that within a matter of days after AQIS issued a draft set of recommendations declining to allow New Zealand apples into the country because of the risk of infection to our product had not yet been ruled out, these two discoveries were made so coincidentally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like several other members in this House who have taken a keen interest in the issue, particularly the honourable members for Murray (Mrs Stone), Lyons (Mr Adams) and Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), I have listened closely to this debate and taken on board all the evidence, especially the expert evidence provided by scientists and producers brought to this country, in particular from the United States where fire blight has had such a devastating impact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I particularly remember attending one meeting of anxious fruit growers as Nashdale near Orange on the night President Clinton was here in Canberra, a meeting where one of the President's countrymen outlined to orange growers the devastating effect fire blight had on his orchard operations. The verdict on the New Zealand research from the experts at this meeting was highly sceptical, to say the least. The New Zealand scientists were wanting us to believe that something like 10,000 cells of the erwinia bacteria were needed to cause any spread of the disease, compared to the figure of as low as 10 cells in other scientific papers prepared as long ago as the 1930s and consistently backed up over the years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The New Zealand industry was quite understandably upset by the continuing refusal, at least in draft recommendations, to allow New Zealand apples into Australia. But that is New Zealand's problem, not ours. Something that is our problem is the Ovine Johnes disease that now infects about 150 properties throughout the Central Tablelands of New South Wales. There has been little denial of that. It came in most probably on the carpet sheep, the Tukidales, imported from New Zealand about 20 years ago. Our quarantine system let us down then. We must not allow that to happen again with fire blight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So how strange it was that the discovery of fire blight in Melbourne and Adelaide was by New Zealand scientists. They just happened upon two clusters of mainly cotoneasters in both gardens&mdash;same plant, same sort of infestation, both in Botanic Gardens, but in two separate cities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The New Zealand Agriculture Minister, Lockwood Smith, has apologised for the actions of the New Zealand scientists who took the clippings from the gardens for testing. He promised such a customs breach would not occur again. Well, the very same scientist, hardly chastened by this nudge&hyphen;nudge dressing&hyphen;down from his minister, has now come forward with data from a new study which&mdash;surprise, surprise&mdash;concludes that mature fruit trees do not transmit fire blight. New Zealand Hortsearch and its principal scientist, Chris Hale, who discovered the fire blight infected cotoneasters in Melbourne, say the study clears apples and pears of being a fire blight risk. He says it is a joint study with the US Department of Agriculture and that, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4523"> by accepting the report's conclusions, Australia could solve the woes of South Australian apple and pear growers whose fruit has been banned in other states. And those of Victorian growers too, I might add.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This sounds like some form of blackmail. The main chamber earlier this week heard the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) answer my question on this issue. He stressed that Australia is seeking expert guidance from German scientists in an attempt to find out the true strain. There is no confirmation yet, whatever New Zealand might want the world to think.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While only 15 to 20 per cent of Australia's annual crop is exported as fresh fruit, there is enormous potential for this figure to increase rapidly in coming years. The plans to export fresh produce out of Avalon and hopefully out of Parkes and other places, such as Cairns and Darwin, to South&hyphen;East Asia show the freshest and cleanest produce in the world is poised to take on the world. It would be in the interests of competitors to ensure that we cannot take advantage of the disease&hyphen;free status we now enjoy through a tough quarantine regime that has unfortunately been eroded in recent years at both federal and state level, but, thanks to this government's latest budget, will now receive a vital injection of funding to provide close to the sort of surveillance we need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How ironic that just as the infected cotoneasters were found in Melbourne, Australian producers were meeting Japanese authorities to discuss the export of fuji apples to Japan. Approval was likely in the coming few months but now the fireblight scare. What has been the cost of the exercise? Sales of Australian apples and pears have dropped dramatically. Apple and pear orders out of Victoria plummeted 40 per cent in 24 hours. Apart from fresh fruit exports, Australia is also one of the largest exporters of canned pears; 39 per cent of the market. So we can see the beginnings of the sort of devastation that this scare has created. Although the Japanese insist it is only until the current survey is completed, it is too late to allow the export of the new Tasmanian harvest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For apple growers around Australia this could not have come at a worse time. Growers in the Orange district have been struggling for years with successive seasons of crops damaged and destroyed by drought and hailstones. This year's crop is one of the best in recent times. The quality is first class, unfortunately the prices are at disastrous levels. Growers need to make $20 a case to make a reasonable profit and it is sitting at about $8 a case at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The irony of the amendments to the Export Control Act, Imported Food Act and Quarantine Act is dramatically underlined in the context of this fireblight debate. Here we are excluding food imported from New Zealand from the application of the act when our New Zealand neighbours are doing their level best to shaft our clean green image. Here we are easing trade restrictions by providing for new electronic data transfer. Here we are exempting certain foods imported from New Zealand to allow us to meet our obligations under the Trans&hyphen;Tasman Mutual Recognition Agreement, where food standards and food safety issues are considered equivalent, and here we have the New Zealanders attempting to argue that our apple and pear industries should also be regarded as equivalent. How? By us accepting that fireblight is common to both countries that is how. We are not going to fall for that. We have learned a lesson, I hope, from the ovine Johnes disease. We must fight every inch of the way to maintain and enhance our quarantine standards and not fall for the argument that a prerequisite for free trade is that the level playing field will be infected with every disease under the sun.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was going to say something on the Social Security Amendment Act but I notice that the member for Lyons is here. All I will say on that act, and I will point this out in my budget speech, I hope next week, is that there are farmers out there who desperately need the sort of flexibility that is in that legislation for people to have their situations regarded with some sympathy. There are many out there who are in the middle of another drought. They are out of exceptional circumstances but are now faced with up to 12&half; per cent interest on their overdrafts from the banks. They need very sympathetic treatment in relation to the flexibility in those amendments. I will leave it at that in the interests of letting the member for Lyons have a say. I certainly commend these amendments to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a few comments on this bill which contains amendments to a number of acts, including the Australian Horticulture Corporation Act, the Export Control Act, the Farm Household Act and the Imported Food Control Act, to name a few. I will restrict most of my comments to the Quarantine Act 1908. The amendments proposed are intended to clarify and confirm legislative authority for quarantine policy shifts that reflect areas of heightened quarantine interest. It is a pretty interesting time for that to come before the House. The sorts of things that the bill will cover include the discharge of ballast water, which is a big concern to us in Tasmania. Over the last few years quarantine has been reviewed by the body which is charged with implementing our quarantine regulations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also recognised within the Nairn report that to achieve the objects of quarantine in Australia, in the context of pressures from world trade, tourism and our international obligations, it is necessary to engage industry, government and the general public in a partnership approach to quarantine. It also recognised that it is vital that quarantine policies have account of the impact on the natural environment that some of those policy decisions may have. I can only say that in Tasmania we have had enormous problems with ballast water bringing in all sorts of unwanted pests. These pests have flourished in Tasmanian waters because there is little there that competes with them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Starfish are now in and around the port of Hobart, in plague proportions. It is becoming a local sport to see how many starfish you can pick up on the harbour bottom in a single dive. They are having a serious effect, requiring their numbers to be cleared every few months. These creatures are completely upsetting the ecology of the harbour and are spreading very rapidly. The whole bottom of the harbour at some times is covered by these starfish. Algal blooms occur from time to time in parts of Tasmanian waters and can also be attributed to the release of ballast water.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another interesting point that came out of the review is the imbalance between animal and plant sectors with respect to quarantine. The executive summary says that the examinations of incursions into Australia over the last 25 years reveal that the rate of incursions of plant pests and diseases was about 10 times more than that for animals. The review has sought a higher status for the plant industries, and rightfully so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are also queries about the way risk analysis is conducted, and a suggestion that there is a lack of confidence in the process. Of course there is. There is a real lack of confidence in the process and it is becoming more and more so. Still, Australia has been able to remain relatively free of many of the major pests and diseases of animals and plants, despite much more mobility of the population and an increase in trade. But there are other problems related to our quarantine regulations and international trade that have surfaced.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was with great concern and worry that I heard of the first appearance of fireblight on the various plants in the botanical gardens in Melbourne. I believe the cotoneaster that was mentioned is of great concern to Tasmanian apple and pear growers. To add insult to injury, this professor who was holidaying from New Zealand just happened to be a scientist&mdash;of course&mdash;who was able to come and pop into the botanical gardens. He was evidently on a holiday for 2&half; days. I always find those things a little difficult to accept on face value. I would like to know who paid for that holiday and if he does this on a regular basis, just dropping into other countries for 2&half;&hyphen;day holidays. His just going into the botanical gardens at that time and finding evidence is difficult for me to accept, along with other things that have come to light post that. The evidence was not assessed here; it was assessed back in New Zealand. It certainly left our boffins rather upset that no&hyphen;one had approached them and that people had the hide then to do the same thing in Adelaide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What these people are doing, basically, is trying to prove a point and say that we have had this disease in this country. What they are doing is a pretty shabby way of acting. There is consultation; we are in mutual trade relations. I just put this down to be a terrible experience and I think New Zealand should be very ashamed of this exercise. New Zealand should also be seeking, and is seeking, to export to Asia, and should not be trying to interfere with our domestic market. Yet it is trying to have a dig at us all the way down the track. I do not think this is doing the relationship between our two countries any good at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is certainly going to cost us money, particularly in my industry in Tasmania, where we developed the fuji apple. It has been developed for the demand in the Japanese market. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> yesterday had an article which to me was very timely, saying that the new apple was to generate exports up to about 10,000 tonnes within a decade. Now the Japanese officials are hedging. They are saying that they need more information about the origins of the disease that has been found. They acknowledge that there are no links between Victoria and Tasmania, but they want a survey. So they are starting to survey. It is holding up our apples and it is holding up our opportunities. I find that very concerning, because it was all started by another country that is in competition with us on the Japanese market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was speaking only recently to the executive officer of the apple and pear growers in Tasmania, who was briefing me on the enormous amount of effort and dedication that has been put into seeking Asian markets for these specially grown apples. The growers and the exporters are out there doing what they can in putting this together, but then they are having these sorts of issues dropped onto them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There needs to be a stronger response. I was very disappointed with the minister's response. I thought he should have been much stronger in what he was saying, when this is another blow to our markets. I believe that we are not to the bottom of this issue yet. I think there is a lot more to be said and a lot more to be done about it.</PARA>
