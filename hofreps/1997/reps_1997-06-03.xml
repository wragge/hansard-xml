<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Mr GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Prime Minister. How can the Prime Minister continue to assert that there is economic merit in the centrepiece of his budget, the 15 per cent savings rebate, when the government's most senior economic adviser, Treasury Secretary Ted Evans, conceded yesterday in Senate estimates hearings these two things: first, that the recent OECD report, arguing that tax incentives overall did not increase household savings, `could well have been written by Treasury'; and, second, that the net impact of the savings rebate on Australian savings was likely to be negative, with the $2 billion cost to revenue likely to exceed any increase in saving by individuals?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="4657" SPEAKER="Howard, John, MP" NAMEID="ZD4" ELECTORATE="Bennelong" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Prime Minister" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The savings rebate is a direct reward to thrifty Australians. As far as the government is concerned, rewarding thrifty Australians is a very desirable economic objective. It is a very desirable social objective. It is always desirable to provide people with incentives to save. It is always desirable to reward thrifty behaviour. It is always desirable to encourage people into good saving habits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I am proud about with this incentive is that it will encourage people to save, it will reward the thrifty and, for the first time, it will represent a demonstration of faith by a government in Australia in the use of the taxation system to encourage thrifty conduct. Far from the government being in any way in doubt about the proposal, we think it is an excellent proposal. It has been very warmly received in the Australian community.</PARA></ANSWER>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FT4">Mr BRADFORD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. At the time of the last election the coalition promised a national strategy to address violence and crime in our communities. Can the Prime Minister inform the House of actions being taken to address violence and crime in Australia?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="4657" SPEAKER="Howard, John, MP" NAMEID="ZD4" ELECTORATE="Bennelong" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Prime Minister" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very happy to inform the House that, on Thursday of this week, I will launch the national campaign against violence and crime in Australia. The launch of this $13 million, three&hyphen;year campaign marks the fulfilment of another major government election commitment. I am very proud to say that this commitment will be honoured, as is the practice of this government, in full.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We made a commitment in the last election campaign to undertake an active strategic role in association with the state governments of Australia, which have primary but not exclusive responsibility for matters relating to crime and violence, in addressing crime and violence in our communities. The campaign is the most comprehensive strategic national approach ever undertaken to not only fight crime and violence but also work on the genesis of criminal activity&mdash;the motivation and social determining factors behind crime and violence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first phase of the campaign will target crime prevention, fear of crime in the community, residential burglary, domestic violence prevention, early intervention, homeless youth, and preventing crime and violence at public events. This is being done in a number of ways and with cooperation between the Commonwealth and the states and territories. I want to particularly thank the Attorney-General of South Australia, Trevor Griffin, for the very constructive role that he has played in the development of these strategies.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4658">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Particular programs will be funded to target these sorts of problems. For example, to make sure that the best possible practices are being used in crime prevention, the campaign is funding the national anti-crime strategy to set world best practices in the ACT and in Victoria and to produce an effective model for crime prevention for use in each state and territory. In preventing violence and crime at public events, Queensland and New South Wales will assist in testing and evaluating the best practices available, and then we can produce a model for use across the nation. Those programs will be carefully monitored to ensure that results are achieved in the wider community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the first time we will have the means to undertake, test and monitor crime and violence programs and then quickly and effectively spread that program throughout the nation to address crime and violence at its sources. This is the first phase of the program. Over the next three years, different aspects of crime and violence will be targeted and specific programs in our communities will be expanded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I take the opportunity of informing the House that later in the year the government will be giving full force and effect to the commitments that it made in the area of domestic violence. I would not want the emphasis that will be placed on the campaign against violence and crime generally and the announcements I make on Thursday to be seen as in any way exhausting or, indeed, giving effect to the particular commitments we made in relation to domestic violence. A commitment to a national approach and a national responsibility in that area is very high on the list of priorities of the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Domestic violence is utterly unacceptable to all sections of the Australian community. There is a role for the national government in cooperation with the states and in cooperation with voluntary organisations. Quite separately from the campaign on Thursday, we will be announcing a number of valuable initiatives in the area of domestic violence.</PARA>

She did that at the commencement of the committee hearings, which is appropriate, well in advance of the Senate committee's consideration of the relevant part of the budget papers.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Treasurer. Treasurer, are you aware of comments that your new savings plan will&mdash;and I quote&mdash;`provide benefits to those that either do not need it or do not deserve it'?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Eden&hyphen;Monaro for his question. He
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4659"> reminds me of a significant difference between the Australian Labor Party and the coalition government&mdash;that is, the coalition government wants to reduce taxes on savings and the Labor Party does not. The Labor Party wants higher taxes on savings than this government is going to introduce as a result of its budget measure. The Labor Party should be going to every self-funded retiree in Australia and saying right up front, `We believe you should be paying higher taxes on your saving.' That is their position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had Senator Sherry, the person who really calls the shots on economic policy for the Labor Party, slinking around in the Senate estimates yesterday trying to do his best to undermine the savings rebate. They send the junior spokesman in here today, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the person who had to get rid of the member for Werriwa because he was embarrassing him when the member for Werriwa was the Assistant Treasurer, to get up here and try to attack the savings rebate. On Sunday, he went on national television and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I'm talking about the abandonment of the superannuation co-contribution, in favour of a little windfall tax break for those who don't need or deserve it.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Every self-funded retiree in Australia today should know this: the Labor Party believes you do not deserve tax breaks on your savings. Every pensioner who saves should know this today: you do not need and you do not deserve a tax break.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The BT statistical analysis, the research on this, said that, for those who were in the taxable income bracket of $5,400 to $10,000, 21 per cent of the benefit would go to them; for whose who were in the tax bracket between $10,000 and $20,000, 29.5 per cent of the benefit would go to them. So, 50 per cent of the benefit would go to people earning under $20,000, and the Labor Party says to them, wait for it, `You don't need it and you don't deserve it.' Under $20,000, it would be 50 per cent of the benefit and the Labor Party says, `You don't need it and you don't deserve it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Who did the Labor Party think deserved tax breaks with the l-a-w tax cuts? Let me remind
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the House, if you had a $200,000 income, an l-a-w tax cut was going to give you $1,252 per annum. Those earning under $20,000, those the Labor Party thinks does not need or deserve tax breaks, under the l-a-w were going to get zero. Zero! Why? The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has told us why. The Labor Party thought they did not need it or did not deserve it. At least you could say with the l&hyphen;a&hyphen;w tax cuts they practised what they preached. If you were under $20,000, you did not need or deserve anything and the Labor Party gave you nothing. Now they stand up here and pretend that they are interested in equity.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Leader of the Opposition says, `Forget our l-a-w tax cuts, forget the tax cuts that were put into l-a-w by the Keating Labor party. Just remember this, if we'd only been in office for 14, 15 or 16 years, we would have got around to a co-contribution.' What was the co-contribution? The co-contribution was a tax increase. That is what it was.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you were on average weekly earnings, a three per cent compulsory contribution was a tax increase of $20 per week. The Labor Party plan was to take $20 per week out of your after tax income. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, and you will have to speak to him because he does have a penchant for actually saying revealing things, when asked about the co-contribution at the National Press Club, said&mdash;and listen to this:</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Too right they were. Once it was explained to them that it was $20 out of their after tax income, you saw a huge falling away from the trade union movement. You saw an avalanche falling away from the trade union movement. A wonderful saving system this was! `Give us $20 from your after tax income. We're from the government. We will give it back in the year 2045.' Then they produced these figures which were premised on somebody going into the work force in the year 2005 and being on average weekly earnings for 40 years thereafter, getting their money back in the year 2045. If you could not deliver l&hyphen;a&hyphen;w tax cuts before and after the 1993 election, who would have trusted you for 2045?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That scheme was never introduced because it would never have worked. That scheme was never introduced because what it was was a tax rise. The scheme that was introduced was universal, was fair, was targeted, and they are the people who deserve it and need it, and the self&hyphen;funded retirees are the people that are being supported by this government.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK></QWN>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question seeks another impeccable answer from the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer inform the House of recent investigations into the cash economy in Australia? What do these investigations reveal about: the size of the cash economy; measures required to deal with the cash economy; and how these measures would relate in any reform of Australia's tax system?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="4661" SPEAKER="Costello, Peter, MP" NAMEID="CT4" ELECTORATE="Higgins" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Treasurer" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CT4">Mr COSTELLO</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Indi for his question and I thank him for his agreement with the Speaker about the Speaker's observations. In November 1996, the Commissioner of Taxation established a cash economy task force in light of perceptions in the community that non-compliance with taxation laws through the cash economy was escalating. Left unchallenged, these perceptions could undermine confidence in the integrity and the equity of the Australian taxation system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report states that there is no official or reliable estimate of the size of the Australian cash economy or the revenue forgone. Academic studies estimate the cash economy at between 3.5 per cent and 13.4 per cent of GDP. Using 1995&hyphen;96 figures as a base and an effective average tax rate of 23 per cent, these
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> studies suggest the annual amount of income tax revenue forgone could be between $3.9 billion and $5.1 billion. The report identified a number of structural influences on attitudes towards the tax economy, including the lack of an audit trail, taxpayers complaining that there were few incentives for them to do the right thing by declaring cash payments, and a growing perception that the rewards to be gained from engaging in the cash economy outweighed the risks of getting caught.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true that there is no tax system that is foolproof against tax avoidance and the cash economy; however, where the indirect tax base is broad tax is harder to avoid. Particularly with multi-stage, value added type taxes, it is harder to avoid completely. That is because if you drop out at the end of the process, tax has already been collected on the way through. What is more, there is an incentive to come back in at the end of the production process to receive rebates on those stages where there has already been a tax liability. A multi-stage, value added type arrangement on a broad base is certainly a measure which protects against the cash economy and which gives incentives to bring that into the tax net.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you see the level of the cash economy in Australia, it is unquestioned that no government could leave the level of that cash economy unchallenged. As the Australian Taxation Office indicated, to do so would be to undermine confidence in the integrity and equity of the Australian tax system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me assure the House that this government will put in place measures under current arrangements to encourage those transactions which are currently escaping the tax net to be picked up. We will carefully examine other options to ensure that our tax system is a system that makes the cash economy and avoidance of that nature much harder to engage in in the future.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. There was a strong rise in total dwelling building approvals in April of 3.6 per cent compared with March. This reflected a large rise in approvals for private sector houses. Private sector housing approvals jumped 11 per cent in seasonally adjusted terms, the largest monthly increase since July 1996. In trend terms, private building approvals have now increased for 16 consecutive months to be around 18.5 per cent above the trough of December 1995.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Cook for his question. I have seen these reports of a campaign being run by the TWU, which has been in part directed to the Reserve Bank in respect of the advice and the views that the Reserve Bank have expressed in respect of wages policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The brief history of this is that the TWU had a claim in the commission just a few weeks ago which was soundly rejected by the commission. It was quite an important decision because, when you look at the operation of the old centralised industrial relations system, what too often happened is that a few big employers would do a deal with a few big unions, and they would then take the deal to the Industrial Relations Commission to have it endorsed and to foist it onto all the small business operators. It is particularly important in the transport industry, because in this particular deal for many of the smaller transport operators there were no productivity offsets or trade&hyphen;offs. What it meant for regional Australia was simply another jack&hyphen;up or hike&hyphen;up in their costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was a very good decision for the Industrial Relations Commission, picking up the spirit of the new Workplace Relations Act to reject that decision and to say to the parties that, over and above the safety net, the system requires people to sit down and do deals which are relevant to particular enterprises. It is no surprise that the TWU are very unhappy that their past practices have now been blocked by this decision of the commission. But it is also a fact that the beneficiaries of this are the Australian community across the board and, in particular, anybody associated with the transport industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the attitude of the TWU needs to be seen in light of the other big decision that we have had from the commission recently&mdash;that is, the decision on the safety net wage; the $10 living wage claim about which they recently brought down a decision. One of the important things about that decision is that the commission gave a decision which was
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> responsible in terms of the overall economic circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is particularly important about that, whether you are an employer or an employee, is that they handed down a decision which is consistent with getting inflation down. Quite frankly, that is in everybody's interests, as this country has long experienced inflation rates which have been too high. The people who suffer the most from that are not the people who are on high incomes who can afford the accountants to beat the problems of inflation; the people who suffer are the self-funded retirees, the pensioners, the low income workers and the people who would like to have a job but cannot get one because of the distorting effects of high inflation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The truth is that this reaction from the TWU is just a return to the past&mdash;a past which has given us relatively high inflation to our competitors and an economy which has not been performing at the better levels that it should. They want to revert to the past in terms of the policy that should be adopted&mdash;namely, a centralised system. Also, unfortunately, it is a return to the past of the sort of bullyboy tactics that we have seen from far too many unions in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point that needs to be made is that in this case&mdash;the TWU case&mdash;they actually had support from the ALP. My shadow opposite number was actually supporting the TWU in the TWU case and he was supporting the ACTU's case in the living wage case, in which the commission&mdash;the independent umpire, which you claim to support&mdash;said, `If we had given the ACTU claim which you supported, it would have led to higher inflation and lost job opportunities.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think there is a clear national responsibility on both the government and the opposition to reject these bully tactics from the TWU. The government certainly condemns their tactics. When the shadow minister was asked about this, he essentially gave an equivocal response. I call on the shadow minister and the Leader of the Opposition to make it quite clear that the federal Labor Party condemns these tactics of the TWU.</PARA>

The government takes very seriously the challenge we have to try to drive down non-tariff barriers, not just tariff barriers, throughout our region. We do that at several levels&mdash;for instance, at the multilateral level through the World Trade Organisation, encouraging the ongoing review of the Uruguay Round. We are actively building support now for a new round of negotiations.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, one of the fundamental issues is that in this country we cannot go out into the world and persuade others to reduce their non-tariff barriers if we ourselves are increasing our non-tariff barriers.

This was an interview which was about, among other things, the Labor Party's trade policy. Was it the same trade policy you pursued in government? Was it the same trade policy we are pursuing? No, not at all. This is another example of the Labor Party abandoning old policies which were really new and modern policies and taking on, let us face it, even older policies.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we all know why you are pursuing this so-called new industry trade policy. It is for exactly the same reason you are doing the same thing with tariffs: for votes. You spent 13 years in government pursuing an alternative policy, and so cheap are you that you have decided to abandon any semblance of sensible policy in this country in a grubby scramble for votes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only thing is, as the Prime Minister said, you have form in all of these areas and your real problem is that you are completely unbelievable. You have to go out and argue a case. It is not always popular to argue the

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4669"> government is very keen to see these sorts of exercises which offer so much to rural and regional Australians and allow for job opportunities in the regions to be given every chance of going ahead.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The petroleum company Chevron has signed a collaborative work agreement with Comalco to examine the feasibility of a new $4 billion alumina refinery at Gladstone, in the member's electorate, in Queensland. This refinery would be a major downstream processing development flowing from Chevron's proposal to build a pipeline from Papua New Guinea to Australia to supply gas to the industrial and domestic markets of Queensland. The pipeline would link Papua New Guinea's natural gas reserves to the burgeoning demand in North Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The refinery would provide a major part of the necessary base load demand required by Chevron if it is to proceed with the $2 billion pipeline that will bring gas from the north to link with the national grid at Gladstone via Townsville, creating a new era in industrial development in North Queensland. The proposed alumina refinery at Gladstone would offer the very real prospect of thousands of jobs, would mean a major boost to the regional, the state and the national economy and would mean flow-on effects to small businesses in the region of Gladstone and in the electorate of Hinkler, with massive growth potential for a local service industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed pipeline with its supply of competitively priced gas along the northern coastline will provide a major impetus for the development of downstream processing projects in and around Townsville and the electorate of Herbert as well. I know that the member for that seat is just as interested in this matter as the member for Hinkler. There is real potential for jobs and benefits, for example, through the connecting of two power stations to the gas linkages and also through the potential for the petrochemical industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is very pleased to recognise the importance of the project and the people of Papua New Guinea, of course, will benefit as well with hundreds of millions of dollars of construction, permanent jobs and a
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> $3 billion lift to the Papua New Guinea economy over the 30&hyphen;year life of the project. It requires a high degree of cooperation and facilitation at all levels. It will be a major priority for the government and, in particular, for the project facilitation branch in my department. My colleague the Minister for the Environment, Senator Hill, announced the need for a full environment impact statement for Chevron's proposal, a cooperative process involving the Commonwealth, Queensland and Papua New Guinea governments. This news is most welcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been another very useful development as well. At the close of the last sitting week, the Senate acted in the interests of the nation in implementing one of the government's long&hyphen;awaited resources policy by supporting government policy of ending export controls on all resource commodities, except uranium, removing such controls on coal, mineral sands, liquid petroleum and, pertinently, alumina. This represents the removal of a major hurdle to investment and jobs in Australia, a major hurdle put there by Labor and never removed by Labor. No doubt it was something they were going to do in the 14th or 15th year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The export controls were put there by Gough Whitlam way back in 1973. They were put there to give the government power to approve prices for resource commodities&mdash;a long forgotten objective&mdash;but left there by those opposite. It is useful to remind the House that, when travelling in Korea last year, my colleague the Minister for Resources and Energy, Senator Warwick Parer, was told by the former chief purchasing officer for an iron and steel company there that, if Australia had not had those controls in place, `We would be importing from Australia 70 or 80 per cent of our needs for our steel mills, rather than 50 per cent.' So if you want investment and jobs in rural and regional areas of Australia, it is the Liberal and the National parties that you come to, not to the Labor Party.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In regard to the question on franchising, for the entire period of the previous government, the Labor Party believed in an industry code of conduct. They set up the Franchising Code Council. They put some money towards it&mdash;in fact, they put $375,000 towards it in the last term of government. We in fact committed $648,000 in the first year of our government, with a commitment of another $152,000 next year. That is $800,000 over two years. Some taking funds away!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am interested that, finally, the Labor Party now seem to have changed their policy. That seems to be their policy now. They had a policy once; they now have a different policy. We gave a commitment to hold a committee of inquiry into this very important matter, covering a wide range: tenancy, franchising, the fuel area, and harsh and unconscionable conduct. It is a very wide&hyphen;ranging report and the government will be responding to that report. We recognise that the small business sector is a very important sector of the Australian economy. We, unlike the opposition, will not sell out the small business sector. They have had 13 years of pain.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This just shows the complete ignorance of the Leader of the Opposition. He likens green corps to the former government's LEAP program. It is clear that he has absolutely no idea about the nature of green corps, which is a quality training opportunity that is open to all young Australians, unemployed or not unemployed. It is for all young Australians who are committed to doing something in their lives to improve the Australian environment. Over the next three years there will be opportunities for some 3,500 young people to work on these quality environmental projects.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The great difference between the programs is that the green corps program mobilises the idealism and the commitment of young Australians to do something for their environment as opposed to the Labor Party's desire to shuffle young people yet again through its short&hyphen;term training schemes which lead nowhere. At the end of the green corps projects, all young participants are provided with $500, which will be a contribution to take them on to further education and training, building on the experience that they have learnt from during their participation in green corps.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last week in this place I raised with the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser) concerns that we had in respect of the approach being adopted by his government to small business. I did so because both he and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) were espousing that they were the only true party to represent the interests of this section of the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a sector that has been championed on many occasions. Indeed, the Prime Minister consistently&mdash;this is the only thing he is consistent on&mdash;in almost every answer to every question in this place refers in some way to small business. What the small business constituency wants is not platitudes. What the small business constituency wants is some real understanding of their needs and a reflection by the government of the day to meet those needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure you will recall, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, as I think you were in the chair during the MPI debate at that stage, that last week the Yellow Pages Small Business Index was released. It indicated that the confidence of proprietors in small business has reached its lowest level since August of 1993 and that more than 80 per cent of small businesses see the economy in recession or at a standstill. It was interesting to see that, of that 80 per cent of people in small business who thought the economy was going nowhere, they still wanted to see this government respond to their needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the very night that that survey was released, the minister went on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> and talked of the issues confronting small business. The presenter, Kerry O'Brien, put to him a question about confidence levels amongst the small business community. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . according to the people who have done this survey and their own reading of it, confidence levels are at their lowest for . . . four years.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The minister responded, `Well, Kerry, I'm very confident about small business.' He went on to say:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I'm confident that by mid&hyphen; to late year, this year, that we will see a substantial rebound in the confidence and sales levels for small business.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In that interview with Kerry O'Brien, he further said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If you look at some of the other surveys, they are all very positive. This survey is measuring the past. Small business, by its very nature, must look to the opportunities of the future.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Of course the presenter, Kerry O'Brien, interrupted and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I'm sorry. This is measuring the expectations for small business for the next 12 months. That's looking to the future . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Quite clearly, this is exactly what needs to happen. We need to look to the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issues affecting small business have been documented and have also been distorted. On the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> program of Tuesday, 27 May&mdash;the same night that the small business survey came out&mdash;an interview was conducted between Paul Lyneham and a number of spokespeople on behalf of small business. The first of these was Mr Rob Bastian, whom the Prime Minister likes to quote regularly. Mr Bastian, when asked about the government's best efforts, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think that most small firms really still regard the Government as a bit of a burden still.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Lyneham replied, `But this government promises so much to them,' to which Mr Bastian said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Absolutely. The Government's position on that is that their largess has not yet trickled down. I hope they're right, but the figures that you're looking at there unequivocally say that the sector doesn't feel that that's the case at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Further on, Mr Lyneham put to Dr Marsden, who had done the survey on behalf of the Yellow Pages Small Business Index:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . what are the big issues worrying small business?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It was interesting to listen to the list that was given. Dr Marsden replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Very simple, lack of work, lack of sales, cashflow, consumer confidence and competition from big business.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is quite interesting that those were the issues fronting small business, as outlined in the small business survey by Yellow Pages, because they lead so nicely into the report
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4678"> which was brought down by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology late last month. It was entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Finding a balance</EMPHASIS>  and dealt with fair trading in our country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting that, when you read&mdash;and it is not a pun because the chairman was Mr Reid, the honourable member for Bendigo&mdash;the findings of that inquiry, you find some very interesting comments. In fact, they refute just what the minister was saying today and they also refute what the Prime Minister has been talking about in the past in respect of small business. Mr Reid, who chaired an inquiry which brought down a unanimous report, with one small section that the member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) dissented on, was quoted in that unanimous report as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This report will come as a shock to many people who have not been following the Fair Trading inquiry closely over the past year. The alarming business conduct issues brought to light in the Fair Trading inquiry have prompted the Committee to make strong recommendations about the need for legislative action on the part of the Commonwealth to provide a viable trading environment for small business.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Minister, that was the very point that we asked you about in question time today&mdash;that is, having some legislative base for small business so that they had some confidence in you. It was not what you were talking about but a legislative base. Again, I quote the chairman, the member for Bendigo, who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In particular, the Committee is recommending that a Uniform Retail Tenancy Code be underpinned in the Trade Practices Act, that specific franchising legislation be enacted by the Commonwealth,&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">and I thought that was the question asked today&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and that part IVA of the Trade Practices Act be strengthened to outlaw unfair conduct.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Small business is not afraid of strong competition, and it is not asking to be protected from a tough trading environment. Small business simply wants a chance to survive. The Committee's recommendations would give small business that opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's recommendations are not about "protecting" small business; they are about setting some ground rules for what constitutes acceptable commercial conduct in Australia.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Evidence to the Fair Trading inquiry suggested that small business has been "pushed around" by powerful big businesses for too long and, in fact, many of the witnesses giving evidence to the inquiry had already "gone to the wall".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee believes that the strong action it is recommending in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Finding a balance</EMPHASIS>  is the main hope for the sustained success of small business in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This was a view supported by the member for Petrie (Ms Gambaro) in this place who said that small business tenants needed uniformity and security and `stand&hyphen;over tactics and codes of secrecy are not on'. Having the background of a very successful small business in Queensland, I think she would know what it is about. She is supporting what the committee had to say as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the time this report was released, many other people came out in support of it. I go no further than what people from the Motor Trades Association of Australia and the Pharmacy Guild of Australia said. For example, the MTAA executive director said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reforming Australia's fair trading laws will bring more significant employment benefits for small business than the Howard Government's planned blanket exemption from unfair dismissal laws.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">But for the present, our concerns are not so much about taxation or industrial arrangements. The concern is how you can get structural change and adjustment in the market which is about fairness . . . so we can grow employment.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was also reflected by Mr Stephen Greenwood from the Pharmacy Guild, who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Government's priority should be protecting fairness in the commercial dealings of small business.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Exactly, Minister. That is everything that has been said in this report. There were some people who were opposed to it, there is no doubt about that. Those who were opposed to it were, first, Treasury. Surprise, surprise! They are against it. In their submission to the inquiry, they `cautioned against'&mdash;that is a bit of code&mdash;changes to the Trade Practices Act prohibiting `harsh and oppressive conduct'. The minister is against it. He has already said previously that he is opposed to it. There was somebody else who was against it too, or at least expressed a view.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">He went on to be quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">They've stopped listening. They don't have an industry policy. They are putting representatives of big business on committees to investigate small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I've got to the position where I can no longer tell people the Liberal Party is the best option. We really don't know what we're doing.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was said by the former Vice&hyphen;President of the Liberal Party in the ACT. So what was Minister Prosser's position? This report on fair trading was tabled on Monday, 26 May. The Yellow Pages Small Business Index came out on Tuesday, 27 May. In a question that was put to the minister as to what their response would be, the minister said on behalf of the government:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we will respond in three months.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is the usual response because, under the standing orders, the government must respond in the House to committee reports in three months, and that was his response. On Wednesday, 28 May, the member for Bendigo, who was the chairman of the committee of inquiry, recorded the<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Small Business Show</EMPHASIS> .

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8I4">Mr MARTIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In other words, cut the committee off at the knees&mdash;cut his own people off at the knees&mdash;as a result of the fact that when you look through all of this, he is saying that you do not need any sort of legislative underpinning. But interestingly, his friend and colleague, who was the chairman of the committee, said just the opposite. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>  on 31 May, Mr Reid is quoted as saying that the committee:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . looked at the voluntary codes in the franchising industry&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">which is a position the minister supports&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and there was a recognition that the voluntary code did not appear to have worked.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>  report further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He said, "if it had been one isolated state or area it would not have weighed so heavily" but the requirement for legislation "was the overall view of the committee and reflected the evidence."</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It reflected the evidence, Minister. Here you are, the minister for small business, saying that you do not believe what this committee has done. You stand up here in question time and say, `We set it up.' You say, `I personally took an involvement in this. I set this committee of inquiry up so they could tell me what small business needs.' They have. They have come along and said, `What we want is protection from the big end of town.' They have said that they want codes underpinned by legislation. They have said that they want franchisees protected by a legislative base. This afternoon the minister stood up in this place and tried to say that that was not what it was about at all, that that was not what the report actually brought down. My friend and colleague the member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) certainly showed that that was the case. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4680">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of the day there is no doubt that this government has got to adopt the inquiry's recommendation and it must do it soon. Kim Beazley, the Leader of the Opposition, introduced a private member's bill to deal with unfair trading and conduct in the retail area. It is a part of what this committee recommended and should be adopted. We, as usual, on this side of the parliament have done the work for the government. The bill is drafted. It is sitting on the table of this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All it requires is for this minister to get a bit of guts behind him, to go to the cabinet room and to say to the Prime Minister, who supposedly is the champion of small business, `Look, Prime Minister, the Labor Party has done it again. Here is a bill that is going to look after them, that is going to protect their interests. Why don't we put it in? We'll say it's ours, but really we know it is the Labor Party's. We will put it in here.' This will do exactly what the fair trading committee recommended. It is exactly what the small business constituency wants. Minister, we would probably even say that you did a good job. Maybe that is going a bit far. But we might say to you, Minister, that if you did what is required by the small business constituency, we would probably go out and say, `He picked up our ideas. That's fine. He is not capable of coming up with a few himself, but at least he did the right thing.' We have done that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We on this side of the parliament have already released some small business policy principles. Two of those are completely relevant to this committee's inquiry: stamp out unfair trading and protect the small against the large. The Labor Party has thought about these issues. The minister will get up in here and use the same lines as the Treasurer (Mr Costello) uses and so on. But our bill was in the place in 1995 and did not proceed because the parliament was dissolved. We have reintroduced a private member's bill on two occasions in the name of the Leader of the Opposition, and it should be proceeded with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of the day, we on this side of the House are not afraid to say that the recommendations contained in this unanimous
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> report should be adopted and that legislative underpinning of codes should be put in place.

I am pleased that the shadow minister is starting to talk about policy, because I remind him about Labor's policy with regard to small business.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted that the shadow minister is now saying that their policy on small business is finally coming, after 14 years. It is a case of `One day we'll get it.' Now they are talking about policy and policy debate. The policy they now have is a flimsy one&hyphen;pager. That is their policy as opposed to the coalition's policy&mdash;a very comprehensive policy with regard to small business, a very important area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we are going to analyse and debate small business policy&mdash;that is what the matter of public importance is about&mdash;at least we
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4681"> recognise the absolute importance of small business to the Australian economy. Let's look at policy. Labor policy on 18 September 1985 was to whack small business with a capital gains tax. They then thought, in the Beddall report, that perhaps they went a bit too far and that they might try to modify it. Did they do that? No, they did not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our policy was to remove capital gains tax. That has been delivered. What is the Labor Party's policy? We do not know. Are they now going to turn around and reimpose capital gains tax on small business, or have they finally realised that the capital gains tax was a major disincentive to small business? Our capital gains tax provision was for complete rollover, $5 million every five years. More importantly, the capital gains tax provision that we have put in place is that a capital gains tax on retirement will allow small business to build up their business as a retirement nest egg. When they sell that small business each partner or each shareholder will be able to take $500,000 capital gains tax free. That is $1 million tax free on retirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the Labor Party's stance on that? Are they going to block that? Are they going to put a policy back in place to say, `We won't deliver on those things.' What is the Labor Party's policy on capital gains tax? Are the Labor Party going to recognise that the capital gains tax that they introduced on 18 September 1985 was a severe disincentive to small business?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at interest rates. I noted with interest that the member for Cunningham mentioned the Yellow Pages survey in passing. One of the indexes of the Yellow Pages report is that of cash flow and interest rates. More importantly, what happened to interest rates? Interest rates under the Labor Party went through the roof. In December 1995, the prime rate was 20.5 per cent, plus penalty loading. Most small businesses were paying 24 and 25 per cent for their money. It sent thousands of them to the wall. What did the Labor Party do? They sat by and did nothing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the Labor Party's policy on interest rates now? Did they do anything to try to get the budget and the economy under control? No. They did nothing. They just kept spend
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ing. They kept spending&mdash;borrowing money to fund their deficits. What happened? It put upward pressure on interest rates and inflation blew out. Did they care about small business? Not on your life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our policy is lower interest rates and lower inflation, and to get the budget under control. We are moving a $10.3 billion budget deficit&mdash;it will be a $12 billion turnaround&mdash;to a $1.6 billion budget surplus in our first term of government and next year we will repay $5 billion worth of Commonwealth debt on the way through. This is the first time in a decade the Commonwealth has not had to borrow to fund its budget deficit. What is the Labor Party's policy? We are debating policy. What is your policy on interest rates? To put them back up again? To run budget deficits? I hope not, because it is small businesses that pay the price.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the area of unfair dismissals and industrial relations reform. What is our policy? It is stated in our policy document and stated in the Bell report. Our policy is to remove the unfair dismissal provisions from small business&mdash;that burden which scared the living daylights out of small business, which prevented them from wanting to put people on. The stories of what had been happening to small business under the unfair dismissal laws are legendary. Our policy is to remove that burden.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the Labor Party's policy in the area of unfair dismissal provisions? To put them back on, to put back the Brereton unfair dismissal legislation. They want to land small business with unfair dismissal provisions. We propose to remove the unfair dismissal provisions. What did Labor do? They said, `We are going to whack it back to small business.' Where is your heart? After 13 years of pain, why on earth do you give small business what you are giving them?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shadow minister mentioned the Yellow Pages Small Business Index. One of the relevant measurements in the Yellow Pages Small Business Index is the thinking about federal government policies. The survey asked: do you believe their policies are supportive of small business or are working against small business? The percentage of
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4682"> people who felt the policies were working against small business, from May 1993 to February 1996 under a federal Labor government&mdash;the pain index of what Labor did to small business&mdash;was 60 per cent. It is right up under Labor; it is right down under us. There has been a vast improvement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting that the opposition is now keen to quote the Yellow Pages Small Business Index. One of their own, Ted Lindsay, described in November 1995&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Dead right, and a lot of your colleagues went because they ignored the calls of small business. Ted Lindsay described the Yellow Pages index as `fatally flawed' and `politically biased'. Labor Party member Ted Lindsay said, `We say on the record that this report has no integrity.' I wouldn't say that about those sorts of reports. I just point out that the pain index for small business under Labor was running at 60 per cent. There has been a vast improvement under the initiatives we have put forward, particularly for small business. I hope your colleague who follows me in the debate wants to debate the matter you put on the record; that is, small business policy&mdash;something we have got that you have not got.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the areas this government has already acted on. The provisional tax uplift factor under Labor was eight per cent. Under us it is six per cent. Savings to small business total $180 million. The initiatives we have put in place under our modern apprenticeship training recognise the importance of training, particularly to small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We made a commitment to no new taxes and no tax increases. What did Labor do in the taxes area? Labor increased sales tax massively&mdash;from 10 per cent to 12 per cent and from 20 per cent to 22 per cent in the general rate. They whacked up sales tax. They whacked up fuel excise. All of those input costs to small business are a severe burden.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have already mentioned the important initiatives we have taken in regard to the budget deficit. My colleague wanted to debate&mdash;he did not in any sensible way&mdash;our initiatives in the whole area of fair trading.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> We have a policy, and we are working towards it. We are committed to the small business sector. Labor do not have a policy. They have finally decided to find small business, to discover small business after 13 years. Then they talk about their 14th year&mdash;what they would have done had they been elected for another term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Liberal-National coalition is committed to reducing government imposts on small business.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can liken what has happened to the Labor Party to a particular action. One thing that stuck in my mind in regard to a statement of the Labor Party, particularly by one of their former leaders, was the J&hyphen;curve. I guess their policies are a bit like the J&hyphen;curve. Small business prospects are up here. They have been on the slide down during the whole 13 years of the Labor government. In 1993 we were on the bottom of the J&hyphen;curve. One hopes that the Labor Party have finally found the importance of small business and they would hope for an upturn.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party has done what can only be described as a U&hyphen;turn. Like most of their other policy areas, the policies that they had in government are not the policies that they have in opposition. Now it would seem that they have a different policy mix. It is very interesting that the Labor Party is now saying that there is a need for better policy in the franchising area particularly.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with great delight that I take part in this debate. I hope the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser) stays for my contribution because I will answer all the questions that he put forward in his speech. This government's commitment to the small business sector now faces its largest test. The time for rhetoric is over. The time for the minister's arrogance is over. This minister, who is bereft of ideas, now has someone else's ideas that form a plan for action&mdash;a blueprint for the Australian small business sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How the government responds to the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Finding a balance: toward fair trading in Australia</EMPHASIS> will be a watershed in policy development for Australian small business. The Howard government cannot hide behind its rhetoric. The government cannot hide behind this minister.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4684">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee went out and spoke to small businesses&mdash;real small businesses&mdash;right across Australia. The report contains small businesses wishes and their aspirations. It also helped them vent their frustration at being treated as second&hyphen;class citizens by this government. How has this minister responded so far? What has he done to date? The signs are not good.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On many of the crucial recommendations, the minister has already shown that he thinks he knows better&mdash;and that is why he is leaving the chamber, as usual&mdash;than those members of the committee who have spent nearly 12 months talking to small business. This minister cannot spend 12 minutes in the chamber. Let me remind this arrogant and out of touch minister that every single coalition member on the committee endorsed every recommendation of this report. It is not just small business that he is going to ignore but also members of his own party room. He does that at his own peril.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the recommendations concerning franchising, the minister has already rejected out of hand the key recommendation. The recommendation is for national franchising legislation. The minister is caught up in simplistic rhetoric about self&hyphen;regulation. There is no doubt that the advice of federal Treasury would be for self&hyphen;regulation. Many of the bureaucrats in the minister's own department would support this view&mdash;so would many franchisors, but not small business and certainly not franchisees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are those who always believe that self&hyphen;regulation is best, even though there is no evidence to support this point of view. Self-regulation is a bit like the flat earth society and economic rationalism. They are theories that have had their day. In evidence to the committee, officers of the federal Treasury supported the old line of self-regulation. When Treasury was asked to produce an example&mdash;just one example&mdash;of where self-regulation was working, they failed to identify even one. When pushed on the matter, they informed the committee that they would respond at a later date. Many months later we are still waiting for this shining example of how self-regulation is working.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous report of the same committee into small business&mdash;often called, due to the member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), the Beddall report&mdash;recommended franchising legislation in 1990. The absent minister for small business asked why we did not do that. Let me answer his question, even though he is not here. When I became minister for small business in the Hawke government, I listened to many of the same people now advising this minister. I accepted the point that we should give self-regulation a trial go. I established the Franchising Code Council with representatives from franchisors, franchisees and service providers. It was under the chairmanship of Robert Fitzgerald, a distinguished Australian, who now heads up the Australian Council of Social Service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, the time for self-regulation has passed. It has failed and, in particular, it has failed small business. Under this minister all we have had on behalf of franchisees is the collapse of the Franchising Council. Franchisees are now without any form of protection, even under the voluntary franchising code. The council collapsed in December 1996 and here we are in June 1997 still waiting for `Mr Inertia', the minister for small business, to take some action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We keep hearing rumours&mdash;and they are only rumours&mdash;that an announcement on franchising is imminent. However, I think we are in for more disappointment again. The rumours are that this minister is again looking for a quick fix. The rumours are that he is going to put the fox in charge of the chicken coop&mdash;that is, he is going to hand over administrative control of the franchising code to the Franchisors Association. The Franchisors Association is a good representative body, but it represents franchisors, certainly not franchisees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If these rumours prove to be correct, this minister would have let down his own backbench, his government and thousands of franchisees. Franchisees urgently need an independent arbitrator to protect them in the event of a dispute with their franchisors. Mr Deputy Speaker, as a member of the committee, you heard evidence to this effect right throughout those hearings.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4685">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister is often quoted as saying that the previous government took too long and failed to enact all the recommendations of the previous report into small business. I welcome this opportunity to respond to those allegations. This is based on the minister's theory that if you say something that is not true often enough, people will start to believe you. Nothing could be further from the truth. Every single recommendation of the previous report was acted upon. I was charged with the responsibility of presenting the whole of government approach to the parliament. We will see how this minister stacks up in less than three months time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister is fond of bragging about how his government has introduced capital gains tax rollover. This, of course, was a recommendation of the Beddall report, something the minister often quotes himself. But he often claims that we failed to respond to the recommendation as a government. This is demonstrably untrue. Let me set the record straight for honourable members, particularly those on the other side. The Hawke government responded to the recommendation on the capital gains tax rollover by the introduction of a 50 per cent exemption from taxation on the goodwill component on the sale of a small business. This was widely welcomed at the time by the small business community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what these claims by the minister for small business clearly indicate is that he is without ideas of his own. The centrepoint of his small business achievement to date is the capital gains tax rollover. This is an idea which did not originate from him or any other member of the coalition. He knows where the idea came from, of course, but he will not give any credit for it. All we hear from this minister&mdash;and we heard it again for 15 minutes today&mdash;is simplistic rhetoric, things like `Small business is the engine room of the economy', `Get the government off the back of small business,' and `Cut red tape'. All these things are true and they represent the feelings of small business. But the question is: what is this minister going to do for small business? The answer is nothing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This minister is going to be judged at the end of his term. At the end of the small
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> business minister's term will people say, `Thanks to Geoff Prosser, we are better off'? Of course, the answer to that question will be no.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many issues that affect small business. The crucial issue is one of size. Small business is expected to compete with large business as if they are of equal economic weight. This, of course, is an absolute nonsense. The recommendations relating to changes to part IVA of the Trade Practices Act are extremely sensible recommendations. The most crucial thing for small business is how it interacts with big business. In many ways small business can be likened to the consumer. Under Australian law, however, consumers have more rights to protection from small business than small business has from protecting them from big business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In less than three months time, the minister for small business will respond to the fair trading inquiry. The one area where small business will judge this government more than any other is in relation to its response to the recommendations in this report, in particular, how it responds to the recommendations relating to unfair conduct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We hear a lot from this government about unfair dismissal. Let me put them on notice. They will be hearing a lot from this opposition about unfair conduct. The committee received overwhelming evidence that there was systematic unfair conduct undertaken by many large businesses in Australia against small business. The recommendations to change the Trade Practices Act are difficult to undertake and will take political courage. Many business organisations which have both large and small businesses as members will be found wanting in their support for any change.</PARA>

He is the only voice that small business has in the government. Unfortunately, with this minister, it is a very quiet voice.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to the minister for small business that there is no greater test than how he acts on behalf of small business in relation to fair trading. It has been a long process for this House committee. Under two governments it has brought down recommendations in relation to unfair trading. The Hawke government, to its credit, tried to tackle these issues&mdash;without overwhelming success, and I am the first to admit that. What this report now does is get the blueprint to the  next stage. It is a major test of the Howard government to see whether it can continue the reform process on behalf of small business.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am just telling you what you did say. I was listening. The fact is that the member for Rankin made a great play of the fact that he was going to reply to statements made by the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser), and then set forth on a speech that obviously someone had prepared for him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that small business was left in disarray by the previous Labor government. The group left on the other side is a result of the massacre that occurred in March 1996. There is no doubt that all those people who represent small business are on this two-thirds of the House. When we look at the members of the Labor Party that remain and we look past the union apparatchiks, we see that not very many are left. There is no doubt that a
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reaction is coming from the opposition as to why they lost the election and why they were decimated to such an extent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has gone through some of these points, and I apologise if I repeat some of them, but my memory serves me very well about the extremely high interest rates that occurred during the period of the Labor government, particularly during the recession that we had to have. Interest rates went through the roof. In many instances, as the minister said, they got as high as 22, 23 and 25 per cent. Small business, like farming, is charged penalty interest rates because they are seen as a risk area. Many of those businesses are still suffering today. They tried to stay in business by restructuring their debt, pushing it out a little further, but they are still paying the penalty from those interest rates that we had to have during that period of Labor Party management of the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we wanted to look very closely at it, it is very convenient now to forget the real reasons for the demise in the economy and the real reasons that there is such a struggle to get back to some base again. There is an old saying in the country that some of those opposite should listen to: one swallow does not make a summer. And 14 months certainly does not make a term of a government. There will be a turnaround in the economy and, if you look very closely, you will see it is starting to show already in the small business sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the election campaign the industrial relations area was hammered home to me by small businesses right across the board, especially in relation to the Brereton unfair dismissal laws. Opposition members have absolutely no idea how those laws absolutely terrorised small business. Given the legal system, it was cheaper for these people to just pay out rather than fight the system. They would pay out $3,000 or $4,000 that they did not have rather than go through a legal system that would cost them a lot more. It got to the stage where people would not employ, and I have to say that is still the case at present. Small business is still wary of two things: borrowing, because of the interest rates they were caught with during the 1980s;
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4687"> and employing people, because of the industrial relations laws that the Labor Party put in place. To this day that is having a very big effect on small business and confidence in small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has certainly tried to do something about that. The member for Rankin can talk about there being some moves by this government. Fine; I cannot complain about that. If he thought of it or if his committee had some idea of it, why wasn't it implemented? The coalition promised they would do something about this, and they have done it. They have looked at the red tape area. As anyone who has been in politics for any time at all would know, reports that come through to governments are not always accepted universally. Obviously the previous government did not adopt all the recommendations of the reports given to it. The government will look very closely, I am sure, at the report that has been put through and at those areas that can help small business. because there is no doubt, as the government has often said, it is a very important part of our system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Cunningham and the member for Rankin talked at length about unfair practices within business. I do not think there is anything new about that. I have been around small business for some time, and I recall very well the sweetheart deals&mdash;the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) referred to some of this today&mdash;that were done with big business and unions some years ago. I think that should be looked at very closely in the history of Australia&mdash;that is, some of the deals that were done between the now members of the Labor Party in this place when they were the heads of the ACTU and some of the big businesses in Australia. Don't kid yourselves that they were designed to help small business. They certainly were not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will of course always be healthy competition between these two areas, and the previous government embraced competition policy. They set up the legislation that was necessary to try to manage that competition policy. If there are unfair practices, there are places that people can go to. The member for Rankin says he is disappointed with the Australian Competition and Consumer Com
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> mission. Fine. That is the area that any complaint should go to. I would be the first to support any complaint along those lines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it is very interesting how people are able to adjust when systems change. I often remember what happened some years ago now with the centralisation of the baking area in Australia. I recall that in my area in particular many bakeries closed down overnight because of the economies of scale and the transport systems that were available whereby central baking could be done and compete at a very competitive price.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what has happened? In the intervening years hot bread shops have popped up. Niches develop within the system. I am pretty sure that, given a chance, we will find this with the competition between small business and big business at present. Yes, in the interim there is a problem because small business sees that big business is getting an advantage, but a niche market always pops up. Those people with entrepreneurial skills in small business will be into those markets and make sure that they develop them. That is an area that obviously small business will be keen to explore, and they certainly will.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just let me explore another area which I think is important, particularly in the areas that the member for Cowper (Mr Nehl), the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile), the member for Riverina (Mr Hicks) and I represent: the building industry, which is a very important part of the north coast area in particular. One of the big problems in that small business sector started in the apprenticeship system during the Whitlam era. The government of the day decided to pay full wages to apprentices. That was the start of the problems with the apprenticeship system in Australia, because they did not take into account the fact that business just could not carry that burden.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, following on from that we have certainly had some problems with the technology available and the fact that people have to go off on block release. But this government has done something about that for those small businesses. It has brought in the national apprenticeship scheme. It is looking at a training scheme. It is trying to overcome those problems and help small business,
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4688"> because these particular skilled labourers that have to be trained are obviously vital to that small business sector and the training is obviously vital to those young Australians. I am sure that is an important part of the whole system that this government is trying to address, a system which I believe the former government just ignored. It was in the too&hyphen;hard basket and they never really addressed that training system which is so vital in Australia to see that we have skilled labour.</PARA>

I seek leave of the House to make a short statement in connection with the minutes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leave granted.</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZT4">Mr SOMLYAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These Finance minutes represent the responses from various Commonwealth agencies to five recent reports from the JCPA. The first two Finance minutes relate to reports Nos 338 and 341, in which the committee made recommendations relating to the introduction of accrual reporting, accrual accounting and accrual budgeting in government agencies. Report 341 also recommended that the Commonwealth prepare whole of government financial reports and that legislation be enacted to establish a fiscal
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4691"> reporting framework binding on the Commonwealth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Finance minutes reveal that these reports have had a great impact. Many of the issues examined by the JCPA were taken up by the National Commission of Audit, the recommendations of which supported the JCPA's conclusions. In response, the government has committed itself to implementing an integrated, accrual based financial management framework incorporating accrual accounting, accrual budgeting and accrual based whole of government reporting. The government has also agreed that there is a need for legislation to establish a fiscal reporting framework, binding on the Commonwealth departments, hence the introduction of the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill 1996, which itself has been reviewed by the JCPA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's timetable for the implementation of the full accruals framework is broadly consistent with the JCPA's recommendations, and I welcome advice we have recently received from the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) that he intends to consult with parliament, through the JCPA, in relation to the development of the details of the framework. As the principal user of the financial and performance reports produced by the executive, it is appropriate that the parliament have considerable input into the development of the new accountability documentation required in the new accrual environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third Finance minute responds to the recommendations of JCPA report 342 into the administration of specific purpose payments, also known as SPPs. Most of the JCPA's recommendations highlight areas of better or best practice in SPP administration. They are important recommendations which should be considered by all agencies involved in SPP administration. I am pleased to note that the responses in this Finance minute are generally supportive of the JCPA's recommendations and most agencies have responded positively to most recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fourth Finance minute relates to JCPA report 344, which reviewed the reports of the Auditor&hyphen;General for the 1993&hyphen;94 and 1994&hyphen;95 financial years. The JCPA has a statutory responsibility to review all of the reports of
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Auditor&hyphen;General. This is a particularly important function of the JCPA. This Finance minute contains positive responses to the committee's recommendations, with the exception of the final recommendation, which has been rejected by the Department of Defence. The recommendation calls on the department to ensure that major procurement contracts contain provisions which enable the Auditor&hyphen;General to gain sufficient access to contractor records to allow the costs associated with quotes, claims and contract amendments to be verified.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This issue has been a matter of dispute between the JCPA and the Department of Defence for some time now, having had its origins in the JCPA's review of an audit report on the new submarine project. It has arisen again in the JCPA's current review of the JORN project. Defence's experience with the JORN prime contractor&mdash;which happens to be the Telstra Corporation&mdash;has done nothing to instil confidence in me that Defence's current procurement requirements are adequate to protect the Commonwealth's interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final minute is a partial response to JCPA report 345, an advisory report on the Income Tax Assessment Bill 1996 and related legislation. The committee is waiting with keen interest for the government's response to the policy recommendations in this report and in the second report in the series, report 348, on the Tax Law Improvement Bill 1996. I commend these Finance minutes to the House.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB2></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I stated when my speech was interrupted by the adjournment debate last night, I was very disappointed and disgusted that the government yesterday gagged the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) and myself from debating the car industry and the Senate resolution which supports Labor's car plan. As I mentioned yesterday evening in debate, a high&hyphen;powered delegation of community leaders from Geelong is in this House today, led by the Mayor of the City of Greater Geelong, Councillor Gerry Smith, to present the case of the Geelong community on the future of the car industry in the region. The city's submission basically endorses the central plank of Labor's car plan, which has been tabled in this House, that is, a proposal for a pause in tariff reductions at 15 per cent from the year 2000 to 2005.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once again, I urge the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on the floor of this House to meet with this delegation over the next couple of days so that he can hear first&hyphen;hand the concerns of a region that depends very much on the car industry for its economic survival. It is clear from question time yesterday that the Prime Minister does not have that understanding, and he must meet with the delegation over the next couple of days to hear the point of view of the Geelong community on what is a very critical issue to them.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is clear that the second Howard budget does nothing to create regional jobs. But the cruelest hoax of all in this budget is the government's savings initiative which the Treasurer (Mr Costello) touted so much in question time today. An ordinary worker in Geelong with $5,000 worth of savings&mdash;and there would not be too many low income workers in Geelong with that level of savings&mdash;will pocket a miserly 72c a week from Mr Costello's budget. To get the top $450 rebate, the worker would have to have saved in the region of $60,000, and I can assure honourable members opposite that in my community of Geelong there would not be too many workers who would have that level of savings. That is not all there is to the Treasurer's arrogant deceit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having promised Geelong workers that he would deliver on the $3.7 billion of tax cuts converted to superannuation contributions under Labor, he has broken that promise and, in the process, has drastically reduced Geelong workers' final superannuation payout. For example, a worker who is 35 years of age and earning about $695 per week would, under Labor's policy, retire at 65 on $280,000. However, without the matching personal contribution and co&hyphen;contribution from the federal government, the final benefit to the worker will be in the order of $170,000. That is a loss to a worker in Geelong of $110,000. So much for the Treasurer's concern for the battlers of Corio.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Working families in my electorate will also be badly affected by cuts to child care. Many working families in my electorate need their second income to survive in an economic sense and they really rely on quality child care at an affordable price. Last year the federal government cut $500 million off the child&hyphen;care budget and this year its budget cuts will amount to $321,000. These increases from 1 April have seen some working families pay $20 to $40 more for their child care in Geelong, and there is worse to come.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the area of education, Deakin University and its students have been badly affected by the cuts, not only in the 1996 budget, but in this budget as well. Deakin University, with the abolition of a further 4,700 undergraduate
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4693"> places, through the higher education Commonwealth industry places scheme, will be badly affected by this particular budget. Further, there are vocational education cuts of $70 million, 21,000 fewer university places&mdash;of course, the overall university funding cuts in 1996 were $400 million&mdash;and there is another one per cent lopped off in this particular budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very concerned about how this budget will affect pensioners and families. Many in Geelong will be badly hit by the Howard government's new drug tax. The government is destined to save $561 million over the next four years but, of course, that simply means that pensioners and families in Geelong will be paying more for their prescription fees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note also that the government has made cuts to the immigration and multicultural affairs budget, especially the grant&hyphen;in&hyphen;aid budget where the cut of $1.4 million may well impact on the Geelong migrant community and the Migrant Resources Centre in my electorate. Of course, the government has reduced money for the anti&hyphen;racism campaign. Application fees for new citizens in Geelong who have been signing up for Australian citizenship have gone up 50 per cent this year. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One thing you can guarantee in this debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1997&hyphen;98, in today's earlier debate on the matter of public importance and in last week's and yesterday's debate on this bill is that one characteristic will stick out&mdash;that is, the carp and the hypocrisy that all speakers on the other side consistently come up with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the 10th appropriation debate in which I have participated. My first speech in this place in 1988 was on that year's Appropriation Bill. All I can say to those opposite and, in particular, to the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) is that, if you take as a measure of response to a budget the number of complaints and inquiries coming into electorate offices, this particular budget has reaffirmed what thinking Australians would say about it&mdash;that is, it is a very sound budget. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact in my electorate office in the first 10 days after the budget was announced, we had about a dozen complaints&hyphen;cum&hyphen;inquiries and, of those, about 25 per cent were on funding for the ABC. So irrespective of what we hear from the other side, a lot of what is said is pure rhetoric. What I want to do in the very short time available to me this afternoon is to cover some of the facts rather than some of the fiction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think we need go any further to find some fiction than refer to the opposition's amendment to the motion moved by the Treasurer (Mr Costello). The opposition's amendment makes the point that this particular budget:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> continues the assault on families, the elderly and the needy;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> contains many mindless and counter&hyphen;productive cuts&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And it goes on. All of this is just rhetorical rubbish. What we really need to do in this place&mdash;and more importantly out there in electorate land&mdash;is deal with the facts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said before, I think this is a very sound budget. It is a `steady as she goes' budget. It has some very major initiatives, irrespective of what the previous speaker, the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor), said about savings. There are some important initiatives in terms of savings; small business; the heritage fund; the Federation Fund, about which I will have a little more to say; rural and regional Australia, about which I want to say a reasonable amount; aged care; child care; disabilities; and health care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Going back to the inquiries to my office, prior to the budget clearly there was a politically motivated campaign in terms of child care. I am sure my electorate office was not the only one where that sort of campaign was mounted. It was pretty clear that it was politically motivated. It was hypothetical in its approach, and I am sure it was some sort of national lobby being generated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The interesting thing is that, when the budget was finally brought down and the detail of the child-care initiatives emerged, a lot of what was being said amounted to almost nothing. People were coming to my electorate office particularly concerned about
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4694"> outside school hours care, but a lot of what they were saying was clearly ideologically driven rather than factually driven.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other lobby prior to the budget was a very responsible lobby, and that lobby was in terms of the disabled. In my area, we had a march by a number of people who were lobbying for increases in funds for the disabled, and I did receive a delegation into my office. As it turned out, there were very substantial initiatives in the budget in this area&mdash;whether it was in terms of the carers, the disabled themselves or residential assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think anybody should be concerned about that sort of responsible appeal to elected representatives like myself. But when it comes to the lobbying about child care, which was clearly politically motivated, I think we need to draw the line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been carping from the other side&mdash;whether it be from the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) in terms of job generation, whether it be from the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) in terms of industry policy or, in particular, whether it be from the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin)&mdash;the very aptly nicknamed `shadow minister for scaring'&mdash;in terms of social security, the aged and family services. I think she has been given an appropriate nickname. She really needs to deal with the facts rather than the fiction. I hope the honourable member for Hunter, when he stands after I sit, will address some of these issues with a little less rhetoric and a bit more factual acceptance of what is in the budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have only a very short time tonight to speak. I understand that members on this side may only speak for something like 10 or 12 minutes and, in the spirit of giving a lot of my colleagues the opportunity to speak to the budget papers, I just want to make some very brief comments in two areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first area is the linchpin for the whole budget and it goes to pages 2 and 3 of the Treasurer's statement and the budget speech he gave on 13 May, in which he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tonight I can report we have made very significant progress.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And tonight I announce measures to consolidate and extend that progress, measures which can secure our objective to put the Commonwealth budget into surplus in this our first term of Government. Our consolidated measures turned around a $10.3 billion Labor deficit in 1995&hyphen;96 and they lay out a path to a Coalition surplus in 1998&hyphen;99.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's active programme of privatisation&mdash;one third of the capital of Telstra&mdash;is not being done to balance the books. Aside from establishing the National Heritage Trust that money is going to retire debt.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think that is a point that needs to be brought home. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That money will free future Australians from debt and the debt servicing costs that threatened to choke them.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From the time we came to office to the year 2000&hyphen;01 the Commonwealth's net debt to GDP ratio will almost halve on current forecasts.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And then importantly he went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Speaker, for the second time in a row, I announce that this will be done with no increase in income tax rates, no increase in the company tax rate, no increase in the wholesale sales tax rate, no lift in the petrol excise. In fact, for the second Budget in a row, tonight I will announce tax reductions.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">If the member for Hunter wants to react to those, all well and good. We would welcome it. But they are facts, not mindless rhetoric.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of rural and regional Australia, which I represent, there are a wide range of issues relating to the National Heritage Trust. In my case, it involves the origins of the Murray&hyphen;Darling system and landcare initiatives. Moving on to economic development, it involves road expenditure of about $800 million. I want to thank Minister Sharp in particular for money allocated to the Oakey bypass, which has just commenced&mdash;and I drove the first pile in that project only a few weeks ago&mdash;the Westbrook bypass, which is well advanced, and the initial study into the Toowoomba bypass which, although not funded, could amount to something like $250 million around the turn of the century. At least we have a feasibility under way. There is the regional telecommunications infrastructure fund and more money in terms of business for quarantine inspection services. With

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the amendment put forward by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans), which serves so well to highlight the inadequacies of this budget. I do sympathise with the member for Groom (Mr Taylor). He is a decent fellow and a fellow for whom I have a great deal of respect. I sympathise that he and others on that side are struggling to fill their 20 minutes on this Appropriation Bill. They are struggling to find anything good to say about John Howard's second budget. I do sympathise because I would not like to be sitting on that side of the House attempting to defend the indefensible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is some advantage in speaking on this bill almost one month after the Treasurer (Mr Costello) brought down his second budget. That fact was brought home to me this morning when I picked up the newspapers and read that the government's most senior economic adviser had conceded in Senate estimates yesterday that the centrepiece of the government's budget, the savings rebate, may not increase national savings at all. When asked whether the initiative's $2 billion cost could exceed any increase in savings by individuals, the Secretary to the Treasury answered, `Yes, there is that risk.' Mr Evans also conceded the obvious; that is, that the full rebate will go to some who have not increased their savings at all. Indeed, more than likely it will go to many who, over the course of that financial year period, will actually decrease their level of savings. Among those are the people on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS> richest 200 list.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me assure you there will not be too many people in my electorate&mdash;and in the electorate of the member for Groom&mdash;who will benefit from John Howard's centrepiece
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> or from this farce which is the savings rebate. But there will be plenty in my electorate and plenty in the electorates of National Party members and Liberals representing regional seats who will be disadvantaged by the government's rebate. That is because the rebate is to be funded by ripping off some $3.7 billion in superannuation co&hyphen;contributions from ordinary working Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My advice to those on the other side is this: if you are looking for the savings rebate within the budget papers, you should look under `savings initiatives', not because this is a savings initiative but because this initiative is a saving to the government's budget bottom line. This is the scheme that saves the government billions of dollars in terms of its decision to renege on that superannuation co&hyphen;payment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) pointed out in his contribution to this debate, in the member for Bennelong, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), we have the Sheriff of Nottingham: a man taking $3.7 billion from working Australians and giving it to those capable of holding up to $60,000 in the bank and more. The Howard government's second budget can best be described as a fizzer. It does nothing for national savings, it does nothing for economic growth, it does nothing for business confidence and it does nothing for consumer confidence. It certainly fails to give the Australian community a reason for feeling relaxed and comfortable. But worst of all is the fact that it does nothing to address this country's most pressing economic and social problem: unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prior to last year's federal election, both the Prime Minister and the now Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, the member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), travelled the width and breadth of this nation, screaming blue murder about the rate of unemployment in this country. On the topic of youth unemployment, they were particularly vocal. I can still see the member for Goldstein on the 6 o'clock news every night bleating over and over again about the levels of youth unemployment in this nation. The fact is that there are now more unemployed
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4696"> young Australians in this country than there were when the member for Goldstein was on our television screens. That is an indisputable fact.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="SLIPPER" NAMEID="0V5">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We do not see him on the television too often these days. I know he is a bit concerned that he was given the junior ministry, and I suppose he is licking his wounds in that respect, but we do not see him on the 6 o'clock news any longer&mdash;not in the way we did before the election&mdash;because unemployment in this country is trending up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the Leader of the Opposition pointed out in his response to the budget, in Labor's last year in office, 176,000 new jobs were created. That was our contribution. In John Howard's first year in office, employment grew by just 89,000. In Labor's last year, male full&hyphen;time employment grew by 57,000. In the Prime Minister's first year, it fell by 12,600. In Labor's last year, long&hyphen;term unemployment fell by 45,000. In the Prime Minister's first year, it rose by 44,000. That is the legacy of the Prime Minister's first year in office. No wonder we no longer see the member for Goldstein on our television screens every night. In his early months in office, when unemployment was growing strongly, the Prime Minister told us all we should wait until he had been in government for 12 months before casting judgment on his performance on the unemployment front. That 12 months is now well and truly up; we are still waiting and 800,000 unemployed Australians are still waiting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What hope can we now hold for an improvement in the nation's unemployment rate as a result of this budget? What can we expect this year, following this budget and after seeing the results of a $1.8 billion cut to the former Labor government's labour market programs in last year's budget? What can we expect this year, after seeing so many jobs slashed by this Prime Minister in the public sector? Even on the government's own optimistic forecasts, GDP growth over the next 12 months will not be sufficient to bring the unemployment rate down in this country.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what is the Prime Minister's plan of attack on the unemployment front? As the member for Groom has just pointed out, he is going to set up a couple of slush funds&mdash;but, as none of them are funded over the next 12 months, they will have absolutely nil effect on unemployment in this country over the next 12 months&mdash;and he is going to spend $17 million on a work for the dole scheme. The member for Groom had the audacity to put forward that scheme as a solution to the unemployment problems in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not have a problem with the principles underpinning that scheme. There is nothing wrong with them. We had those programs under the former Labor government but, under those programs, we had certain protections for workers. We guaranteed them certain wage levels. More importantly, we gave them training, they were covered by compensation and they were guaranteed all the protections that ordinary Australian workers enjoy. Our schemes did involve some compulsion. The only difference was that we did not have the stupidity to put the populist title `work for the dole' in brackets after the legislation. Never have I seen a more blatant attempt to score cheap votes than that attempt. It is absolutely disgraceful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the 1997&hyphen;98 budget, the Howard government will spend almost $1 billion less on unemployment schemes than the former Labor government planned to spend in the same financial year. They want to tell us that their answer to the problem of unemployment in this nation is their measly work for the dole scheme&mdash;$17 million! Even at the rate the former Labor government was spending money, there were not enough places to go around, so how many places are going to be available under the work for the dole scheme for unemployed Australians? It is a farce.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his 30&hyphen;minute budget speech&mdash;his most important speech of the year&mdash;the Treasurer referred to unemployment&mdash;the most pressing social and economic problem facing this nation&mdash;on just four occasions. But it gets worse than that. On three of those occasions, he mentioned it in the context of the discredited work for the dole scheme. On the fourth occasion, it was to inform us that the govern
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4697"> ment did not believe that unemployment would get any better than eight per cent over the coming year. That was the fourth occasion on which the Treasurer mentioned the word `unemployed' or `unemployment'. What a disappointment. Such is the commitment of this government to the unemployed in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There does exist a very simple way to bring unemployment down in this country: create economic growth and get it above four per cent. But this government, despite the fact that other OECD nations are enjoying strong economic growth, is bringing this economy to a halt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me turn to another issue we used to hear a great deal about when the member for Bennelong was in opposition. I turn to the so-called gap between the rich and the poor, or the haves and the have&hyphen;nots. It is an issue economics editor for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> Ross Gittins found worthy of mention in an article of his in August 1996. He was commenting on the release of the Australian Statistician's study into the effects of government benefits and taxes on household incomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Gittins pointed out that whether the gap between the haves and the have&hyphen;nots narrows or gets greater depends basically on two things. The first is the distribution of private incomes. Obviously some households will enjoy greater private incomes than others. Some households will enjoy higher wages and salaries or other forms of income, such as returns on investment. That is fairly straightforward, of course.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing which significantly impacts upon the gap between the haves and the have&hyphen;nots is the government's budget. While the government has only a limited opportunity to influence the distribution of private incomes&mdash;it has less scope now that it has abdicated its role in wages policy&mdash;there certainly exists much scope for the government to influence the distribution of wealth in this country through the budgetary process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some interesting results came out of the Statistician's report into this area. He took the country's 6.6 million households and divided them into five groups based on gross income,
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that is, private income plus cash benefits from government. He then calculated each group's average private income and final income&mdash;final income being private income plus cash and non&hyphen;cash benefits less tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first thing his exercise found was that the distribution of private income is highly unequal. That will come as a surprise to no-one. The poorest 20 per cent of households had an average private income of just $13 per week, while the richest 20 per cent enjoyed $1,586 each week in private income. Thankfully, final income was much less unequal. The poorest 20 per cent received $233 per week, and the richest 20 per cent of families received $1,231 per week. So we can see that the budget process has an effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's budget can help to reduce the gap between the rich and the poor. But the question is this: what part of the budget process has the greatest impact on achieving a narrowing of that gap? It is easy to jump to conclusions and suggest that it is the progressive taxation system which has the greatest impact. But that is not true. While the income taxation system is progressive, its benefits are countered by the various regressive taxes and charges which exist at the state level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We must conclude that it is the spending side of the budget which makes the greatest contribution toward redistributing wealth. Indeed, the Statistician has estimated that government cash benefits reduce that gap by some 25 per cent. The explanation for that is that most government cash benefits are means tested these days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to turn to the most important result of the Statistician's study, which is that non&hyphen;cash benefits reduce the inequality by some 20 per cent. That is almost as much as cash benefits. Why? It is because they are not means tested and non&hyphen;cash benefits&mdash;which, according to the Statistician, are worth an average of $135 each week to all families right across the board&mdash;are worth much more to low income earners than to high income families; $135 means a lot more to a low income family than to a high income family. In the case of low income earners, it represents 74 per cent of their income compared
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4698"> with just five per cent for the top 20 per cent of households.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That brings me to my main point: what are non&hyphen;cash benefits? They are health, housing, welfare and child&hyphen;care infrastructure. They are all the things that the government once again has slashed in this budget. So where does that leave John Howard's battlers? I say it leaves them in very big trouble indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If anyone on the other side doubts the conclusions of what I have just said and seeks validity, they need only refer to a report commissioned by the Australian Council of Social Service titled the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Evaluation of the distributional impact of the 1996 budget on Australian households</EMPHASIS>. That study confirms what I have been saying: the reduction in services, particularly in rural and regional Australia, increases the inequality in this country&mdash;in other words, it widens the gap between the rich and the poor. If ACOSS undertake another study, into the 1997-98 Howard budget, I am sure they will find that the result is even worse. Why? Because the savings rebate will have an even greater impact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have the sheriff's cash grab of $3.7 billion from working Australians. Whom will that be going to? It will be going to those in this country who need it least. Again, this is a budget which adversely impacts on rural and regional Australia most. Once again I issue a plea to National Party members in this place to get in here and start sticking up for that natural constituency they purport to represent. They should come in here and defend their child-care centres, their CES and DSS offices and the aged and the unemployed in their communities. I commend the amendment of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I look at all those words, which have an equivalent meaning to hypocrisy, I am reminded of the contribution made not only by the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) but in particular by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans), who had the hide and the audacity to move an amendment to Appropriation Bill (No. 1), currently before the chamber. One would have thought that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was someone who was not part of the failed Keating government. He has the gall to suggest that this government wishes to do absolutely nothing with respect to jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Hunter spoke about unemployment, how important it is to solve that problem. This government aims to remedy the unemployment problem by creating real long-term jobs by growing the economy growing and getting it moving.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party gave Australia the highest unemployment rate since the Great Depression&mdash;11.2 per cent in December 1992. At no time since the Great Depression did the unemployment rate rise to 11 per cent and above until Labor came to power. Labor's recession that we `had to have' destroyed 310,000 jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sick and tired of hearing those opposite chant about the virtues of the failed Working Nation program. Working Nation churned the unemployed but offered them no real hope. The Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs evaluation of Working Nation revealed that the share of labour market assistance going to long-term unemployed people actually fell. It also went on to say that there was an eight per cent reduction in job referrals for the long-term unemployed. The evaluation concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This leaves the Job Compact open to charges of `recycling' clients from long term to short term
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4699"> unemployment, rather than substantially improving their labour market prospects.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That sums it all up, yet we see that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition seeks to criticise this government for failing to solve Australia's unemployment problem. This government at least is moving forward. We have a plan; a program, in fact. We have a multifaceted approach. We aim to solve what is one of Australia's chronic social problems: the unemployment not only of young people but of other people in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like my colleagues on both sides of the chamber, I was privileged to sit in the parliament when the Treasurer (Mr Costello) delivered the 1997 budget. I have always been a great admirer of the Treasurer. When I listened to those pearls of wisdom cast forth during his speech, I was reminded that he is in fact one of the greatest Treasurers this nation has ever seen. For the second year in a row, our budget helps families, helps create real jobs and boosts small business by encouraging savings and repaying our debt. This, of course, is what we seek to do as a government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year, we all know that we inherited a budget deficit of $10.3 billion, which was built up on Beazley's bankcard. We all recall those falsities uttered during the election when the now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) told us that the budget was in surplus. We all know the situation on the Monday after the election when Treasury presented the incoming government with the real figures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These people opposite can talk about spending, they can talk about a lot of things, but the simple fact of the matter is that, after 13 years in office, in their last year they had a $10.3 billion deficit. Consequently, we had to rein in expenditure last year because as a nation we simply cannot spend money that we do not have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia has already seen significant benefits as a result of the financially responsible policies of the Howard government. The 1997-98 budget was all about continuing our program to get the economic fundamentals right so that we hand this nation on to our
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> children and grandchildren in a sound economic condition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget provides choices and incentives without any increases in existing taxes or any new taxes. Labor left a legacy of deficit and debt. As a result of 13 years of Labor government, Labor left this country with debt in excess of $93 billion, and I think that is totally unacceptable. Australia was downgraded by the world's major credit agencies from a triple A rating not once but twice during the last six years. In the last five years, the former Labor government ran up $70 billion in debt, averaging $14 billion a year. This government has turned a $10.3 billion deficit into a surplus in 1998-99 of $1.6 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are talking about large amounts of money. The people of Australia are looking for performance, and they are certainly getting performance from this Treasurer and from this government. Mr Deputy Speaker, you would be aware that, over the next 12 months, we will repay over $5,000 million of debt. For the first time in nearly 10 years, this government will not run up any debt, it will not call on the savings of Australians and it will not be a borrower in the marketplace. We have done away with the concept of boom and bust that we have seen with the Labor Party as evidenced by the recessions it said we `had to have'. Under this government, as a nation we will be paying our way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will mention some of the benefits of our sound economic management. We have had a succession of interest rate reductions. The biggest endorsement of the budget and of the policies of this government has come in the form of these interest rate reductions. These are tangible benefits flowing through to all of those people who borrowed money from banks and other financial institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the budget in 1996, the responsible policies of this government have resulted in four interest rate reductions, which will save the average home buyer in the electorate of Fisher and elsewhere through the nation some $290 net per month. That is $290 in the pocket after tax. That clearly helps our local economy, the housing industry, small business, the home buyer and the home owner. This means more jobs and real jobs made
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4700"> from a growing economy. This government does have some real solutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because of the arrangement between the whips, it is not possible for me to deliver my full 20&hyphen;minute speech in this place. In the remaining few minutes before my 10 minutes are up, I just want to touch on a few matters which I think indicate that this government certainly has everything right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have employment initiatives, but our employment initiatives will ensure that people are assisted to get real long-term jobs. They are not employment initiatives which simply seek to hide people from the dole queue. Last year the Howard government created 130,000 new jobs and it is forecast to create an additional 200,000 jobs in this budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous government spent $500 million on short&hyphen;term training schemes that shifted young people through one scheme after another for six months and there was only a four per cent success rate, despite what those opposite have said. On the other hand, this government will put more resources forward for the 70 per cent of people who do not go to tertiary institutions, even though we have 12,000 increased enrolments in universities and we have created 55,000 new TAFE places. This government is establishing a training system which is responsive to the needs of industry and business enterprises while operating within a national framework that ensures that national standards and portability of standards are maintained. We will also have extra advantages in the area of apprenticeships.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other speakers have mentioned the important savings initiative. For the first time in more than a decade the Commonwealth is going to tax savings less. Most importantly for my electorate of Fisher, the savings rebate announced in the budget will assist self&hyphen;funded retirees and other retirees on fixed incomes who rely on investments or superannuation just to survive. The tax cut on savings to provide real help to families&mdash;up to $450 for each taxpayer&mdash;will be welcomed by everyone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have created additional child-care places. There will be massive additional environmental expenditure. We have intro
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> duced the work for the dole scheme. The Green Corps is another of our initiatives. Austudy changes which we have made will benefit rural and regional families such as those in the electorate of Fisher. Our regional and rural Medicare offices will remain. I congratulate the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) on the retention of the Caloundra and Kingaroy Medicare offices. We fought for this and the minister delivered. There will also be assistance for primary industry.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is sobering to recall the commitments of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to the Australian people before the last election. In relation to those areas which I have a particular interest in, those commitments were most comprehensively expressed in his speech to the Australian Council of Social Service congress on 13 October 1995. This speech was entitled by what, in retrospect, seems to be a cruel irony: `Fair Australia'. On that sunny spring day only 18 months ago, Mr Howard waxed lyrical about the future prospects of Australians under a coalition government. He said to the representatives of governments, community and welfare groups gathered at the congress:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We won't always agree on every detail of social policy, but we will always have this in common: a desire to provide greater security and fairness for those in need.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I give you this pledge: I want to do everything in my power to preserve the social fabric of this nation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He further stated:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4701">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let me also add for the record that, contrary to the claims of my Labor opponent, there is no secret plan to slash $10 billion from social welfare.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So, 18 months later, how is the government measuring up to the Prime Minister's commitments? What of the $10 billion cut to social welfare which he denied before the election was part of the coalition's agenda? I will return later in this speech to a consideration of the impact of government policy on social cohesion, the maintenance of which Mr Howard claimed was one of his main objectives. Let us look first at this promise about not making $10 billion worth of cuts to social welfare.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have been counting, Prime Minister, and after two budgets and less than half a term in office, the cuts have already exceeded $10 billion. They come from aged care, child care, social security, health, public housing and disability services. Not all of these cuts have taken effect yet. Indeed, many of the more damaging cuts in the government's first budget were coming into operation just as the second budget was introduced, foreshadowing further cuts, often affecting the same groups and individuals. Nowhere is this more evident than in child care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the first budget, the government cut $500 million from child care. In its most recent budget, it has foreshadowed another round of cuts of more than $300 million. The combined effect of these cuts is to increase the cost of child care to parents. Low income parents have been particularly badly hit, especially those who have children who attend community based centres, from which the first budget withdrew operational subsidies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In these centres&mdash;and in private centres&mdash;weekly fees have started to rise by between $20 and $40 a child. From 1 July this year, these increases will be widespread. As a result, as we are now seeing from a rising number of stories in the newspaper, increasing numbers of parents&mdash;especially mothers&mdash;are being forced to leave the work force or to place their children in cheaper, unregulated, backyard care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Centres are also being forced to close as a consequence. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been informed of
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the closure of eight centres in Victoria and six in South Australia, with many closures in other parts of the country pending. Mr Deputy Speaker Vaile, I know that you have spoken on the subject of child care, and I have no doubt that you too will know about these closures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Parents with children at these centres are outraged by the government's actions and there is nothing in this budget that will improve the affordability or the quality of child care. In fact, instead of taking responsibility for the problems of increasing costs of child care to parents, the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) has added insult to injury by blaming the child-care operators for the increasing costs of child care that result directly from the withdrawal of government funding. Instead of fixing the problem and making child care more affordable, she has accused them of ripping off the system. This is no way to deal with an issue of fundamental importance to parents of the 600,000 children using formal child-care services in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government does not seem to recognise that, without affordable child care, families cannot combine bringing up children with going out to work. It does seem to be the case that the coalition's child-care policy illustrates two fundamental aspects of its longer term agenda which certainly families around Australia are pointing out to me: firstly, they want to reduce government provision of services and, secondly, to force women out of the work force and back into the home. What a contrast this is to the sentiments the Prime Minister expressed at the ACOSS congress, where he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">More must also be done to meet one of the greatest challenges facing families today&mdash;and that is the juggling of work and child raising responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He said he would do more, not less. Then he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We remain strongly committed to the maintenance of affordable child care for families who choose paid child care arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He made no mention of $800 million of cuts. The Prime Minister should have told that to the mums for whom child-care costs have now become prohibitive, such as the mother
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4702"> of two-year-old Kane, who was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph</EMPHASIS>  this week. She quit her $31,800 job a year as an office manager just last week and applied for the sole parent pension. After government cuts, she was facing increases of $20 a week in child-care costs. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I couldn't come up with the extra $40 a fortnight. I've been forced from being a taxpayer to scabbing off the system.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">John Howard was careful to reassure his ACOSS audience of the coalition's commitment to maintenance of the welfare safety net. He said then:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will not be eroding the safety net that underpins our social security system.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A fair and compassionate society has a basic responsibility to assist the genuinely needy and disadvantaged through the provision of a strong and secure social welfare safety net.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Although ACOSS participants and the wider community could not have known it&mdash;the Prime Minister, the then Leader of the Opposition, did not tell anybody before the election&mdash;the coalition's definition of `the genuinely needy and disadvantaged' was far more strictly circumscribed than its pre-election statements would suggest. It did not include, for example, families who need child-care services, pensioners who rely on their concession cards to get reduced priced pharmaceuticals, or older retrenched workers who cannot find another job and, as a result of this government's changes&mdash;these are generally men&mdash;must use their small superannuation savings to supplement their reduced social security payments. They are no longer allowed to go on unemployment benefits and keep looking for work. If they have got superannuation, they have to take that super and retire.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of these groups and others have been disadvantaged by budget cuts which totalled over $10 billion in the first two Howard budgets. What does this do for social cohesion and, to quote the Prime Minister `a desire to provide greater security and fairness for those in need'? How can you create greater security and fairness for those in need when you take $10 billion from those in need
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in your first two budgets? The reality, of course, is quite different from statements the Prime Minister made before the election. Judged against his own objectives, he has failed abysmally in the areas of child care and social security.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at a couple of other areas of social policy: first of all, public housing. The government has failed to obtain agreement with the states on changes to the Commonwealth-state housing agreement. It has left many thousands of public housing tenants worried about the security of their tenure and the cost of their housing. The government has finally, as a result of realising that it just cannot get any signature to the changes it has proposed, signed an agreement which continues past arrangements for a further two years. But in the process, the government has cut $200 million from Commonwealth funding to the states for public housing. As these funds are matched by the states, the overall funding reductions for public housing are likely to be almost double this over the next four years. These cuts come on top of a three per cent so-called efficiency dividend applied to Commonwealth grants to the states in last year's budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In both budgets there have been cuts to rent assistance. If there is any group in our community facing poverty, it is people in private rental. But we have seen two cuts to private rent assistance in this government's first two budgets. In the first budget we saw the cut directed to single people in shared accommodation. In the recent budget we have seen the cuts directed to young people living at home in public housing contributing to their parents' rent. The combined effect of these changes is, of course, to undermine Australians' access to appropriate and affordable housing, something that I think once again contrasts with the Prime Minister's statements to ACOSS before the election, where he said `all Australians should have access to affordable housing'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Church groups have been among the most concerned by the government's changes to public housing. The diocese of Sydney, for example, in a media release in support of public housing said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4703">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Within the Diocese of Sydney there are many communities which rely on public housing. Many of these are found in inner&hyphen;city areas where private rental is exorbitant. Quite clearly there are those who, even with subsidies, will not have a roof over their heads if rentals revert to market rates. Others would have to pay upwards of 40 per cent of a limited income on rental&mdash;a recipe for strained family relationships, poor health and increased hardship.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The recent budget made few changes to aged care, perhaps because the government realises the political fallout from its first budget changes. They totalled $500 million in cuts. Most of these are yet to come into effect because they depend on the passage of the Aged Care Bill. However, older people are starting to realise the impact of the coalition's proposed changes. They will make access to nursing home care dependent on the ability to pay rather than the need for care. They will introduce two tiers of accommodation and care in our hostels and nursing homes&mdash;one for those who can pay and another for those who cannot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are not just my views. Let us have a look at those who are running the nursing homes and hostels. In a press release last week the Uniting Church said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Passage of this bill and the supporting subsidies seriously risks undermining the current standard of aged care in Australia. It is a short sighted attempt to redress the problems of the industry, made at the expense of the most vulnerable elderly Australians.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Australian Catholic Health Care Association said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Minister Moylan's changes to the aged care reforms will cement in place a two tiered system that will see financially disadvantaged people pushed even further into the margins of a society divided by an individual's capacity to pay.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The proposed changes and their likely consequences are a stark reminder of the effect of the coalition's obsession with market forces and user pays in places which are not appropriate to the market. When it comes to security, families need to know that their elderly relatives can get into a nursing home when they need to and that it will not depend on how much money they have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are other serious consequences of this government's cuts to older people. These include increased charges for home and com
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> munity care, increased costs of pharmaceuticals, the abolition of the dental health program, stricter eligibility criteria for health care and concessional cards and, as I mentioned before, the requirement to count superannuation in income for those over the age of 55 who had previously been seeking jobsearch allowance. Taken together, these make a mockery of the Prime Minister's commitment in October 1995 to `reduce the uncertainty currently felt by many pensioners and self&hyphen;funded retirees'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1997 budget increased support for carers through enhancements to the domiciliary nursing care benefit, extension of eligibility for the carer pension, and additional funding for carers support and information. As I have said before in this place, I welcome these initiatives which help to recognise the great contribution of carers to our community. However, I am dismayed to see that these measures have been funded through stricter eligibility of the child disability allowance; a payment to the parents of children with disabilities. Overall, spending on people with disabilities has decreased by $19 million; a fact overlooked in all the government hype about greater assistance to people with disabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have not mentioned other cuts that are part of the $10 billion cuts to the social welfare safety net in health or labour market programs because others will do so. I want to conclude with some general observations about the factors influencing the coalition's social policies and the effects these policies will have on the society that we live in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been stated many times that the Prime Minister's view of our society is stuck somewhere in the 1950s&mdash;some sort of golden age where all children lived in two&hyphen;parent families, all women stayed at home and looked after their children, their elderly, their disabled and worked as volunteers in their spare time. What we know in 1997 is that this is just not the case. Even the government I think recognises this. Yet its social policies are striving to create or recreate such a society, and they are doomed to fail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Opponents of the government's policies have tended to focus on their impact on the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4704"> most vulnerable in our society. This is understandable, since these policies have had a disproportionate adverse impact upon these groups. Just ask the Aboriginal people of this country. Concentrating on very disadvantaged groups has tended to disguise an important truth&mdash;that is, the government's social policies when fully implemented will also have a profound and negative effect upon many lower and middle income Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Such an impact is already evident in analyses of the effect of the coalition's first budget. A study by the Institute of Economic and Social Research at Melbourne University concluded that the direct effect on households of the changes was a fall of $3.50 a week or $7 a week when social wage income was considered. The study went on to say that the changes will have the greatest impact on the poor and, as a package, are regressive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One and two income families on low to average salaries are among the groups who will lose out. The much vaunted family tax package has long ago been swallowed up in costs of pharmaceuticals, higher education and child care. The savings tax rebate, which is only going to be valuable to those with considerable savings, is going to offer no assistance to pensioners. The pensioners have made their views about this budget very clear in their New South Wales newspaper&mdash;`1997 budget ignores pensioners'. They know that that rebate&mdash;which they will not even get&mdash;has well and truly been overtaken by increased charges for HACC, for pharmaceuticals and for the costs of entering hostels and nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, and most disturbing, is the way in which the government's social policies have served to exacerbate divisions in our community between self&hyphen;funded retirees and pensioners, between new migrants and people long established here, between the elderly competing for services in short supply, between adults and children with disabilities, between people in the work force and those outside it, and between Aborigines and everybody else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a far cry from the optimism of the ACOSS meeting, where the Prime Minister proclaimed, `I want to do everything in my
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> power to preserve the social fabric of this nation.' What we see after 18 months in office&mdash;what we can observe&mdash;is the social fabric unravelling before our eyes. It is time for the government to actually reassess its policies and pull back before the divisions opening up in our society overwhelm us all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government should listen to what the electorate is saying. It is clear that job security is their primary concern, but families and individuals need to know that the social services that they rely on will be there when they need them&mdash;when they are sick, when they need child care or when they cannot afford to buy a house or rent. They need to know that those services will be there. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

I am afraid that the Labor Party, that held so much for the battlers of Australia, is no more. The Labor Party that stood for principle is no more. The Labor Party which wished for a great Australia based on wealth for all and a future with hope is no more. The Labor Party, so proudly standing for something, is no more&mdash;no more principles, no more policy, no more ideas, no more leadership, no more. Those Australians who once placed their future and their families' future on the Labor Party being in government are, in fact, no more.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, you may ask how I know such things. A short cursory look at the responses to this budget&mdash;the second Howard government budget delivered by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) just three weeks ago&mdash;and a look at the opposition responses confirmed the death of the Labor Party as we once knew it in this place. What we have now is a Labor Party devoid of ideas, a party looking for inspiration for the future, a party so keen to talk about its failed 13 years in government, so actively rewarded by their constituency last year and a party that has no ideas at all. The trouble is that the Labor Party which is no more creates more trouble for the country
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4705"> than it did when it was in government. How, you ask.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the Howard government move to rectify their sloth and avarice in office, we need an opposition which are prepared to offer an alternative. What do we get? Nothing but a wish to return to the past and the roots that they jettisoned over the last 12 years. We now have the Left trying to be Right and the Right trying to be Left. The new messiahs are prophesying. One of my colleagues mentioned the other day that the new leadership messiahs of the Labor Party were not really messiahs; they were just naughty little boys. But I guess each Monday when the comrades opposite now read the Glenn Milne policy piece, they will always sing that fabulous song of the 1970s which the Labor Party wants to go back to: `Always look on the bright side of life'. The Labor Party need to look on the bright side of life because they left us on the dark side of the moon after their period in office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What great achievement did the Labor Party leave us when they left office? What great new age achievement did the government leave us? What are we all grateful for to the former Labor government? Let us take a few moments to reflect on this great list of achievements. Let us think for a few moments about the list.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, I think you are finding it difficult to create this list. Let me remind you that when the disgraced Labor Party were comprehensively thrown out of government last March&mdash;15 months ago&mdash;they left us with chronic unemployment. Speaker after speaker in this debate on the other side spoke of the unemployment position. Let me remind the House that it was Labor which, at the start of this decade, had an unemployment rate of 6.2 per cent. They took us to an unemployment rate of over 11 per cent. They gave us 26 per cent youth unemployment. The Labor Party took us from an average unemployment period of 33 weeks to 55 weeks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party doubled the number of long-term unemployed. The failed Labor government have no credibility to speak on unemployment issues. When they failed to take the necessary reforms to ensure competi
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tiveness in the workplace, they worsened job shedding. They stand before us and say, `Do more about unemployment.' I am sure that we will, but they have voted against labour market reforms in this place, something that every employer in Australia says is vital to increase employment opportunities. They have also voted against tax reform, another reform which every employer in Australia says is essential for employment opportunities. Their leadership still says that they will not support further tax reform. This confirms that the messages from the Labor Party are no more than dull torches rather than a blazing arc of neon&mdash;that light on the hill that we used to hear about so many years ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party are tall on rhetoric yet very short on action. They had 13 years in which to get their act together, yet they failed miserably. The Labor Party left us with enormous foreign debt&mdash;an 800 per cent increase from when they took office. Labor gave us the worst current account in the OECD, worse than Mexico's. Labor gave us high interest rates. Labor reduced our living standards from a rank of 10th to 22nd in the world. Productivity under Labor was around 10 per cent lower than the OECD average. Labor broke promises and never delivered their legislative tax cuts. Labor reduced national savings. Under Labor, investment and growth fell. Labor's deficits in their 13 years total $55 billion. Labor tripled Commonwealth debt. Labor sold off assets to pay for their expenditure. Labor increased their tax take by 10 per cent in their last term in office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party failed Australia. They failed the Australian battlers who cried for them back in 1975&mdash;those Australian battlers who do not read Phillip Adams or follow Bill Hunter's movie career. They have come to realise that the New Labor is nothing more than a charade. The do nothing, say nothing, Tim Shaws of Australian politics are, in fact, the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But wait, here is more: the Labor Party say, `We were going to fix it in our 14th year; we were going to fix unemployment.' But wait, there is more: `We were going to fix the debt. We were going to fix everything. We were going to fix it in our 14th year.' But unfortu

They do not believe their shallow promises, they do not believe Labor policies and they do not believe this New Labor that is going around&mdash;the New Labor that is prepared to do anything and say anything to return to power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us review some of Labor's pearls of wisdom during this appropriation debate. The Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, said, `At the very least, the budget should be good economics.' That is absolutely right. Pray tell me, Mr Deputy Speaker, is reducing dead debt good economics? I am sure it is. Is reducing outlays good economics? Is rewarding savings good economics? Mr Deputy Speaker, I am sure you will agree that it would be. Strike one, then, for the budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans) says the budget does nothing. Wrong. It reduces debt. The member for Holt says the budget does nothing for savings. Wrong. It reduces tax on savings. Strike two for the budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) says that we have no plan. He says the Howard government has no plan&mdash;no plan to reduce debt? No plan to reduce outlays? No plan to reduce tax on savings? No plan to give confidence to the Australian community? No plan to give Australia the financial responsibility it so deserves?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Brisbane said in his speech financial responsibility is nothing to be proud of and, by implication, says he is happy with debt. He is on the front bench of the Labor Party, so the Labor Party, by implication, is happy for Australia to be in debt. By implication, he says he is happy to have high taxes. By implication, he agrees with taxing savings. By implication, his plan is for high taxes and high outlays. The member for Brisbane proudly boasts about the Labor Party having three surpluses in 13 years. They had 13 loan bills. We will be back in surplus within our first term, our first three years. The member says we have no plan. We have a plan all right, and that plan is to get this country out
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of debt and get us focused on renewing wealth and sharing it around within this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The saddest speech was from the poor former Treasurer, the member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis), who tried very hard to justify his period as Treasurer. Perhaps we could have believed him, as he was so passionate about what he was saying, except for a couple of points: Labor gave us the worst recession in 60 years, they gave us record small business interest rates, they gave us foreign debt which was out of control, they gave us the worst unemployment rate since the recession in the 1930s, they increased taxes when they promised not to do so, and they gave us the worst current account&mdash;worse than Mexico's. The list just goes on and on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As much as I like anyone who lives in my home town of Williamstown in Melbourne, I can tell the former Treasurer, who has only just moved there, I think, that we from Williamstown do not like debt either. Some Australians who should know, those Australians who do not have a political barrow to push, have commented on the budget. One of them, Mark Paterson from the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is a good budget which will go a long way towards restoring growth and lowering unemployment. Its defining characteristic is stability. It maintains an even keel while improving sales and building confidence.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is clear the only ones who do not like this budget are in fact the new Labor Party and their fellow travellers&mdash;the new Labor Party who love debt, the new Labor Party who love high taxes, the new Labor Party who love taxing savings, the new Labor Party who love high government outlays&mdash;the new Labor Party with old ideas, though; the new Labor Party with the same old ideas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">New Labor have yet to listen to the electorate. They have yet to listen to what the people, the Australian battlers, are saying&mdash;and they are saying a few things.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What distinguishes the circumstances of the parties in the parliament&mdash;in this House and in the Senate but, for the purpose of this point, particularly in this House&mdash;is that those of us in the Labor Party have a leader of whom we are all very proud and those on the opposite side have a leader of whom at least some of them are ashamed. And that is a particularly important distinction. Some of them are making that shame public in their views about the attitude of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to the stolen children report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I want today to focus on the distinction as it relates to this budget and in particular as the budget relates to employment, the economy, industrial relations, the macro consequences for the economy as a whole and the human consequences for some of the individuals affected by those outcomes. What do we see in the broader Australian economy at the moment, and what does it say about the context in which we receive this budget and about the outcome from the previous budget? There can be speculation about the outcome of this budget&mdash;whether it will achieve its objectives or not. I will make some comments about that in a moment, but we are all gazing into a foggy crystal ball. It is not clear. Nobody knows.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we do know something about this government's first budget: we know it was a failure&mdash;an absolute, terrible, catastrophic failure. And that will be proved tomorrow. The growth figures will come out tomorrow.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Nobody knows exactly what they will say, but we know that they will say last year's budget objective for growth has not been achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also know that the mid-year review revised forecast of a budget of growth outcomes for last year will not be achieved. And why is that? Anyone who heard the previous speaker, the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans), would be excused for not knowing that the reason is that this 12-month period that tomorrow's growth figures will measure is the first 12 months that have been entirely the responsibility of this government. Up until now, the annual growth figures have been higher because they have included the higher growth numbers under the previous government. But this will be the first 12 months measuring the exclusive responsibility of the Howard government, and they will be appalling growth numbers&mdash;probably somewhere between two and three per cent, far below the four per cent that everybody acknowledges we need to start to get unemployment down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this budget, as brought down by the Treasurer (Mr Costello), achieves the numbers to which it aspires&mdash;and I am pessimistic about that&mdash;it will not achieve four per cent in any year this century. What that means is that we are essentially condemning those people who are unemployed by maintaining that level of unemployment for the remainder of this century&mdash;an appalling outcome. It means the continuing failure of this government on job creation and a falling, floundering economic performance. It is very bad for this country overall in terms of the tragic loss of potential, wasted productivity and wasted lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it has extra problems for some groups in particular. Because I want to speak on other matters, I cannot comment on all of those many groups. But you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker Quick, that it can have a particular impact in some regions, because your state is one that is particularly adversely affected. There are other regions particularly adversely affected, including of course the Newcastle region, so struck by the consequences of the failure of this government's industry policy and so left to its own devices without any assistance from this government.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4708"> There are regional groups; there are all sorts of groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to mention two groups because they were features of this government's election campaign when it said that it would do something substantial for them&mdash;and they are the long-term unemployed and unemployed youth. I do not know whether anybody remembers&mdash;maybe nobody bothers to talk about the things that were said in the election because they cannot tell which were core promises and which were non-core promises&mdash;but I thought doing something about the long-term unemployed and youth unemployment were probably seen as major promises of that government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet what do we see after 12 months, from March 1996 to March 1997? We see an increase in long&hyphen;term unemployment by 14,000, and last month's figures indicate that it is getting worse; the percentage of the long-term unemployed going up; youth unemployment rising in absolute terms; and, most starkly of all, the percentage of full-time youth labour force unemployed rising from 27.4 per cent to 29.4 per cent. I never had a great deal of faith in that last figure as a measure. The absolute numbers have gone up. That is important; that clearly is measuring a problem. The percentage can be very misleading, but it is a figure that was trotted out month after month by this government when they were in opposition. We find a stony silence from them now they are the government and those same figures are telling against them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an indictment of them that youth unemployment is rising. I do not want to put too much weight on the measurement of the percentage, because all sorts of factors come into that. I simply condemn the government for the hypocrisy they showed in opposition about that. But the absolute numbers of long-term unemployed and the absolute numbers of youth unemployed are rising.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mention that important macro&hyphen;economic background to raise some particular issues. What is the government's response? The only weapon the government has and uses to deal with this question is the interest rates weapon. It uses it for growth stimulus, because it
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> eschews all the other mechanisms of fiscal management. Of course, basic economics tells us that reduced interest rates will eventually have some positive impact on economic growth. Certainly in any econometric model that is the outcome. It also says that it is untargeted. You cannot target it to your areas of primary concern and there are long and sometimes unpredictable lags.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also know that in the real world, as against the econometric models, there are other factors you have to take into account. In Australia in 1997 one of those factors is the resistance of consumer and investor response to reduced interest rates because of the falling levels of consumer confidence and business confidence. Therefore, interest rates are a very ineffective, slow&hyphen;moving, untargeted mechanism to deal with the great problem of unemployment. It is a condemnation of the government that it fails to use, and deliberately chooses not to use, the principal weapon of fiscal policy to respond to this serious problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, as shadow minister for industrial relations, I want to refer in particular to the consequences of the use of that interest rate policy for the wages of ordinary Australians who are out there trying to support a family on the basic wages they earn as employees. The government came to office saying that it did not believe in centralised wage fixation. All around Australia people are laughing about that. They know that what it means is that the government did not think the Industrial Relations Commission, before which everybody could appear and put their case, should have a role in centralised wage fixation; it should be done by the Reserve Bank of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a very centralised wage fixation system determined by a line in the sand drawn by the Reserve Bank. But no-one gets a chance to appear before it and put their point of view. No-one gets a chance to put their special concerns about why the decisions that are being made might be adverse to their interest. There is no capacity to respond to special problems or particular circumstances. There is no flexibility. It is a very blunt instrument&mdash;necessarily so. That is not a
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4709"> criticism of the Reserve Bank. There is no capacity to manage monetary policy in that sort of targeted way that other elements of policy can. So, firstly, it is blunt, unfair and no-one gets a chance to appear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, those who restrain their wages the most are those who get the least benefit from the falling interest rates. The evidence on the distribution of mortgages shows that, on average, only 11 per cent of the lowest 40 per cent of income households have mortgages. They are the people getting the least benefit from the interest rate cuts, yet the wage figures show they are the people showing the greatest restraint. The two&hyphen;tier labour market that this industrial relations structure of this government is making inevitable&mdash;with increases for those with bargaining power rising more quickly than the increases for those on the award only system, and this system will make that worse&mdash;is being exacerbated by the fact that those people who show the greatest restraint get the least reward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is possible also that this government is significantly underestimating the importance of executive salaries in the increased average weekly ordinary&hyphen;time earnings numbers on which it and the Reserve Bank are basing their policies. That is an issue we will have to look at later. The other problem I have is that this interest rate policy simply cannot work. It is unsustainable because monetary policy has broader ramifications. Interest rates are not an autonomous variable that you can just use in response to concerns about wages policy. It has an impact on the currency, which can be a much bigger issue for inflation. The Governor of the Reserve Bank, before the House of Representatives Financial Institutions and Public Administration Committee recently, said that the biggest factor in the recent reduction in inflation was the appreciation of the exchange rate. Yet, as our interest rates fall and the US interest rates go up, that will inevitably have an impact on the Australian currency. We are already starting to see some small drop in the currency since the last interest rates move.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In some ways with the economy overall that is not necessarily a bad thing. It is not the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> issue I want to get into a debate about now, but its inflationary consequences are evident and serious, much more important than an 11 per cent wage increase for truck drivers. A change in the value of the currency is a much bigger factor for inflation than any of the wage claims before the Industrial Relations Commission&mdash;certainly much bigger than any decision the Industrial Relations Commission might have made to give a decent wage increase to those dependent on the award system, instead of the trifling, inadequate decision which it made&mdash;which was fortunately better than that which the government offered, but still inadequate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we have an unsustainable strategy because the very instrument that we are trying to use as an economic stimulus can only eventually work in the opposite direction as it starts to have an impact on the relative value of our currency, and therefore on inflation, and the capacity therefore to continue to use that as a weapon for economic stimulus and wages policy at the same time cannot be sustained. Therefore, serious problems for our economy are in the offing in terms of the potential to stimulate increased economic growth. In the interim what we have is an unfair policy, unfairly impacting on wage and salary earners, an unworkable and ultimately unsuccessful policy directed unfairly to wage and salary earners, particularly lower wage and salary earners. I note it is directed towards wages, not towards incomes. Those whose incomes are otherwise derived are not required to express the same restraint. I regard that as an important issue and an important condemnation of the inadequacy of this budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to talk about the unfair dismissals fiasco that has been added to the problems for workers from the wages policy. We had the government, at the last election, promising that they would not have a small business exemption. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of 20 February 1996, an article quoting the then shadow minister for industrial relations&mdash;his name was Mr Reith&mdash;stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The coalition has flatly ruled out any exemption for small business in its redrafted unfair dismissal laws despite a plea that the sector should not be subject to the same treatment as the big end of town. The
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4710"> author of the policy, the opposition's industrial relations spokesman, Mr Peter Reith, said the redrafted system would not contain any exemptions.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Just in case anyone thought he was misunderstood, on 28 February he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our position is very clear. If you have been unfairly dealt with at work, then you should have a right of appeal.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And 1.3 million Australians believed him and found that he was not telling the truth. At the first opportunity they have broken that commitment and there are many other commitments made by the Prime Minister to the same effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the Senate said, `We'd like to hold you to that promise,' they went further. They did not just breach it as much as they originally proposed. They went further and they threatened a double dissolution about it, failing to tell people that the exemption they are proposing is an exemption to their own law, that they have broken the promises they made but, more than this, that they are adversely affecting the lives of 1.3 million Australians&mdash;those who work for small business who will be affected by this, who are already feeling insecure, stressed and uncertain. It makes their lives worse, not better. It robs them of their rights, it robs them of their day in court. It is damaging our society and dividing our society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you want to look at it economically, it increases insecurity in the workplace and is going to lead to falling consumer confidence and a reduced capacity and preparedness of Australian workers to commit themselves to mortgages and other long&hyphen;term contracts that are important if the interest rate cuts are going to flow through the economy and lead to increased consumer confidence. At the very time that that is being proposed, these changes are reducing that confidence because they are making people's job insecurity worse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It may be part of the explanation why changes to unfair dismissal laws that took place on 1 January are having no impact on improved job numbers. There is no correlation at all. In fact, in Victoria, the state where they are operating most unfettered and there is no state unfair dismissal law to interfere, since the new unfair dismissal laws came in the rate
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of job growth has fallen. The last Bureau of Statistics figures said that the trend changed in January and started to fall, at the very time, if you believe the government's story, it should have been starting to increase.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More importantly than the economic consequence and the failure economically, it is a human story. I want to quote one story that has been referred to me. It was a story that was settled out of court on confidential terms, so I cannot give all the details, but I can vouch for its authenticity. I cannot use all the words that are in the summary of this case. They would be distinctly unparliamentary. I will go as close as I can without breaching your tolerance, Mr Deputy Speaker.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pleasure to be able to support the second budget brought down by the Treasurer, Mr Costello, and the Howard&hyphen;Fischer government. The previous speaker, the member for Canberra (Mr McMullan), alluded to a couple of elements of the budgetary process. One was interest rates, and I will come to that in a minute, and the other was promises and broken promises.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last major broken promise that the people of Australia will recall the Labor Party perpetrated on this nation was just prior to the election when they told the people of Australia that there was a $700 million surplus in the budget. When they were thrown out of office at the election in 1996 and the coalition was elected, we were confronted with a $10&half; billion deficit in real terms. The problem was that the Labor Party could not differentiate between headline figures and real figures. They included asset sales that were not achieved. They also did a lot of fudging of the figures at the margins.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government will turn that $10&half; billion deficit into a $1.6 billion surplus in just three years. The people of Australia know that is a task that has to be undertaken. They know it is a task that is going to be tough on all sections of Australia, but they also know it is one that has to be undertaken. Addressing that problem is foremost in our minds&mdash;and certainly in the minds of everybody around Australia&mdash;if we want to build a nation that
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is worth while for our children to inherit in the future. That is basically what this budget is all about. It has added to the foundation that was laid in the budget of August 1996, and it has certainly produced the goods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following the budget, we have had a further reduction in interest rates. The previous speaker spoke of interest rates and the role the Reserve Bank is playing in monetary policy. As he put it, the bank has drawn a line in the sand for the speed limit on wages, the speed limit on inflation and the agreement we have on them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we achieve a stable labour market with stable salaries, stable inflation and stable interest rates&mdash;and we believe we will&mdash;we should get steady economic growth. We should get inflation at one per cent. Unions and other parties are calling for 11 per cent wage increases. They are the things that do have an effect on interest rates. The previous speaker pooh&hyphen;poohed the interest rate regime that this government has vigorously pursued and which has recently seen interest rates on mortgages with some lenders drop to about 6.9 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the earlier speakers tonight, the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin)&mdash;who concentrated most of her address in the House on some of her portfolio responsibilities with regard to child care and aged care&mdash;also referred to some research that had been done that indicated that budget changes this government had introduced impacted in a negative way at the rate of $7 per week per family. Just for the information of the House, a family with a $100,000 mortgage&mdash;the average mortgage across Australia&mdash;will have benefited from those interest rate cuts to the tune of $290 a month. That is $290 tax-free, in the pocket.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the goal of this government is to ease the burden on everybody in Australia through that interest rate regime. It is exactly the opposite to the focus taken by the previous government and the previous Prime Minister&mdash;in particular, in his earlier career as the Treasurer. We all recall that, between March 1988 and November 1989, the cash rate was lifted by nearly eight percentage points. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4712">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had an MPI this evening about small businesses, and the opposition claim to be bleeding hearts at the moment about the circumstances of small business. But the policy that has done the most damage to small business is the interest rate regime the Labor Party ran when they were in government in the late 1980s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us not forget what former Treasurer Keating did, and I will quote from an article that was in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Keating had returned from his summer holiday all fired up about the way in which Noosa was full of bulldozers. He wanted the Reserve to lift rates by 2 percentage points in one hit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Reserve procrastinated but, under daily urging from Don Russell, lifted the rate by 1.75 percentage points.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Between March 1988 and November 1989 the cash rate was lifted by nearly 8 percentage points, with Paul Keating cracking the whip. Rates were pushed too high for too long.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Then, at the end of 1989, Don Russell . . . heard the economy snap&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Indeed it did&mdash;it snapped. The Labor government of the late 1980s broke the economy. Remember the words of the then Treasurer (Mr Keating) about the recession we had to have? That is what did the most damage to small business and to the farming community in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Eight years later they still have not recovered and that is why the Howard&hyphen;Fischer coalition government is hell&hyphen;bent and totally focused on maintaining a low interest rate regime. The mechanisms we have put in place as far as the economy is concerned will maintain that low inflation and low interest regime in this country. It will provide benefits to everybody in this nation, particularly to the small business community. They ought not to forget that. They ought not to lose sight of the fact that that is exactly where it is targeted because it is that sector of the economy&mdash;we have heard from speakers on both sides of this House&mdash;which crows about the ability of small business to create employment. If every single small business in Australia employed one more person there would be no unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is unashamedly focusing on the policy settings that are going to benefit
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> small business the most with regard to the interest rate regime, the availability of finance at that low interest rate, low inflation, a stable wages regime and a fair industrial relations regime. The member for Canberra alluded in great detail to the industrial relations regime. During my travels around my electorate in the lead&hyphen;up to the last election, if there was one issue alone that absolutely every small business person spoke about it was unfair dismissal. They said, `If you don't get in there and do something about unfair dismissal we will just walk out of here. We are not going to employ any more people. Not only that, we will walk out of this business because the Labor government has killed us with interest rates and they are killing us with the unfair dismissal laws.' They were talking about the Laurie Brereton and Martin Ferguson concocted unfair dismissal regime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government did do something about it. But after the first round of changes to the Industrial Relations Act last year, which were negotiated through the Senate, there were still concerns from the small business community. So there were more changes that accommodated small business. I do not dispute the facts that were raised by the member for Canberra that there are certain cases where people are unfairly dismissed. They should have their right of recourse and they do. But what is more important is the opportunity for those people to get a job in the first place&mdash;the opportunity to participate in the work force in Australia and to make a contribution as far as this nation is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A few things have been said since the budget was introduced and there has been a great deal of criticism by the Labor Party of the government's tax rebate on savings. They have said that it does not benefit anybody and that you have to have $60,000. They ask how it is going to benefit pensioners. I do not know whether they have talked to the pensioners in their electorates but a lot of the pensioners in my electorate are part pensioners: they have a bit of money invested and they get a bit of income from savings. They will benefit from this regime. They might not have $60,000 invested and they might not get the full benefit of $450 a year. But it does not
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4713"> matter whether they get 15c in $1 or $15 in $100, they will still receive a benefit&mdash;a benefit they never had any hope of getting under Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even if Labor had been serious and genuine about introducing the l&hyphen;a&hyphen;w tax cuts&mdash;which they were never going to introduce&mdash;the part pensioners and self&hyphen;funded retirees were never going to get any benefit out of them. But under our regime and under this policy setting they will. Self&hyphen;funded pensioners and retirees will get some benefit from our policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard criticism about the government's changes to things like the pharmaceutical scheme. It is the scaremongering that gets very annoying. We suffered it in the election. I have a reasonable amount of respect for the member for Jagajaga but she just cannot help herself&mdash;she is constantly scaremongering. Another example of their scaremongering took place during the election campaign in my electorate, where lots of pensioners received bogus Telstra bills. They were frightened half out of their wits. They said, `I paid my telephone account. What am I getting another one for?' When we got to the bottom of it we found it was being done by the Labor Party and the unions to frighten people. That is all they have done; they have run a campaign of fear and loathing and scaremongering. It is the same story with all of these things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government members are trying to get the message out to the people of Australia that we are concerned about those areas. The changes we are making are for the long&hyphen;term good of this nation. They will not severely disadvantage anybody who cannot protect themselves. That is the fact of every single policy that this government has laid down since it got into power, particularly in the 1997&hyphen;98 budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I referred earlier to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. I had a lot to do, in the early stages when we were in opposition, with pushing the then government to recognise the availability of generic drugs and to allow the substitution of generic drugs. After much pressure and a couple of years they did do that. I forget who was the minister for health at the time; it may have been the member for
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) who was the minister and who recognised that need. We have gone a step further and said that if there is a generic replacement available it should be used because the taxpayers of Australia should be able to buy the best and the most efficient product. But we are still going to provide a product that is prescribed. Let people be aware that that is the case; the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) has made that abundantly clear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish I had more time to go over the rest of the things in the budget but I would close by saying to the people of Australia: be wary of the scaremongering of the Labor Party. They lost the last election and they are still reeling from that. They are reeling from the fact that we have been able to reduce interest rates in the first 18 months of this government's term.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one question I would like the Prime Minister to answer: is unemployment, with all its attendant social ills, this nation's greatest problem and priority&mdash;above party politics and above the political point scoring of all of us? Is it more important than sectional interests? That is what I would like to hear from this Prime Minister. We need to get some common ground in this country and I think that is where we should start. So I would say to the Prime Minister if he is out there listening: is unemployment our highest priority? After a year in office I cannot see the signs that the Prime Minister does regard it as his highest priority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year's unemployment forecasts simply were not met. Unemployment went up rather than down. Yet, there has been no change in policy. We are expressly told that this budget continues the direction of the first budget. But why should it? The first budget did nothing to help reduce unemployment. In fact, it proved to be counter&hyphen;productive.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4714">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I see BHP abandoning steel production in Newcastle, I also badly want to ask the Prime Minister this question about unemployment and to hear the Prime Minister's answer. The Australian people have supported BHP through thick and thin, and Labor's steel plan gave immense support to BHP. For them to now pull out from Newcastle borders on treason. What is the Prime Minister's reaction? Can anyone tell me? There has not been anything that one would class as a reaction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister is showing no leadership at all. He is letting it all happen around him. He simply has not grasped what leadership is all about. For him, it is always the apology without any responsibility: `I am sorry about BHP closing down in Newcastle, but there is nothing we can do about it. I am sorry about the number of long&hyphen;term unemployed rising, but they will just have to wait for the economy to pick up, because there is nothing we can do about it. I am sorry about the stolen children, but there is nothing we can do about it.' I am old enough to remember the line in the film <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Love Story</EMPHASIS>&mdash;`Love means never having to say you're sorry'. In 1997, being John Howard means always having to say you are sorry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is no wonder that people are not relaxed and comfortable at all and that some of those who supported the Liberal Party at the last election are now giving the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) and her party a second look. This Prime Minister was elected on a fundamental fraud and deceit practised on the Australian people. He encouraged people who were concerned about unemployment and job insecurity to think that he was going to do something about those things and that they could vote for him on that basis. But he never had any intention of doing anything about those things. This budget does nothing about jobs and nothing to replace the labour market programs that Labor painstakingly put in place through Working Nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government cut 117,000 opportunities for young people. What did they put back? A laughable 10,000 work for the dole places. And they want a tick for it! The junior minister for employment, the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the light of the Prime Minister's failure to tackle the unemployment problem, all we hear about in this country now is the shabby, divisive politics of race&mdash;what an ugly country we are fast becoming. We all have some responsibility for this. The member for Oxley has a lot to answer for but, to be candid, she does not know a whole lot better. I am much more concerned about the Prime Minister's lack of leadership, his failure to properly attack and rebut the member for Oxley and his failure to do anything about the unemployment and insecurity off which she is feeding.</PARA>

Just in the last couple of days, the French Left scored a stunning victory. One radio account I heard said, `People wanted to hear about job creation and solutions to unemployment, not incessant rhetoric about the deficit and the need for cutbacks.' Does that sound familiar?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the United States, President Clinton was re&hyphen;elected in November last year when voters rejected the policies which had been promoted by the Republican controlled congress and by the congressional leader Newt Gingrich in particular. In Britain just a matter of weeks ago, Labour won a massive victory over the Conservatives, who suffered their worst electoral outcome for over 50 years. Britain's measures of inequality are the worst in the Western world, equivalent with those of Russia and worse than many other nations&mdash;including undeveloped nations. There are more people in poverty in Britain than ever before, including more children in poverty than ever before. Those Thatcher legacies of growing inequality and poverty have been rejected very soundly by the British voters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What a dreadful example this government is setting in other areas, including ministerial standards. It is ironic that questions have been asked in the last couple of days about how the former senator Short came to be appointed to a position that he did not apply for until after the close of applications, because it is all something that has happened before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Back in 1993, soon after the change of government in Victoria, the Department of Business and Employment advertised for a `general manager&mdash;employment' with a remuneration package of $103,607&hyphen;$109,067. That was not a bad package then, and it is not
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a bad package now. Applications were to close by the close of business on 9 August 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some months later&mdash;long after the close of applications&mdash;a handwritten note from the departmental secretary, George Brouwer, indicated that he had received a phone call inquiring whether an appointment had been made to this position and whether this person could still put in an application. She wrote to the department on 21 October, more than two months after the close of applications, indicating that she wished to apply for the position and saying, `I am excited about the opportunities the position offers.' Given that she was managing a Footscray employment project with a package of around $45,000, no doubt she was excited by the $103,000 salary.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4716">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is little wonder that the Liberal Party works so hard to break down proper Public Service staffing and accountability processes and that it is so hard to make the Public Service more like the private sector. After all, those merit protection and accountability processes just get in the way of jobs for the boys and girls.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While we are on the subject of ministerial standards, I want to call on the federal Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) to explain just why it is that Liberal Party election donation records list a private sector health firm using his post office box. The Australian Electoral Commission returns list Ramsay Health Care (Victoria) Pty Ltd, a company which operates private hospitals, as donating $10,000 to the Liberal Party's federal secretariat. AEC records show that company as operating from Post Office Box 31, Box Hill. But Post Office Box 31 is a taxpayer funded service provided to the minister by the Department of Administrative Services. That is a service intended for use by the member in the discharge of his duties, certainly not for any private business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister must explain why a private sector company is listed as operating from this post office box. Quite clearly, such an arrangement is well outside the regulations governing the provision of that service. Why is it that the Liberal Party returns show that company as having made a donation from Dr Wooldridge's post office box address, which is for his electorate office mail?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Appropriation Bill provides us with an opportunity of asking whether current funding for the Australian Electoral Commission is adequate and whether the existing laws concerning election campaign donation disclosures are adequate. In addition, I think that an examination of the list of donors raises doubts as to whether the spirit of these disclosure laws is being observed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Liberal Party continues to shield its biggest donors from proper scrutiny. A study of the Liberal Party's returns shows that two of its largest donors in 1995-96 were, first, the Free Enterprise Foundation, which donated $3 million to the party's federal secretariat, and, second, the Cormack Foundation, which
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> contributed $1.5 million to the party's Victorian division.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Disclosure laws have not made these donations transparent in any way. The Australian community knows absolutely nothing about the sources of these donations. Where political parties choose to mask donations behind trust funds or third parties, the legislation requiring disclosure fails to achieve its purpose. Under those circumstances, I believe there is a strong case for it to be reviewed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While Minister Wooldridge prepares a plausible explanation for the post office box donation, he might also like to note other anomalies. The same Electoral Commission return for the Liberal Party's federal secretariat indicates a donation from a company in the minister's electorate, H.J. Reece Pty Ltd, of Burwood, which donated $5,000. Yet there does not appear to be any separate disclosure submitted to the Australian Electoral Commission by this company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, in its Australian Electoral Commission return, the Victorian division of the Liberal Party lists a series of company donors located in the Chisholm electorate which also do not appear to have made separate disclosures. They include the Direct Selling Association, in Notting Hill, which donated $4,000, and Taxi Australia, of Oakleigh, which contributed $2,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister should also be made aware, if he is not already aware, that the following firm located in his electorate may also have failed to submit a return. Garry and Warren Smith, of Oakleigh, donated $1,500 to the 500 Club in Melbourne, an associated entity of the Liberal Party. While we are on the subject of car dealerships, it is also worth noting that the company New Oakleigh Motors, another Oakleigh based car dealership, did submit a company disclosure declaring a donation of $5,555. However, my office has not been able to locate a disclosure by the Liberal Party, or an associated entity, which actually records this donation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister may wish to insist that he is unable to shed any light on these anomalies, but that is not to say that his office has played no role in creating them. I understand that the minister's chief of staff, Mr Ken
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4717"> Smith, often introduces himself when talking to health groups and professionals with the declaration that he knows very little about the health industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does Mr Smith know about company donations to the Liberal Party in the Chisholm electorate? What does he know about the reported $250,000 that was spent by the minister in the last Chisholm campaign? What does he know about the sources of that funding? What does he know about Ramsay Health Care being listed at the minister's taxpayer funded post office box? What does he know about Liberal Party donors in Chisholm who may not have submitted the appropriate disclosure forms to the Electoral Commission?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue of campaign donations and their reporting is a very serious issue. The apparent failure of the minister to explain anomalies suggests that the Australian Electoral Commission needs to become more vigilant in monitoring election donations and disclosures. In the 1997&hyphen;98 budget, the commission has been allocated $113 million. But the example of one Liberal minister and donations linked to him suggests that the Electoral Commission does not have adequate resources to perform the tasks assigned to it. As such, I think there is a need to allocate additional funding so that a more thorough check of company returns can be undertaken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to talk about the budget and its impact on the environment. The budget reveals clearly that the Liberal promise to use funds from the part&hyphen;sale of Telstra for extra spending on the environment has gone the way of dozens of Liberal promises before it. Not only has the one billion trees program been abandoned; so too has funding for the save the bush program. Furthermore, agencies whose work is critical to the ongoing protection of our environment are to have their budgets slashed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Heritage Commission has been cut from $11.7 million to $10.7 million. The Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service has been cut from $43.4 million to $35.9 million. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority has been cut from $12.8 million to $9.7 million. The Antarctic Divi
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sion has been cut from $60.7 million to $60.3 million. The administration budget for the Department of the Environment is down from $148 million to $129 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The situation is just as bad in the energy ministry, where Minister Parer has abolished the Energy Research and Development Corporation and slashed a further $11 million from the national energy efficiency program, which comes on top of a $3 million cut in last year's budget. This leaves Australia's dwindling credibility on greenhouse gas emission issues absolutely in tatters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's intentions are increasingly obvious. The environmental bonanza promised from the Telstra part&hyphen;sale will never eventuate. The Telstra money will be replacing programs and projects which Labor had already put in place. It is a fraud on those voters who care deeply for the environment and believed the Liberal rhetoric that they had finally changed their colours on the environment. It is a fraud on all Australians who hope and expect that money from the part&hyphen;sale of Telstra will be used on additional environmental protection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The one billion trees program, started under the federal Labor government in 1990, was a genuine community based effort to replenish some of the most degraded parts of the Australian environment. Greening Australia has been actively involved in this massive exercise, which has extended to local environmental projects such as Merri Creek and Moonee Ponds Creek in my own electorate. We have a government which promised that it would retain the one billion trees program but, with the election over, it now feels free to drop this obligation. Australians who thought this government had genuine environmental objectives have been conned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, we find the budget bringing broken promises and more hardship for public tenants, people needing prescriptions and parents needing child care. We see a $50 million cut in the Commonwealth&hyphen;state housing agreement, which will cause waiting lists to blow out, and the abolition of rental assistance for people in public housing, which will cost tenants $58 million in a full year. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS> </PARA>

The trip of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to China was an enormous success and you need only read such luminaries as Paul Kelly, who does not usually support the government, to see that our forays into foreign affairs in Asia have met with great success. By linking ourselves more closely with Asia, we are not doing so at the expense of our relationships with other world regions. On the contrary, by more closely identifying ourselves with our immediate region, we are opening up opportunities for improved and increased access to America through APEC.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Asia&hyphen;Europe Meeting is also an important development. Asian nations have for some time been outward looking. Singapore declared itself a global city back in the 1970s. ASEM will strengthen the third leg in the economic power triangle and promote greater stability throughout the world. Taking a role in ASEM would further our ties with Europe. It is to be hoped that our efforts to join that

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since coming to office the Prime Minister and his cabinet colleagues the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) and the Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer) have worked tirelessly to improve Australia's standing in our immediate geographical region. They have stressed that Asia is our top priority and that it will remain so in the long term. Thus far we have received backing for ASEM membership from, among others, Japan, Indonesia, Singapore and Thailand. Malaysia, however, perhaps still cautious from a run-in with our former Prime Minister, is still expressing some doubts and has vetoed our membership. Australia cannot afford to let misapprehensions linger. While our culture and heritage may still be predominantly western, our geography and our national interests demand that we commit ourselves to Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Along with trade, there is the omnipresent issue of defence. It goes without saying that trust between nations is a great step toward security. As increased trade will help stabilise the region further, so too will the continuing and growing exchange of students through university programs promote understanding and appreciation of different culture and custom. Backing our commitment to friendship and a shared peace are defence agreements with Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, our more traditional links with the United States and New Zealand, and other less formal arrangements with other Asian nations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The environment, to which the coalition has demonstrated its commitment by funding the biggest natural heritage projects in Australian history, is another winner from increased area cooperation. International borders have traditionally spelt trouble for the environment as nations have placed their own financial concerns above the environmental needs of others. But the new levels of dialogue will result in greater awareness of and less damage to our ecosystems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The groundwork done by this government will provide unimaginable gains in the medium to longer haul. To truly capitalise on these opportunities, we must be able to put our

Membership of an elite forum is an honour that entails responsibilities. We will be able to fully meet those only if our house is in good financial order. We cannot be, or afford to be seen as, the weak link in a powerful chain. It would seem that where independence was seen as an end goal, it is now the case that global interdependence is in vogue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia is still a young country, beset with teething problems that some others successfully negotiated a long time ago. Yet we are a nation of unbounded potential and we are beginning to realise it. The way we have been and the way we have viewed ourselves has changed down through the years since white settlement, jerked in one direction or another by unifying or divisive events that have marked our history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The way we look at others has similarly changed. It was not so long ago that official government policy encouraged a homogenous society. Today we better reflect the world around us. Australia is the most successful immigrant nation on earth&mdash;and I know that the member for Calwell at least agrees with that. As we have embraced the waves of newcomers to our shores, our diversity has become a positive rather than a negative. As we continue to grow and diversify, so will we continue to change and mature as a nation. That is not to say that we must surrender any of our sovereign rights as a nation, but rather become an integral piece of a larger puzzle. Mutual understanding and cooperation between Australia and our regional neighbours is a necessity and quite possibly, in time, an inevitability. In any case, it is most definitely the formula for our future prosperity.</PARA>

For the second budget in a row the government has failed to address the issue of unemployment and is content to abrogate its responsibility in this area. Whether it be through the massive cuts to the Public Service or through the massive cuts to industry assistance or through the destruction of labour market programs, the government has shown that it is not interested in tackling this massive problem. Its own budget forecasts on unemployment and its refusal to set a target for the reduction of unemployment are sad indictments of its performance in this area.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the budget in August of last year, the Treasurer (Mr Costello) predicted that unemployment would go to 8.25 per cent by the end of the financial year. Soon after, he was moved to amend that prediction to 8.5 per cent. But even that prediction, which is only about three or four months old, is out. At the end of the financial year, unemployment will reach about 8.7 per cent. In this budget, what is unemployment predicted to drop to? It is predicted to drop to eight per cent. Even if this figure of eight per cent is achieved, it is a totally unacceptable figure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To further complicate the situation, the proposed brave new world of privatised employment assistance has been delayed due to the incompetence of the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) in policy administration. Even awaiting a flawed policy has resulted in a huge amount of uncertainty for those involved in or seeking to be involved in employment service provision and, more importantly, for the hundreds of thousands of unemployed Australians. To add insult to injury, the minister then threatens to bypass the parliament and implement her regime by regulation. The sorry handling of this episode reflects the fact that dealing with unemployment is just not a priority for this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget contains some hidden nasties which will have a significant impact on some constituents in my electorate. I speak of the abolition of the family resource centre program in this budget, a decision I believe to be shortsighted and regressive. This mean&hyphen;spirited decision was taken arbitrarily, without any consultation. It was taken when, as far as I am aware, all published evaluations of the FRC program have underscored the considerable benefits that these centres have brought to the communities that they service. For instance, a 1994 post&hyphen;implementation review undertaken by an independent consultant, Purdon and Associate, found:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the FRC Program has been implemented successfully and is operating efficiently . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The decision reveals the total sham of this government's claim to budget honesty. Where in the budget and budget related papers does it say that family resource centres are to
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4721"> close? Well, the answer is nowhere&mdash;not a word. This decision is cloaked in secrecy. Under the innocuous heading `Broadbanding of family services' one finds the following sentence:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Savings will be achieved by refocusing some projects and programs from 1 January 1998.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Believe it or not, this means the abolition of a $4.7 million program involving 11 family resource centres across Australia&mdash;a decision not highlighted. This is not budget honesty. It is a farrago of deception and incompetence. In part, the decision has implications that redefine the role of the federal government in the provision of services to families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One thing must be clear: under no circumstances can the transfer of some of the funds to direct family services at youth activity centres be considered a replacement for the work of the family resource centres. This is the excuse that is being given to those that have taken an interest in this subject since the budget&mdash;I might say, people who only learnt of the decision a couple of days after the budget after great investigation. If a case can be made for the federal government to get into the provision of direct services to families, something that since the late 1980s has been done by the states exclusively, then it should be funded by a separate appropriation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the rationale for this leap into the dark of direct service provision? If you ask the association of services supporting Australia's families, they do not know. In fact, they have asked this incompetent minister: where is the policy development behind the decision? One would also like to ask: how will the new family support networks in youth activity support centres operate? How will they relate to family support services already funded by state and territory government? There are no answers because there is no policy rationale. This is a government flying blind, attempting to cloak a cut to services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Family resource centres were created by the former Labor government to address issues of social justice, including social justice on the fringes of major cities. Social justice might be an unfashionable concept in the Howard government, but the issues have not gone away.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Since its inception in 1992, the Whittlesea Plenty Valley Family Resource Centre, located in Thomastown in the electorate of Scullin, has played a crucial role in enhancing services to the public and families by supporting service providers and community groups. The key word is `enhancing'. It has helped many groups to help themselves. I thought that was something this government thought highly of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the years, the family resource centre has assisted literally hundreds of local community groups with information, coordination, training and support. Through those groups it has helped thousands of people&mdash;within their families and as individuals. Last year, for example, the family resource centre provided desktop publishing assistance to 100 local community groups and agencies; updated and distributed in eight community languages a comprehensive community directory; and published a young people's services information card and distributed it to all people of secondary school age. This card was launched by a Liberal backbencher, representing the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan), who, at the very time of the launch of this important service for young people, was putting a red line through the whole program. What unbelievable hypocrisy!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year, the local family resource centre interviewed and placed over 150 volunteers&mdash;not unemployed people dragooned by a punitive government, but actual volunteers. The FRC facilitated the provision of 12 major training sessions for local agencies on topics such as good employment practices, multicultural awareness, parent education, children's services, human resource management, competitive tendering and changes to family law. The beneficiaries of this training are community based agencies and groups who otherwise would not have had access to this type of training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the Victorian context, that sort of training for community groups is becoming all the more important. Because of the actions of the federal government and the continuing actions over the past five years of the Kennett state government, community organisations are having to do more and more to assist within the communities that they represent. Whether
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4722"> it be schools or community services, much more emphasis is being placed on the ability of community agencies to manage things themselves. In an area like the City of Whittlesea, like other areas in the Plenty Valley growth corridor, the people involved in the committees of management of these agencies need assistance. They need a helping hand. What the family resource centres have done is maximise the effort of these community agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The family resource centre has assisted over 20 groups with submissions for government funding. The bottom line is that most of these things will not be done after the family resource centre has gone. Its loss will be keenly felt in an area of considerable disadvantage. The reality is that community based organisations and community groups do not have the financial scope to do for themselves the things that were possible through the family resource centre.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The decision to abolish family resource centres has revealed a minister well out of her depth, an incompetent minister. In addition, it reveals something far more sinister about where the government is drawing policy ideas from. The family resource centres rate a mention in that ambivalent document&mdash;the report of the National Commission of Audit. They are mentioned as one of the programs in the Department of Health and Family Services which, it is claimed, duplicates state delivered services and therefore is something that the Commonwealth should not spend money on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the report of the National Commission of Audit was released, it appeared to be buried very quickly. The government appeared not to rely on it much and made little mention of it. At the time, it was stated that there was to be no formal government response to the National Commission of Audit's report. There does not need to be a formal response because the government's response has been to implement the recommendations of the National Commission of Audit by stealth over the last two budgets. As it was with the government's whole policy on child care, the decision to defund the family re
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> source centre comes right out of the National Commission of Audit's report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real problem is that, in doing that, the added excuse or the alternative offered for the funds that are being removed from the family resource centre&mdash;that is, expanded direct service provision&mdash;flies in the face of other things that the National Commission of Audit has been indicating. In fact, the National Commission of Audit's report overlooks that what was promised in the area akin to family resource centres, especially in Victoria, never materialised. Whilst there was a promise to implement a program that would have supported community agencies, it never materialised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not content with defunding important programs which provide practical support, the government then perpetrated a great hoax on the Australian public with its savings tax rebate. This scheme is a scheme in every sense of the word. It breaks the coalition's promise to deliver the government superannuation contribution. This is a promise which, despite all its protestations, was one which was fairly and squarely taken on board by the present government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It replaces the superannuation contribution with a pathetic substitute which will do nothing towards improving national savings. One only has to look at the front page article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> today which quotes the Secretary to the Treasury. When asked whether the $2 billion cost to the government could exceed any increase in saving by individuals, Mr Evans told the committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yes, there is that risk.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The article goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">He answered "yes" to questions that the rebate could be obtained in full by taxpayers who had not increased their savings, or had reduced their savings in any given financial year, and said it might trigger higher savings only by small numbers of taxpayers.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The government should rely on the Treasury advice that it was getting about this scheme. I remind the House that, on the day after the budget was brought down, when the Treasurer was asked what the Treasury's advice was about whether the scheme would boost na
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4723"> tional savings, the Treasurer told this chamber:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What the Treasury policy is doesn't matter to the Government.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is an indication that the Treasury advice was overlooked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said, the government only had to look at the lack of success of policy initiatives similar to this tax savings scheme overseas. In a 1995 OECD report, when they reviewed the success or otherwise of tax exempt saving policies in its 24-member countries, the OECD found:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there is no clear evidence that the level of taxation, along with other factors that affect the rate of return, significantly affects the level of household saving.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Despite this, the government has put in place this scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unless somebody has done adequate research and would like to accuse me of some form of hypocrisy, I will come clean with the chamber tonight. Back in 1991 in a private member's debate and earlier in an appropriation debate, I indicated that I supported investigation of a scheme modelled on the British Tessa scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The attraction to that scheme in policy terms at the time was that it was a new scheme that, in part, promised to be targeted to people with smaller savings. It had the attraction of encouraging people with small amounts of savings to be part of a wider scheme. But it was also proposed before the major reforms that were made to occupational superannuation in this country&mdash;before the major superannuation policy reforms that the Labor governments made. It ought to be remembered that the superannuation reforms of the Labor governments had a dual purpose&mdash;not only to ensure that in retirement the workers of Australia could sufficiently cover their income support in retirement, but a device to boost the level of national savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The thing that has characterised this debate is the cries that we hear from those people opposite that in some way the value of the things that were proposed to be done in superannuation were going to take too long. We heard the cry, `Oh, yes, but the benefits are 20 or 30 years out.' I say to those who
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> put that case that that is the point. Australia as a nation has to realise that the things that we have to do today to address not only an individual's ability to cover themselves in their retirement but also the ability of Australia as a nation to build a proper national savings pool are long-term policies. They are policies where we have to make hard decisions now and where we will probably only see the effect in a number of years. There is no short&hyphen;term fix.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New Statesman </EMPHASIS>on 31 January 1997, an article critical of schemes like Tessa in Britain, was under the banner line:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite tax inducements, Britons still aren't saving for their old age.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Here is the crunch:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Soon they will have to be coerced, unless they can first be re&hyphen;educated.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The thing that this article indicates that is required&mdash;it is something that in this debate within Australia we ought to return to and ought to understand&mdash;is that there either has to be compulsion or a change in the cultural thinking about superannuation and savings. Gimmicky schemes like the savings tax rebate will not do anything. They are a gimmick, there is no proof that they will increase the national savings pool and, in fact, they are not directed in the most equitable fashion. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, you and I both know the member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins)  reasonably well through our committee work. He must have agonised over giving that speech because he is a very decent man, from all my contact with him. I notice that he stayed away from a lot of the familiar Labor lines, and I respect him for that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition's second budget is a plan for Australia that has four key aims: creating the conditions for real jobs growth, helping families save, encouraging small businesses to invest and expand, and ensuring Australia pays its way again. I described last year's August budget as the foundation stone for a better future for all Australians. This year's 13 May budget could be described as the first layer of building blocks.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4724">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Within a three&hyphen;year parliamentary term, the coalition intends to turn what was a $10.3 billion underlying Labor deficit into a $1.6 billion surplus. These figures have real meaning to the people of Dunkley. They mean lower interest rates, which means money back in the pockets of every resident who has a housing or car loan, anyone who has borrowed to invest, anyone who has a Visa card bill and all businesses that rely on finance to employ people in the production of goods and services. We as a nation can again proudly proclaim that we are paying our way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Already since the budget we have seen the Reserve Bank decrease the cost of money by another half a per cent. As the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) pointed out, this brings the total gain for a home owner with a $100,000 mortgage to $292 of after tax money a month since the coalition was elected 15 months ago. It is not often that people receive a bonus pay rise of $75 a week because of the government's good performance, but this is what has happened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most important reaction to the budget is from people who create jobs, because increasing the number of job opportunities is the key and very positive payback for the citizens of Dunkley. A major focus over the next year will be to build upon the results of the coalition's first 12 months, which in Frankston and Mornington has seen 900 fewer people receiving income support through unemployment than was the case a year ago. Those who seek to oppose the work of the government and myself to grow job opportunities, to encourage small business and to encourage investment in the local area denigrate the numerous positive employment signs there are in the Dunkley community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What do those opposite offer? They are saying, `Let's go back to the good old days&mdash;you know, the ones we couldn't afford. The ones where the Bankcard was run dry, and then some.' That is their offer. They are the conditions that created the problem we have today, yet all we get from those opposite is, `We need to go back to them.' What an extraordinary admission that they have no idea how to solve the problems that they have
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> created. Instead, it is left to the coalition to deal with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was delighted to see the Institute of Chartered Accountants, whose members advise many Dunkley businesses, say in their account of the budget:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very encouraged by the positive response from the member for Scullin. Allan Handberg of the Australian Chamber of Manufactures commented that the budget measures would lift small business and rightly suggested that small business certainly got a greater share of the spotlight and an abnormally high level of focus. The Reserve Bank Governor, Ian Macfarlane, has already predicted that economic growth this coming financial year will be four per cent above the budget's forecast. I will be happy if this turns out to be the case because growth of this amount in a low inflation, low interest rate environment means more jobs and wealth for the people of Dunkley.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4725">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Could I remind the House that the coalition's achievements are in stark contrast to what happened under Labor. We are paying our way. We are not peddling irresponsible spending. We are not harking back to those nostalgic thoughts and wonderful policies that created the problem in the first place. We are actually getting on with the job. Those opposite tell us, `But we would've spent more money on this and we would've spent more money on that.' In the last six years of office, those opposite racked up $75 billion in debt but created only 7,100 permanent jobs. It does not take a genius to work out the price of each of those jobs, and over there they somehow think that is a proud  achievement. Pity them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The headline grabbing centrepiece of the budget is the savings initiative. Unlike what the member for Scullin said would happen under the l&hyphen;a&hyphen;w law tax cuts and then the superannuation co&hyphen;contribution&mdash;that movable feast that they never really got around to delivering, the one where, for the benefits they were talking about, the Labor Party's hand would have been in your wallet again to get a piece of the action&mdash;we have introduced a savings initiative. Paddy McGuinness notes in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it . . . represents the very first time an Australian government has financially recognised the desirability of encouraging small individual savings and looks forward from the present necessity of government savings by way of a fiscal surplus . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">More encouraging news. The savings tax rebate of 15c in the dollar is attractive. The Labor Party is spreading the lie that people need to have $60,000 in the bank earning interest at a rate of five per cent to claim the maximum $450 rebate. Wrong, those opposite&mdash;wrong! This is incorrect. Not only does the qualifying income from savings include interest income from dividends, rent, capital gains, private pensions and annuities as well as income from partnerships, businesses and trusts; it does include income from bank accounts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As well as this wide range of income, the rebate is also available for people's own contributions to superannuation schemes&mdash;contributions they would make as their decision, not with your help by having your hand
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in their wallets. I think that is a reasonable way to go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The thing that also contrasts this initiative with the Labor Party proposal is that people who actually need it most get a benefit, whereas under Labor the top end of the town, those whom they keep saying they detest&mdash;I think the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) said in a contribution one day that he thought they needed a good spanking&mdash;was rewarded most with their initiatives. What we have done is actually target it to everybody who is making a contribution to national savings&mdash;a vivid contrast once again. As economist Ross Gittins points out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . this additional dimension to the savings tax rebate will be a boon to the many people who already make their own contributions either to their employer's super scheme or a scheme they've organised themselves through their bank or life office . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Because low income earners on up to $31,000 a year are already eligible for a tax rebate of 10c in the dollar on superannuation contributions up to $1,000, they will get a 25 per cent bonus for the first $1,000 of super. It is a wonderful initiative. Isn't that a contrast to what those opposite were offering? They were going to say, `We'll give you a bit and you can have it back some 40 years down the track'&mdash;that is what would have happened under their model&mdash;`but we just have to let you know that it'll be our hand in your wallet.' So when people go home and wonder why they cannot quite afford to make that extra little payment on their Visa card or why their kids cannot quite have what they are after, they can thank the Labor Party for having their hand in their wallet once again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Research by Bankers Trust demonstrates that the savings rebate will clearly benefit low income earners. People earning less than $40,000 a year hold nearly $4 out of every $5 which the saving rebate covers.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="THEOPHANOUS" NAMEID="QJ4">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1K6">Mr BILLSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate that the member opposite who is at the desk is catching on to what a wonderful initiative this is. Bankers Trust suggests that the two lowest income groups, earning up to $20,000, are
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4726"> clearly the greatest proportionate  beneficiaries. This is great news for the people of Dunkley. I am waiting for an interjection. It is great news, isn't it? And we pause to take it in. It is fantastic news.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 15c in the dollar rebate will also benefit the people who retire and take either an annuity or a lump sum. Labor's hate for self-funded retirees again manifests itself in their opposition to this proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might mention that the government's specific provision in the budget to fund pension increases by the new benchmark of 25 per cent of average male weekly earnings is another great contribution to stability, certainty and security for elderly Australians. Labor promised us that they had this funded but, when we look through the forward estimates, those same estimates they could not fund anyway, we find there was no provision for this. Isn't that a disgrace? What a terrible trick to play on the elderly members of my community. I am glad that we have rectified that&mdash;again, another oversight by the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Creating the conditions for more jobs is the key government aim. A properly educated work force is essential. This is why I found the accent of the budget on providing $159 million to literacy and numeracy so refreshing. Australia's 10,000 schools will share $152 million to help primary school children to read and write adequately. The coalition's jobs pathway program will be expanded, with $20 million a year being provided. I note the good work of the Peninsula Institute of TAFE, which have already nearly met their target of 60 positions for school leavers from last year's smaller initial program. I certainly welcome the contribution from my former secondary college at Monterey and in Frankston North because they see that this is just the sort of program to help their community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) has secured the agreement of all states that children should be adequately literate and numerate by grade 3. If we can achieve this, the result will be an Australia that is more competitive against the rest of the world. This is the best way to ensure that the people in
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Dunkley continue to enjoy more opportunities. It is terrible that after 13 years of Labor governments almost one in three 14&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds in year 9 did not have adequate literacy and numeracy skills. Just disgraceful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the next four years government schools will receive $2.3 billion more in funding from the federal coalition government. Real funding per government school student will increase by 17 per cent. For non&hyphen;government school students, the increase per head will be 14 per cent. This gives the lie to disgraceful claims by a Democrat senator that the government is neglecting government school students. Nothing is further from the truth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For tertiary students at Monash Peninsula, the introduction of a 25 per cent discount for up&hyphen;front payment of higher education contributions will prove beneficial. Taxpayers are still paying up to three&hyphen;quarters of the cost of a university education for each local student, but the government is keen to make it easier for students to pay off their interest&hyphen;free loans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Monash Peninsula inform me that their enrolment figures met their targets for this year. On an equivalent full-time basis, they have 2,650 students studying at the always improving McMahons Road campus this year. In education, one of their main faculties, I understand both the entrance scores and enrolments increased. In nursing and in computing, the story was the same. In business and the relatively small course of art and design they run with the Monash Caulfield campus, there was little change. So much for Labor's lies and scare tactics about students deserting university because of changes to the HECS system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I alluded to above, many Dunkley residents are elderly. I am pleased that organisations like Alzheimers Australia have publicly welcomed the government's plan for people with dementia and for their carers. The increase in the domiciliary nursing care benefit and an extension to 63 days a year of respite care before allowances paid to carers are affected are both welcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Anne-Marie Mioche from the Carers Association of Australia said, the changes to
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4727"> the child disability allowance would help to ensure that this taxpayer funded benefit goes to the carers with the most disabled children, those who need it most. The domiciliary nursing benefit paid to the carers of people who need nursing home care will also be increased by $16.60 a fortnight. I have a particular interest in the area of caring for intellectually disabled young people as they go through their maturing years, and I believe we need to focus more attention on that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a budget about people. It is about the right conditions to improve the lot of the home buyers, the car buyers, the aged, those with additional care needs, families with children and job generators such as Dunkley's small businesses. I think it is a terrific budget. I encourage those opposite to acquaint themselves with the very constructive measures that are in it.

It is about security in times of sickness and old age. It is about personal security from violence to the person and from attack on property. It is about national security. It is not an Australian community that is relaxed and comfortable, as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) would have it. It is a community that has real fears. It is a community where the apparent permanence of continuing high levels of unemployment contribute to high levels of insecurity. It is a community that has very deep-seated frustrations about a government that cannot see the sense of support and encouragement for Australian industry.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are dealing with a situation of slow economic growth that is forecast downwards to 3&frac14; per cent this financial year. Despite a healthy world economy estimated to be growing at about 5.5 per cent and despite housing recoveries, the fact is that Australia's economic growth rates are simply unacceptably low. It is worth noting, however, that not all Australians are experiencing low economic growth. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS>'s rich list just recently published shows that the top 200 Australians in the last year experienced 10 per cent growth in their incomes, three times that of the growth rate of the economy as a whole. Even the Reserve Bank Governor recognises that the economy can sustain a four per cent growth rate without developing inflationary problems. That is the sort of growth rate regularly and consistently achieved by Labor governments. Without that growth, unemployment will simply stay unacceptably high into the next century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does the government do in response to this? It mouths off about industrial relations. That is not very convincing from the point of view of the work force. It has got an absolutely fraudulent work for the dole scheme that is not going to create a single additional real job. We have the federation slush fund as a method of providing some government input into the economy. But that of course is not going to create any jobs until at least July 1998. So this is a government that is doing nothing about the most substantial concerns of Australians: jobs and job security.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's performance on jobs is a bit like a rather corny movie I saw a while back called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Flatliners</EMPHASIS>. It is simply dead flat.

Since the coalition has been in office, there are some 31,500, in absolute numbers, additional unemployed people and 44,000 additional long-term unemployed people. In my part of Melbourne, the outer west, there is 11.2 per cent unemployment. That is several points higher than the national and state averages.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year the government axed a range of government programs, job schemes, skills programs and industry programs, including very important ones in the research and development area, and there were cuts to export market development grants. Now more of those sorts of cuts have come. We heard the member for Dunkley talking about quarantining. There is not much point quarantining dead animals, and many of the government's industry support programs are dead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have got cuts to vocational education&mdash;something like $250 million in the last two years. Apprenticeships are down. We have seen the attacks on tertiary education, particularly its fairness and equity, when it is recognised that human capital is really the core to a successful, modern, competitive Australian economy in the future. We have seen $280 million cut out of child care, thereby attacking the capacity of many families to really work in our economy. It is no wonder that people are insecure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not just the young who experience these issues. Increasingly and tragically many people in their forties and fifties are facing the reality that, with the sort of abysmally low economic growth rates which this government is overseeing, there are no real prospects in many cases for them working into the future. We have a government that sits idly by, on the best interpretation; on the worst interpretation, it is contributing further to the problem. There are 20,000 more jobs to go from Telstra and an additional 8,000 Defence jobs to go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a government that dithers on the car industry. We have a government that apparently cannot see that we do have the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> basis for a competitive, quality, export&hyphen;oriented car industry in Australia, an industry that needs cooperative relations with government in order to continue to invest in Australia and provide a core for Australian manufacturing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I indicated in a speech not that long ago, there are plenty of places for companies to invest. For example, earlier this year General Motors commenced construction of a $750 million plant for the production of Opel vehicles in Thailand. What is required is genuine commitment and support for important industries that underpin our manufacturing capacity. We have a government that simply dithers on that at present.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have an important debate to come up in the near future on the textiles, clothing and footwear industry, a $10 billion Australian industry which generates $1 billion in exports. Companies such as Bradmill in the western suburbs of Melbourne say, `Important components of industry support schemes'&mdash;the import credit scheme&mdash;`have allowed us to commit millions of dollars to our position as an important Australian manufacturer.' The downgrading of the import credit scheme and its eventual abolition is affecting them right now. They are facing the end of their ability to continue at the same scale and to imagine further growth here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is just one example of a government that is sitting idly by when crucial decisions about manufacturing jobs and manufacturing industry in this country are on the line.

<PARA STYLE="Para">It is very clear in press reports that a whole range of countries, including the United States, continue to heavily protect their industry by means that Australia does not: through non&hyphen;tariff barriers such as quotas. It
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4729"> is quite clear that those countries, like Australia, do not intend to engage in unilateral disarmament in important areas of our manufacturing industry. It is no wonder that many Australians feel intense insecurity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Financial insecurity is a matter on many people's minds when they look at the government scrapping the superannuation contribution policy. It is a huge blow to many individuals in their longer term prospects in retirement, as well as a huge blow to real national savings. A young worker in his mid&hyphen;thirties on average weekly earnings is going to be $110,000 worse off when he eventually retires as a result of the government scrapping the policy which the Labor Party had in place. We all agree with the fundamental importance of national savings. Something like $400 billion over the next few decades&mdash;the three per cent worker superannuation plan, plus the matching contributions&mdash;is going to be forgone for some mickey mouse scheme that the government has dreamed up, primarily to benefit people who are saving already. No wonder there is cynicism about and an increased sense of financial insecurity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When it comes to security in old age and sickness, if you are rich and healthy enough to defer the age pension, just maybe you will get a bit of help from the government. If you are rich enough, you can have the best medicine; if you are not, you get it on the cheap. We have a government that, in the last budget, cut $500 million from the pharmaceutical benefits list, another $700 million in this hit and a number of medicines coming off, notably medicines for stomach problems, muscle pains, diarrhoea and anti&hyphen;fungal medicines. If you are rich enough, you can get into a nursing home without selling your house. Hospital waiting lists continue to get longer and facilities continue to deteriorate for our aged and our ill. We have the minister bleating about that being the responsibility of the states. We all know that there are plenty of policy initiatives that can be taken from the Commonwealth to address the fiscal shifting that states may be tempted to do. But this government simply wants to bleat; it does not want to address the problem.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Personal security was referred to. It is self&hyphen;evident that if you are in a society with young people without hope, where there is intense pressure on families, that you are going to produce all sorts of social dysfunction which, in turn, produces crime and violence. That social dysfunction perhaps most starkly can be seen with the drugs problem that many commentators see is inundating Australian society. We had President Clinton in this very chamber towards the end of last year referring to the intense seriousness of this problem in societies like Australia and the need for extraordinarily strong and concerted action. Just the other day the chairman of the Commonwealth Law Enforcement Board said that the drugs trade was comparable in scale to the international oil trade. It is certainly a trade that underpins much crime. It is a trade that does not respond simply to law enforcement measures. Obviously, our society needs to attack drug use and the problems that it generates, including crime on a multifaceted basis. It is a health problem and there is a range of social issues. But it certainly demands a law enforcement response as well as part of that strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does this budget achieve? It achieves a cut in the Australian Federal Police budget from $250 million to $238 million; a cut in the Australian Customs Service budget from $386 million to $367 million; a cut in the AUSTRAC budget&mdash;a small but increasingly vital law enforcement agency, vital because of the role it plays in tracking the money trail, particularly internationally, and Australia is a leading edge international player in that area&mdash;from $8.3 million to $7.8 million; and a cut in the Director of Public Prosecution's budget from $58 million to $53 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the spirit of generosity, I suppose I should acknowledge that there has been a small increase in some sections of the budget of the National Crime Authority, but there are still substantial problems in that organisation that I as a member of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, along with government members, am aware of. Out of respect for the importance of the operations of that organisation, it is not appropriate to detail in a public situation some of the areas
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4730"> of operation that do not continue now because of resource problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But if the minister at the table&mdash;the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp)&mdash;cared to have a discussion with coalition members of that committee, he would find out very quickly that, taken together with the budget cuts to the Federal Police, the Customs Service and AUSTRAC, there have to be very serious doubts raised about how serious this government is in making a significant contribution to people's personal safety&mdash;the safety of people from violence, the safety of people from drugs and the safety of people's personal property. Given the priorities and the cutbacks it is overseeing in key budget areas, we have to doubt the government's seriousness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the list of security issues that concerned people, I referred to national security. I guess nothing is more important in the longer term in that respect than the way in which we conduct our foreign policy and the image this country projects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What have we seen from this government? We have seen all the wrong messages being communicated. We have seen cutbacks to Radio Australia and its vital services in terms of communicating an image of Australia within our region. We have seen the Prime Minister's failure to lead on crucial issues that relate to race, particularly Asian immigration. And we have seen the reinforcement of stereotypes that are extraordinarily unhelpful to Australia within our region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen a government that has presided over 10 per cent cuts to overseas aid. We have seen a government that has axed the DIFF scheme. We have seen a government generating unnecessary tensions in its relations with China and then proceeding to undergo the prime ministerial kowtow, a most embarrassing spectacle. We have seen the abysmal failure of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) in trying to gain a seat on the UN Security Council. We have seen the collapse of the Australian&hyphen;European Union framework agreement negotiations. And the list goes on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the area of defence, the government does not seem to understand the vital importance
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to this nation's security of a range of fundamental industries and the support those industries need, particularly industries such as heavy engineering and shipbuilding. I simply do not believe&mdash;and I do not think anyone in the industry believes&mdash;the government's position in relation to the future of ADI and the future of shareholdings in the Australian Submarine Corporation. There really has been a failure on the part of this government to have a vision and a depth of vision about this country's position in the world. That is most alarming for all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I come back to my starting point. This is a government, to use the member for Dunkley's building blocks analogy, which is pretty badly flawed. If it tries to put the building up with these building blocks, it is going to fall down pretty quick. It is a government that does not fundamentally address the key security issues&mdash;the issues of job security, financial security, security in old age and sickness, security from personal assault and crime and national security. Those areas of concern, I believe, are the most fundamental things on the minds of Australians at the present time.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with great pleasure that I rise to support the second budget of the Howard&hyphen;Fischer government. I would like to commence my speech by referring to a speech I gave in a grievance debate in March this year about self-funded retirees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members who graciously listened to that speech will recollect that approximately one million people or about seven per cent of our population finance all or part of their retirement. As our population ages, it is now calculated that the number of Australians over 65 will increase from 12 per cent to 20 per cent by the year 2030.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, I cannot give a more precise figure because no government has ever instructed the Australian Bureau of Statistics to record or analyse data on self-funded retirees. After years of neglect, it would be appropriate and very constructive if the Australian Bureau of Statistics considered the necessary steps to have information about self-funded retirees recorded. The creation of an accurate database
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4731"> would be the first step on the road to helping self-funded retirees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More importantly, however, self-funded retirees would like the government to consider allocating a minister to be responsible for the affairs of self-funded retirees. I make no apologies for reminding my colleagues that groups such as Aboriginals, pensioners and small business owners have ministers to oversee their affairs. These ministers actively make submissions to cabinet and go into battle for their stakeholders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Self-funded retirees are Australians. They are Australians who have budgeted, they are Australians who have saved and they are Australians who have planned for their retirement. Self-funded retirees are an asset to our country. They have invested their hard&hyphen;won capital in Australia and assisted in the country's development, yet they have no minister to support them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Self-funded retirees need to be encouraged. It is unfortunate that there is a perception in the community and by some members in this place that, if you are not a pensioner, you have bucket loads of money. A classic example is the Labor Party's tawdry attempt to means test the government's new savings tax cut. If Labor had had their way, self-funded retirees would have missed out again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The federal government's new tax cut on savings is worth up to $450 a year for self-funded retirees. For years under Labor, there was no incentive to save. Labor actually penalised us for saving by taxing our interest. But the coalition's new tax cut on savings means that all of us, including self&hyphen;funded retirees, will be eligible for a tax rebate on up to $3,000 of savings interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, self&hyphen;funded retirees will be able to claim a rebate on personal superannuation contributions, which will be a real benefit if they are living on the returns from their savings. However, more needs to be done for this group, particularly in the area of health care. The government's private health insurance rebate is a step in the right direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I mentioned before, the self&hyphen;funded retirees are a group of elderly Australians who should be rewarded for all they have done for
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this country. One of the reasons Australia is such a wonderful country is that there is an ethic that people are entitled to a fair go. We must now ask ourselves why a section of the population who have put aside investments to finance their retirement have not been getting a fair go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to focus the House's attention on another group of people whose work is unheralded and unsung: Australia's carers, who look after the sick, the disabled and the elderly. Carers enable people to stay in their homes where they might otherwise have to live in a hospital, a hospice, a nursing home or another type of institution. In August 1996 the government committed itself to the specific recognition of the efforts, needs and role carers play in the community. As a government we have committed $36.7 million to implement the national respite for carers program. The support for carers is something that is very close to my heart and further recognition of their work is my personal highlight in the 1997&hyphen;98 budget. I am proud to have been a member of the government introducing these reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1997&hyphen;98 budget will fund carer resource centres and a regional network of carer respite centres to the tune of $7 million. Carer resource centres will offer carers advice, counselling and valuable information services such as education programs. A major budget initiative includes a $20 million per year increase in the rate of domiciliary nursing care benefit. As a result, the domiciliary nursing care benefit will increase by $16.60 to $74.90 a fortnight from July next year. This change will bring it into line with the child care disability allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The carers package also addresses a number of inadequacies in the current income support arrangements for carers. I am delighted that, for the first time, people caring for a disabled child under the age of 16 will be eligible for a carers payment. Also from next July carers will be allowed 63 days respite&mdash;up from 52&mdash;for their caring duties before their benefits are affected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A special program is being set up for carers of people afflicted with dementia. It recognises dementia as a progressive and long&hyphen;term
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4732"> disease and that carers need special assessment, education and support. A $2.3 million program will be provided each year for the needs of the dementia sufferers and their carers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will also extend the newstart allowance activity test exemption for temporary carers beyond the current 13 weeks in special circumstances. This increases the scope for the unemployed to provide care without losing their payments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It can be seen that the government is showing genuine compassion and concern for carers. As a government we have recognised, in a practical and tangible way, carers' needs, carers' problems and the importance of ongoing support. It is with great pleasure that I commend the present budget to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Contrary to the claim of the member for Lilley (Mrs Elizabeth Grace), I wish to draw to the House's attention tonight the fact that this has been a small&hyphen;minded budget by a small&hyphen;minded government. It is a government bereft of vision and bereft of ideas. It is a government which has failed again with this year's budget to provide both hope and security for Australia's battlers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me turn now to the budget in some detail. If Australian industry thought that the government may have taken the opportunity presented to it by this year's budget to make amends for the detrimental policies it has pursued over the last 12 months or so then they are sadly mistaken. Even in the light of the horrendous news of the BHP closures, the government refuses to see the error of its ways. Last year the federal government ripped $2.9 billion out of industry assistance programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This year the budget contains nothing better for Australian industry than a slowdown in these cuts. There is no suggestion of a reversal of the cuts that were imposed last year. Instead we are presented with another massive projected decline in assistance to our manufacturing industry. It is a decline which Treasury officials justify as `a move in government policy away from sector specific assistance'. Specifically, the Howard government's policies will result in a decline from
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> $561 million to $146 million in assistance to manufacturing between 1997&hyphen;98 and 2000&hyphen;01. Furthermore, it will result in a decline over the same period by some $26 million in assistance to exporters. And, of course, R&amp;D assistance will be half a billion dollars less than it was when Labor was in government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What little good there is in this budget for industry are some measures which had already been announced. These are measures which the government was forced by Labor to accept, albeit reluctantly, as we fought here and in the Senate to save what we could of our highly successful industry support programs, which the government was hell&hyphen;bent on destroying. These include the partial extension of the ships bounty and some additional funding for R&amp;D projects. Unfortunately, these measures pale into insignificance when compared to the $2.9 billion worth of cuts imposed last year and, indeed, the further cuts this year, which include a 40 per cent cut to assistance to the pharmaceutical industry and the abolition of the Commonwealth industry places scheme, worth some $67 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government boasted in the election campaign that it would create 200,000 new manufacturing jobs by the year 2000. The reality is that, with devastating cuts to programs that produced real benefits for industry and the Australian economy and with the hands off rational approach that allows BHP to fold some of its major operations&mdash;and dependent upon the government's response to the Productivity Commission's disastrous recommendations for the motor industry&mdash;this government will soon be looking at a massive loss of jobs in our manufacturing sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I examine a little more closely the whole notion of the outlook for jobs under this budget, I would like to stress the importance of this issue by quoting Envoy Derek Linsell from the Salvation Army in Cranbourne in my electorate of Isaacs. His recent comments on the topic of unemployment appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cranbourne Independent</EMPHASIS> newspaper. Envoy Linsell said that unemployment was immoral. He said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4733">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Being unemployed rips the heart and soul out of people.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The problem is that rather than two per cent or three per cent being considered an acceptable level of unemployment in the country, we seem to have settled on nine per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It's just not acceptable as a way of life. Unemployment is just tragic.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Those of us on this side of the House would agree wholeheartedly with Derek Linsell's comments. We therefore despair at the government's lack of acknowledgment of the depth of our unemployment problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Labor left office we had an unemployment rate of around eight per cent which was trending down. In the past 15 months, since this government took office, the rate has been trending up. I wish to score no particular political point in saying that unemployment is too high, except to make the House aware of that trend.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another point I would like to make on this jobs question is that there is no hope for jobs in this year's budget. Predictions of growth are far too low. Education and training programs have been absolutely slashed, and there will be further cutbacks in public sector employment. If I could look at those aspects in somewhat more detail, the government's forecast of economic growth at 3.75 per cent is far too low to make inroads into unemployment. It is generally accepted that a level of at least four per cent is needed to have any impact on the jobless figures. This year's budget forecasts a drop in unemployment to only eight per cent over the course of 1997&hyphen;98. This must be taken with more than a grain of salt when we consider that last year the government predicted 8.25 per cent unemployment, and yet it rose to 8.5 per cent&mdash;15,000 fewer jobs than the government had forecast.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year $1.8 billion was cut from vital labour market programs. In this year's budget we see a further cut of $30 million. Despite the attempts of the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp)&mdash;I am pleased to see him in the House this evening&mdash;to portray the government as providing $265 million for 100,000 new
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> apprenticeships and traineeships in 1997&hyphen;98, funds for vocational education and training have in fact been cut and not increased. A sum of $72 million will be cut from vocational education and training grants to the states, adding to the $183 million cut from last year's budget. At least another 16,500 public service jobs will be lost in 1997&hyphen;98. Approximately three&hyphen;quarters of those job losses will be outside Canberra. The follow&hyphen;on effect of those public sector job losses will be an estimated 4,125 private sector jobs also disappearing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The defence efficiency review will see a further 8,000 jobs going. That will have devastating effects on regional Australia, as it is in those areas that defence bases are primarily located. The work for the dole scheme&mdash;even by the admission of many in the government itself&mdash;will do nothing to reduce Australia's high and rising unemployment rate, because it does not provide what our young unemployed most need&mdash;skills training. The new Federation Fund, the Liberal Party's slush fund, will not contribute in any way to job generation in 1997&hyphen;98, because the funding will not commence until the 1998&hyphen;99 financial year. This budget is further proof that the Derek Linsells of the world will need to keep sounding warnings long and loud of the devastating effect of unemployment before this government will take any heed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the question of health, health care has continued to cop it in the neck in this budget. The coalition government has shown that, when it comes to health and related community services, it has, over the past two budgets, completely disavowed any concept of accepting the fundamental responsibility of providing a basic, quality and equitable health service to all Australian families. The Labor Party and the vast majority of Australian families see this as a basic tenet of government which will help see them through times of stress and vulnerability. Despite the promise of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) during the last election campaign that there was no secret plan to slash $10 billion from social welfare, even the most basic accounts would
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4734"> show that this is almost exactly what the government has done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister also promised to preserve Medicare. The name has stayed the same and it still has some of its old features but, effectively, it has been whittled away to a very poor imitation of its former self. Doctors' payments for home visits, for example, have been reduced. Gone will be the days when you could get a doctor to call and see you at your home&mdash;no matter how sick you may be. There is nothing in the budget for a public hospital system which has been starved of funding by the cumulative effects of cuts from both Commonwealth and state governments in the last few years. The results are that hospital waiting lists get longer and facilities continue to deteriorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having slashed the pharmaceutical benefits scheme in last year's budget by some $500 million, the government has gone and cut its funding by another $700 million this year under the guise of the therapeutic group premiums arrangement. This is nothing less than a new drugs tax. It means that Australians will pay more for the latest, the safest and best medication for such conditions as high blood pressure, depression, cholesterol and ulcers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under this new drugs tax, the government will provide a full subsidy only for the cheapest drug in each of the six groups of drugs. If patients require one or more of these expensive drugs, they will have to pay the difference. Does the government suggest we find out the financial cost of a given illness before we get sick? If your doctor prescribes one of the new drugs because it is more suited to your condition or it has fewer side effects, you could pay up to $20 a script more. None of this new drugs tax will be calculated for this safety net threshold. It will be getting so that we will have to consult our financial advisers before we get medical advice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we will be faced with is a two&hyphen;tiered health system: one tier for those lucky individuals who can afford the newest, safest and most expensive drugs; the other for the poor unfortunates who will have to take their chances with cheaper, less effective and less safe medicines. For those who are battling to
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> make ends meet, the choice is between what they need and what they can afford.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further to this, a number of medications will be removed from the PBS altogether. They include treatments for such common complaints as stomach problems, diarrhoea and muscle pain and anti-fungal medicines. Pensioners and other concession card holders who are currently paying $3.20 for these drugs will be forced to pay up to $9 from next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Cranbourne, which is in my electorate of Isaacs, has little hope of getting its own Medicare office following the government's plan to close 43 such offices throughout Australia, highlighting yet another broken federal government promise. Plans were announced in this budget to close many Medicare offices, including those of Clayton</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">and Keysborough, in Victoria, which will cause much inconvenience for many of my constituents and may even deter poorer people from seeking medical treatment. The budget obviously spells the death of the prospect of a Cranbourne Medicare office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) visited Cranbourne before the last federal election, more than a year ago now, he promised that the coalition would open a Medicare office within 12 months of it being elected. Rather than honour this promise, the coalition has done everything it can to undermine the Medicare system. It is interested only in bottom lines. The closures will mean the loss of some 1,000 jobs throughout the country and the cutting of services to pensioners and families on tight budgets. Dr Wooldridge had even gone as far as to state that the former Brashs store in Cranbourne Park Shopping Centre would be an ideal site for the new Medicare branch.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure that a large number of residents, particularly the elderly and the unemployed, who now have to travel to Dandenong and Frankston to lodge claims, will be most annoyed, particularly as they had been faithfully promised an office. Many of those people were among the some 1,400 who had signed a petition I collected in 1995 supporting a Medicare office in Cranbourne. Unfortu
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4735"> nately, it was not enough to change the government's mind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another matter equally close to the hearts of the residents of Cranbourne is child care, which has been hit hard in this year's budget with another $320 million being cut over the next four years. This follows the cuts to child care in last year's budget, in which nearly $500 million was removed. These cuts are now only just beginning to hit home, with child&hyphen;care fees increasing between $20 and $40 per week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This year's budget contains cuts which will reduce the number of new child&hyphen;care places and will limit assistance for non&hyphen;work related care to 20 hours per week. The end result of this is that working parents will find it increasingly difficult to afford quality care as the cost goes up, putting it out of the reach of many ordinary working class Cranbourne families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In many households, one partner will end up working solely to pay for child care, so it will no longer be considered worthwhile to work. That will drive one partner out of the work force, impacting upon family income and creating greater hardship on the whole family. In most cases, it will be the mother who will have to quit work. That will suit the government very well as it fits into its 1950s view of how the family home should operate, as well as it being the only way of reducing unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this government has failed to understand is that families need more help, not more cuts. Access to decent and affordable child care is becoming a nightmare for the average family. As I mentioned earlier, the 1996 budget cuts to child care will come into play on 1 July, when those using community based centres will face additional fee increases of about $20 as a result of the ending of operational subsidies. An example of this is the only council sponsored child&hyphen;care centre in Cranbourne. It is in jeopardy because of these cuts to local child&hyphen;care services. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cranbourne Sun</EMPHASIS> newspaper of 13 May says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the cutbacks are introduced, parents may have to pay up to $20 a week extra at Cranbourne's Clarendon Street Child Care Centre, according to centre director Sonia Dawson.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">She said that parents had already discussed taking their children out of the centre and that the centre would have to raise fees or retrench staff if the federal government failed to provide its annual grant, which runs out on June 30. Mrs Dawson said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We're a non-profit organisation already. We have a number of families here who are already talking about maybe having to pull out of care or stop work because of increasing fees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A lot of our mothers are going to have to stay at home. Parents are really quite angry at the moment. If we lose numbers we are going to have to put off staff.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mrs Dawson said that full fees at the centre were about $600 a month, but this could rise by up to $80 monthly if the funding cuts come into effect. She said that many families could not afford an increase in fees and would pull their children out of care, placing the future of the centre in jeopardy. The experience of the Clarendon Street Child Care Centre would be shared by community based child-care centres throughout the country and by the hundreds of thousands of families who depend so heavily on them day in and day out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, might I say that time prevents me from discussing at some length the appalling decision by the government to forsake the massive savings pool which would have developed under the present superannuation settings. The ultimately useless gimmick of the interest rebate is a rebate which, in my view, only the wealthy will receive. I also would have liked to touch on at some length the area of aged care, which has become a sad farce under this government, but that speech can wait until tomorrow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there is one clear message from this budget, it is that the battlers are going to have to battle even harder. They are going to have to dig deeper into their pockets. They are going to have to forgo more services that they have come to depend on. They are going to have to rely on less and less. They are going to have to rely more and more on their own intestinal fortitude, their own wits and their own street cunning to see them through.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The words coming from the Labor Party are in relation to the so&hyphen;called child-care cuts, welfare cuts, health cuts and aged cuts, and the list goes on and on. This talk is nothing more than political rhetoric and attempts to instil into the Australian community worry, anxiety and distress. As far as I am concerned, their actions are nothing more than a disgrace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party is here for one reason only&mdash;to scare the people of this great nation. The misinformation being peddled by the Labor Party, or, more to the point, the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), is nothing more than tripe and should be treated with the contempt it deserves. They obviously learnt nothing from the March 1996 election. I urge the people from her electorate to write and tell her where to get off so she might get some real work to do for a change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year when I spoke to the appropriation bill I mentioned some of the goals which I had set out to achieve for my electorate of Capricornia. One of those goals was to extend the dam wall at Mount Morgan. I am pleased to say that, after much lobbying with my colleagues in the Queensland state government, I have achieved my goal and secured the necessary funds to extend the Mount Morgan dam wall.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also appropriate to share some of the electorate's major successes. There is funding for the new child-care centre at Mount Morgan. Hang on a tick, I just heard the member for Jagajaga state that child care was going to
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> be cut! I must say, it says a lot for her credibility on this issue. Talk about out of touch and out of thinking capacity!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will shortly see the opening of a new Department of Social Security office in Yeppoon. This is top stuff. I have worked tirelessly with my good friend and colleague, Vince Lester, the state member for Keppel, to make this happen. We previously had an office in Yeppoon but, owing to the cuts from the Labor government when they were in office, the previous Labor member closed it. Once again, that was an example of the poor representation of a community that deserves so much.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the disadvantaged areas in the west of my electorate, the operational funding for several child-care centres has been made available. They will receive this funding on the grounds that they meet the criteria. Once again, the member for Jagajaga has been pulling the cat's tail and squealing about issues that are nothing more than purely fictitious&mdash;as with the after school day care funding or latchkey kids. The member for Jagajaga could never comprehend the hurt and upset she has caused many people on this issue. Another win is the approval to receive SBS TV in early 1998 rather than in the year 2001, which was proposed under the Labor government. These are just some of the many achievements we can lay claim to in Capricornia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On taking office in March 1996 I put together an infrastructure plan that would attempt to make Capricornia one of the most progressive and profitable electorates in the country, something the Labor Party just could not pull off. They simply left Rockhampton and Capricornia penniless and with no future direction in relation to employment, capital investment and infrastructure. I say to the people of Capricornia, `I will not do that and I will not let you down.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are the beef capital of Australia. In line with the need for infrastructure to bring export dollars to Capricornia, we now have an Austrade office so industry and primary producers can deal directly with overseas companies to sell their products. The Central Queensland University in Rockhampton has
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4737"> had continual grants to allow it to improve and expand. Therefore, it has been made an educational facility of national significance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rockhampton is the gateway to one of the world's best defence training facilities in the world. The funding for accommodation at Shoalwater Bay in the last budget totalled $1.3 million and was in line with this year's grant of $2.1 million to build a mechanical firing range for most types of ammunition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This shoots us towards the next grant I need for the area&mdash;that is, money for the final extensions to the Rockhampton airport. This will give not only the military the ability to take off and land the fighter aircraft and heavier transport aircraft but also the region an economic boost with the ability to have international passenger and freight aircraft operate out of there as well. In the past 12 months, we have seen several exercises take place. The most recent and perhaps the most familiar to the House is the recent Tandem Thrust exercise&mdash;an amphibian exercise involving American and Australian forces. This saw some 20,000 defence personnel in Central Queensland and an injection of some $15 million to $20 million into the local economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Singapore armed forces, under a memorandum of agreement with the government, undertake annual training exercises at Shoalwater Bay. In 1996 some 4,500 Singaporean troops took R&amp;R in and around the electorate and injected an additional $20 million into the local economy. I envisage that my electorate will see similar benefits again when the exercise gets under way later this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The success of the Shoalwater Bay training area and the financial gains it has brought to my electorate must be further enhanced. It is for this reason that I will work to see the development of the further extensions to the Rockhampton airport. At present, Rockhampton airport is listed as an alternative airport for international aircraft to other major centres, for example, Brisbane and Townsville. The only problem is that we are short of the full distance&mdash;3,200 metres&mdash;required for heavy loaded aircraft with a maximum take off and landing distance in accordance with the regulations. Upgrading of the airport to
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> accommodate 747 aircraft will provide a major role in supporting and capturing the economic expansion in the region. I have made representations to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, the honourable John Sharp, on this basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The military exercises have been instrumental in testing the capacity of the existing Rockhampton airport and recent extensions have seen Singapore Airlines Airbus 310s and Qantas 767 aircraft take off and land in accordance with the regulations. We believe that opportunities exist to expand the business received from the Singapore defence forces and to secure new business from other countries, such as Canada and the United States. Opportunities also exist for expanding international freight businesses through the airport, particularly in high value agricultural and manufacturing commodities. An upgraded airport could service a substantial range of development in the wider Rockhampton region, including major project development in the Gladstone area and possible energy, mining and agricultural developments in the Surat Basin/Dawson Valley area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Local tourism operators have advised that long travel international flights to another part of the country then further domestic air travel for international tourists visiting the area is a major impediment to the expansion of international tourism. I have had personal conversations with the President of Iwasaki Sangyo, owner of the Capricornia International Resort at Yeppoon, Mr Fukuzo Iwasaki, who argues that an upgraded airport would enable him to expand their charter operations and pressure the airlines to ensure that scheduled international flights stop over in Rockhampton. The Capricornia International Resort at Yeppoon has recently chartered flights from Japan to Rockhampton and we would like to see this continued. Business travel to the area would also benefit from expanded services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My electorate of Capricornia is also in a position to capitalise on the 2000 Olympics. Rockhampton and Central Queensland annually host many state and national titles and continue to develop Olympic standard facilities. How many regional centres can boast that they have an internationally approved
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4738"> hockey surface? Rockhampton's Kalka Shades field has a Polytan wet surface, which will accommodate high level international competition. It is recognised as the most successful surface throughout world hockey circles. Full credit must go to Rockhampton Hockey for the work they have put in to provide Central Queensland with such a facility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many other issues that I could talk about in relation to the 2000 Olympics and Capricornia. Capricornia is, of course, very close to my heart. My employers expect a degree of result while I am in this parliament and they can expect that I will attempt to deliver. As far as the ALP is concerned, they have made many commitments in the past. They have not delivered. We will and we intend to do this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I finish with this: we have made a commitment to the Australian people and we will put in place more than the ALP has ever achieved. We have promised that we will have a $1.6 billion surplus. The difference between us and the Labor Party is the l&hyphen;a&hyphen;w law&mdash;we will deliver.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot let the opportunity go by to respond to one or two of the points made by the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Marek). It never ceases to amaze me that every National Party member in the federal parliament since probably 1901 has believed that an international airport should be built in their electorate. If there is one thing that this country does not need it is another international airport in Queensland. The costs associated with the airport at Rockhampton have been investigated on many, many occasions by people from both sides of this parliament when in and out of government and it has never stacked up in economic terms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I appreciate the comments that my colleague makes and his right to defend his own electorate in this place. You are absolutely correct in respect of wanting to say that. But in pure economic terms, there are costs associated with putting customs services in and a range of other matters&mdash;not to mention, of course, extending the runway to carry 747 aircraft and new generation aircraft that are
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> coming. So I really think it is a little bit of a pie in the sky sort of view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as the Olympics are concerned, I also congratulate the honourable member for drawing the House's attention to the fact that there is a wet based hockey surface available for training purposes and for the Olympic Games and preparation for it, but I might also say to the honourable member that there are many similar regions around Australia with the same claims, and it is going to be quite a battle to secure some of those training facilities for international teams as they come here in the lead-up to the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tonight in this debate I want to refer specifically to my own electorate of Cunningham and, more generally, to the Illawarra and to what has happened to our region as a result of the change in government last year. There are a number of matters which I think are quite pertinent. Whilst my colleague who preceded me wanted to talk about what the government had done for him, I can tell him that in a region like my own, regrettably, the unemployment rate is still about four or five percentage points above the national average. It is unacceptably high and is showing no signs of moving. I must say that I am delighted to see the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) in the House tonight. We would have expected that any government which purported to represent the interests of all Australians might have shown a little bit of care and compassion for the Illawarra, but that is certainly not the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will run through some of the issues that are facing my constituents in the Illawarra, and in Wollongong specifically. The first decision, taken last year, was that of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) to shut down the office of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs in Wollongong. That occurred in October 1996. People from something like 80 different nationalities choose to make Wollongong and the Illawarra their home. The biggest throughput of constituent matters through my office relate to immigration. This department's presence has now gone because the government decided it needed to shut the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4739"> office down. The reason advanced was cost cutting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had to laugh. The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs was at a function put on by an Italian group in my electorate recently. He made no mention of the fact that his decision to do this had been taken last year or that he had actually cut the funding for the aged care worker with the particular group that had invited him along on the night. Fortunately, the lord mayor, who was asked to speak, made sure that the people there got to hear of that particular oversight in the minister's speech. I am sure they will appreciate that in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, who is at the table, would also be aware that cutbacks in funding for higher education in Australia more generally clearly have had an impact on the University of Wollongong. I know that the minister is aware that the University of Wollongong enjoys a substantial reputation, not only in this country but also certainly internationally.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="KEMP" NAMEID="BT4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BT4">Dr Kemp</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has 50 per cent private income.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8I4">Mr MARTIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The minister has made reference to the fact that perhaps that institution's private income from international students is something which should in some way offset the government's funding cut. I do not necessarily believe that, because an institution like the University of Wollongong has been able to attract world&hyphen;class academics to teach there, because it has also been very pro-active in attracting students from not only the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region but also the Middle East, in line with government policies&mdash;both the previous government and the current government&mdash;that university therefore should have to suffer from public education funding cuts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because those funds have been cut, the University of Wollongong has had to make some very hard decisions on some of the courses it is proposing to offer in subsequent years and the impact that is going to have on academics. In fact, estimates from the university suggest that something like 150 staff could be lost over coming years because of
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> those funding cuts. I think that is regrettable because the sorts of courses which are offered by the University of Wollongong are quite outstanding. For example, we have a world reputation on telecommunications technology and we have world recognised leaders in the heads of those various departments. That has been instrumental in our endeavours to attract new industry to the Illawarra in the area of telecommunications infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra itself has clearly identified that responsibility, as has the New South Wales government, which has declared that the University of Wollongong should be the centre of excellence for telecommunications in New South Wales. Again, that is a great compliment to our university and to the work that is being undertaken there and it is also a great reflection on the quality of staff that have been attracted. Anything that will impinge upon that is to be regretted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also cannot help but reflect upon the decision last year in the budget, which has not been remedied in this budget, to cut the regional development fund. It is no coincidence that whenever the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) is asked a question or is called in this place we on this side simply say, `No, just Transport.' Regrettably, that is all that is left of his portfolio. I am sure my very good friend and corridor colleague, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Ronaldson), who has now joined us in the chamber, is aware of these criticisms, because I have certainly made them known to him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting that $150 million was cut last year and has not been in any way returned to regional development funding this year to help areas like the Illawarra. I again say to the parliamentary secretary that, with unemployment levels as unacceptably high as they are in the Illawarra, there is a real need for positive government assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of the funding that was made available by the previous government under the REDO program, the Illawarra REDO, which I have the great pleasure and honour to chair, has just handed down a new regional development strategy for the Illawarra. It is a
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4740"> departure from regional development strategies of the past. It was completed by Coopers and Lybrand. It has proposed a series of business plans to encourage something like 20 different projects to the Illawarra. It has been done on the basis of interviews with community leaders and so on, and it has specifically identified and targeted 20&hyphen;odd projects, 13 of which are priority projects, and has suggested a business plan for each of those. In that respect, it is a completely different way of dealing with regional development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that all of us in this place can recall various endeavours by people like Bill Kelty and Lindsay Fox, when travelling Australia on behalf of the former government, to come up with virtually a wish&hyphen;list of projects which they hoped the Commonwealth government might in some way be able to fund. Certainly, you could always get a wish&hyphen;list of projects&mdash;many of them have holy grail status in certain regions, and it is no different in the Illawarra&mdash;but at the end of the day that does not achieve an effective outcome, either in an economic or in a social sense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the business plan we have adopted as a REDO does provide some opportunity for us; nevertheless, it is disappointing that no funding has been included in this budget for regional development programs. I know that the parliamentary secretary responsible for this, who comes from a region himself and who has a very substantial profile within his own electorate as somebody who champions the cause of regions, must find it very disquieting that his government has not seen fit to put funding back into this particular area. I know that he must be feeling just what I am feeling: absolute and bitter disappointment with his government in this respect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth dental care program for battlers has been stopped cold. In my electorate, this has affected the Bulli Hospital, where a clinic has been established and where the waiting time has now been pushed out to several years. I find it extraordinary that a government which went to the people of this country saying that they want us all to feel comfortable and relaxed are now saying to the pensioners of my electorate, `Well, you are
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> going to feel comfortable and relaxed but your teeth aren't and certainly not for about two or three years more because that is the waiting time before you can have your teeth repaired.' I find it an absolute scandal that this should be the case. Much has been remarked on it in the Illawarra. Submissions have been made to the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge), but they have fallen on deaf ears. Again, there is no restoration of funding for this in the last budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Public housing is another great cause of concern in a region like mine. The simple fact is that it is so difficult for those people who require public housing to have a degree of certainty surrounding their future housing needs when the government simply says to the New South Wales or to any other state government, `I am sorry, we are going to cut out all the money for public housing. What we will do is in some way give some funding to individual people that meet certain criteria to have public housing.' I have not quite worked out how that will work yet. They have actually said that the way that will happen in the future will mean there will be no further funding for capital stock.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there is no further funding for capital stock, we will get into a situation where some unscrupulous landlords will end up charging the earth for people that are public housing tenants at the present moment. We could eventually see the slum&hyphen;like conditions which have developed in many places in countries like the United States and so on. I do not think that is what Australia wants, and I certainly do not think it is what Australians deserve. It is such a regrettable philosophical position that the coalition government in this country has taken. It has continued to slash and burn all in the name&mdash;as my friend the member for Capricornia suggested&mdash;of trying to get a budget into surplus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He made some comment about that. I might remind him that in recent economic times, although there is much derision from the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in recent question times about the former government, it was only a Labor government that was able to sustain at least three budget surpluses. We
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4741"> will be very interested to see whether or not this government is able to achieve one, let alone three.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Flood mitigation works and funding have been cut by this government. Wollongong City Council's flood mitigation works have been placed on hold following the federal government's withdrawal of funding not only in the last budget but also in this budget. Again, in an area like the Illawarra&mdash;which many people know is a magnificent part of the coastline of Australia&mdash;enormous numbers of streams and rivers and so on flow down from the escarpment to the coast. This causes considerable problems in some areas, particularly low lying areas of the Illawarra. It always falls to the council to carry out flood mitigation works. I would have thought that in the protection of property and the protection of lives the Commonwealth government might have an interest in this and might make funding available for flood mitigation works, but again it simply has not happened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn to some of the other big ticket items that were announced in this budget that will affect the Illawarra. There are two in particular which have caused an enormous amount of anger. The first is the decision by this government to shut down two Medicare offices in the Illawarra&mdash;one at Corrimal, where my electorate office is located, and the other in Warrawong, which is in the electorate of my friend and colleague the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That leaves two Medicare offices for the entire Illawarra: one in central Wollongong and one at Shell Harbour Square Shopping Centre. Public transport being what it is, the unemployment situation being what it is, this is placing an enormous burden on the residents of Wollongong's northern suburbs and southern suburbs in accessing Medicare offices where they need to discuss issues with staff who have been trained to give advice on the forms and on claiming the appropriate rebates and so on. To simply say that this is a position that may be fixed by the installation of fax machines in some doctors' surgeries or pharmacies is an absolute abdication of responsibility in this very important area.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second major issue that emerged from the sell&hyphen;off of Australia by this government was the decision to sell the Commonwealth office block in Wollongong. It is one of quite a number of properties which the government has decided to sell. It is one of 56 Commonwealth owned buildings around the nation that are going to be sold. We are all looking forward to the day when the `For sale: John Howard Real Estate Agency' is put on the one in Wollongong. I can tell you that it will raise considerable anger within the local community, as it already has.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a building which is part of the civic precinct in the Illawarra. It is adjacent to the Wollongong City Council chambers. There is no legitimate reason why this building should be sold. I say that because in the last two budgets decisions taken by this coalition government have seen quite a number of public servant positions made redundant or transferred out of the Illawarra. For example, DEETYA no longer has an area office. It has been downgraded to a regional office. Therefore, the need for additional accommodation in other parts of Wollongong CBD has now disappeared. They can quite easily be housed in the Commonwealth office block. I would have thought rent return from a building which the Commonwealth owns is far more preferable than the sale of this building. It is of considerable concern to the people in my electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are the cuts to child care that we have heard much about both from last year's budget and from this year's budget. That there is the philosophy that suggests that women should be denied access to child care or limited to 20 hours a week, that people who are trying to improve themselves should be denied an opportunity to put children in child care so they can go for appropriate training&mdash;all of these are issues which people in my constituency have raised with me over the last several weeks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A further issue is the ongoing saga about the airport and the decision by this government to resurrect a proposition for an airport to be constructed at Holsworthy. As I recall it, when the EIS on the 10 appropriate sites
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4742"> was produced back in 1984, Holsworthy was number eight out of 10.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was nine out of 10, my friend the member for Werriwa corrects me. Suddenly, there it is. From Fairy Meadow north, depending on the alignment chosen by this government, we will see an incredible amount of aircraft placed over the northern suburbs of Wollongong. Quite clearly, that is unacceptable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, let me state my gravest concern for decisions that have not been taken by this government&mdash;that is, the concern about the future of the great Australian steel industry. The simple fact is that this is a government devoid of any ideas when it comes to industry policy. We have seen the result of that in Newcastle. I note that my colleague the member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) is with us this evening during the course of this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The implications for Illawarra are just as stark. Two weeks before BHP announced their decision to shut down steel making in Newcastle, community leaders in Wollongong were told that between 1,200 and 2,000 jobs were also going to disappear at the BHP works. The fact that they have invested $3 billion in new technology, I suspect, is probably one of the major reasons why further hard decisions were not taken there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a need for this government to look at a steel industry plan, as we have been suggesting. We want to know that there is security of employment for people in the Illawarra. It is an industry which is so important to our area. It is an industry off which a number of other companies feed in terms of manufacturing and fabrication, and it is still the backbone of the Illawarra. I simply suggest to this government that they have to take a good, hard, long look at their industry policy and give security to people of the Illawarra in terms of its future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rather than being comfortable and relaxed as a result of the two budgets that have come down in the last 15 months by this government, the people of the Illawarra are anything but. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to make some comments on the second Howard&hyphen;Costello budget in this debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1997&hyphen;98. A bit like their first, this is a budget of mirror and rubber. First you see it and then you do not; it is all done with mirrors when you try to find out what is going on, and, of course, the figures are rubbery, as they were in the last budget. In my speech on the Appropriation Bill last year I pointed out that the growth figures in last year's budget were never going to be met. We all knew that. They were always shonky. They are shonky now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We can take little things like Telstra borrowing $3 billion and then giving it to the government. So you get a $3 billion cash gift. This is somehow good budgeting! We saw the transfer of $3.7 billion out of last year's forward estimates into a savings scheme that will actually reduce national savings. It is all mirrors. What is being put forward is something that the government, ourselves and the commentators all understand is not what is going to happen, and the words do not mean what they are supposed to mean. So savings are not savings and borrowings off Telstra are not borrowings at all. That money that comes from the government does not really affect it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a government run by slogans. Let us go through a few of those slogans. I am talking about slogans such as `free market', the `black armband brigade', `comfortable and relaxed', and `the battlers', of course. That is a one-word slogan. The fact is that you cannot govern by slogans, you cannot govern by mantras and you cannot govern by mirrors and rubbery figures. I will give a few examples of that. Things actually change; the world moves on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the black armband brigade slogan was working so well in the polls last year and was getting a good response in terms of the focus groups, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) got very attached to it. Then we were suddenly hit with a report last week, the likes of which none of us have ever imagined or contemplated. Sure, we have all heard stories and, sure, we have all heard complaints about children being taken away and families being
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4743"> broken up. But I defy anybody in this place to actually admit or state that they actually knew of the dimensions, the depth and the sheer enormity of what has taken place in this country over the last 200 years, particularly over the last 60 years, as that report puts forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That report changes everything. You cannot go on saying that things are the same. What we said last week or the week before or last year does not get changed. The black armband brigade is not fashionable now. It is not appropriate. In fact, it is more than that&mdash;it is downright insulting. That report is not about guilt; it is about responsibility, it is about nationhood and it is about we as human beings, not what we thought hundreds of years ago or 60 years ago, but what we think now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was an article in the paper on Friday written by Tony Wright, I think, pointing out that there are probably thousands of men alive now who sexually abused young Aboriginal girls in the last 30 or 40 years. They are still alive, the girls are still alive and, in many cases, the official system knows about it, yet they have never been charged. At the same time we as a community are being adamant about paedophilia in all other forms. We are being adamant about the incidents that have occurred in religious orders and in state orphanages, but we are ignoring this one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why aren't the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) referring the information in that report to the federal and state police forces to investigate those foster homes where those young girls and boys were sexually abused? Why aren't they? Is it because of the black armband brigade? Is it because they will feel guilty about it? What kind of mentality and morality are we talking about here?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We were told in recent months about euthanasia and Christianity and how we should value the sanctity of human life. The same people are saying that they have no responsibility for this and it has nothing to do with them. The fact is that there are young Aboriginal girls alive now who were sexually abused, and it is being absolutely ignored. We have heard not one comment from the Prime
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Minister or the responsible minister. The sheer hypocrisy of that is breathtaking. And those mantras will come back to haunt them over and over again as the world moves on and they are seen for what they are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to look at another of those mantras&mdash;the free market. Last week a speech was given in Canberra by I think Mr Cameron which was reported on briefly. It pointed out that people in the community now have a concern about the lack of an industry policy. That became very clear when BHP made an announcement to terminate steel making in Newcastle, but the announcement was actually not about that; it was to reverse a decision to invest in new steel making.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A decision made in June 1995 to invest half a billion dollars in new steel making was reversed on 29 April. And the government said, `It's none of our business. It is because of market forces. It is a commercial decision. We are not responsible.' That they did not really care was the message that Australia got. The government said, `It's nothing to do with us. Sure, we will come and mop up the mess. If you need some employment programs, we might help you with a few bucks here and there.' Senator Vanstone offered $2 million, but the BHP workers qualify for none of it. To qualify for any of that money, people have to be unemployed for nine months. What a joke. What a hoax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the real message was that the government was impotent and uncaring and this was not part of their mantra because this was a commercial decision made by a commercial company on commercial grounds. BHP's commercial grounds on 29 April were a 15 per cent return on capital. Remember that?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come back to that interjection. Last week BHP announced their changed investment guidelines. In future, their investment decisions will be based on a benchmark of the world's top 20 per cent of companies in the same field. The fact is that their steel division is in the world's top 20 per cent. The BHP steel division in Australia is one of the best earners in steel in the world. It is one of the few in
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4744"> the world making money. According to their new guidelines, a few weeks later they would not have made that decision. How do you judge commercial decisions? What do they mean? Where is the government amongst all this? Looking at bandaid packages after the fact to try to minimise their electoral impact. To hell with the social and economic impacts in terms of the real economy, the exports of this country and adding value to our resources. The government are simply aiming at trying to stem the political haemorrhaging for their one member in the region.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will come back to steel later but, as to the interjection from the parliamentary secretary, yes, virtually all of those programs announced by Senator Vanstone are for those who are eligible, for those who are suitably qualified.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just learn a bit about what you are talking about for a change. You come to town and parade around, making promises that you know are false. Virtually all of those programs were for the long-term unemployed&mdash;not for the people who are currently working at BHP but who are going to lose their jobs. The programs that do that are linked to the industry. They are not broad ranging programs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another slogan that was quite interesting was `comfortable and relaxed'. That really does invoke a nice image: people work hard, they go home, they put up their feet and they relax, feeling secure and confident. People want to be confident that when they retire we will support and protect them in their old age.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, in terms of working, job insecurity has never been worse than it is currently. And why? Because the government spent the last year talking the economy down. They spent the last year telling us all how bad it is. Go and talk to my constituents&mdash;they all think it is dreadful. Why? Because every day the Treasurer (Mr Costello) got up and told them so. For the first nine months of this govern
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment they got up every day and said, `Things are dreadful. We're in a dreadful mess. What a dreadful situation which needs massive surgery,' and they cut the hell out of the economy for half a per cent of growth. In other words, they were going to kill the economy to cure it. I am sorry but the economy is actually dead right now. It has been dead for the last six or nine months. It was killed by the current government. So much for being confident about the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apart from the contraction of the work force, particularly the Public Service in Canberra, which is appalling and unnecessary and will eventually cost us more than it saves, apart from the message about Telstra and its job losses, apart from the whole message about downsizing that the government has been on about&mdash;one of its mantras, again&mdash;those who are working are not comfortable and relaxed. They are nervous, scared and worried.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In our parliamentary inquiry we saw the response from those in small business. I was part of that inquiry, and let me tell the House that those out there in small business are not comfortable and relaxed at all. If that report is not adopted in the key parts of the legislation underpinning the franchising code, the tenancy code and the changes to the Trade Practices Act, you guys will have a real problem because that is not just good but absolutely essential for those people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have literally dozens and dozens of constituents who are facing bankruptcy right now because the economy has been flattened and they are defenceless at the same time. Of course, those who were looking to be `comfortable and relaxed' when they retire knew our system and made their plans for retirement according to that, but in many cases they have been forced to take a retrenchment. Whether or not they have some assets or whatever, they knew about nursing homes and hostels and the system was understood. How do they feel now that nursing home access will cost $88,000, if they are lucky? It will be more like $120,000. The $26,000 entry fee was never on. Look at the figures and talk to anybody who knows the industry and you will find that was always a joke. We are talking
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4745"> about $100,000 more. We all know that, and we have known that since the last budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that you cannot rip out of a budget half a billion dollars for residential aged care without making someone else pay for it. What about retired people, people facing retirement or families with a retired relative&mdash;in many cases uncles and aunties with no other family? What happens to residents in a nursing home which has been sold and are required to move? Many such cases have involved distant relatives and they have been required to pay entry fees into the next nursing home. They cannot do it. They have been moved from one nursing home which has been closed and they have to try to find a bed in another.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As well as the impact on the nursing homes, the assault on the PBS system and the new, `wonderful' technology that can now group therapeutic drugs into families for like conditions, we have this `wonderful' new science where the federal bureaucracy can now tell doctors how to prescribe drugs&mdash;anti-depressants, anti&hyphen;hypertension, anti-ulcers. There are a range of conditions, but for any one condition a family of drugs can be chosen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we are now telling our aged, our chronically ill and people who desperately need medication daily&mdash;and in many cases in large amounts daily&mdash;that their doctor is required to prescribe the lowest drug in that family. If they do not, they pay the extra. Whether that drug suits their condition does not matter. The idea that somehow these conditions are simple to treat and that everybody with high blood pressure has the same problem and can therefore take the same drug is codswallop.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is absolute bureaucratic, governmental interference at its very worst, and it will not work as well. Already we are being called by people anxious and concerned about how it is going to work, what drug will be available and how much extra it will cost them. We did not do that. This is a government that is somehow caught up in its own ideology and its own mantras.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to come back to the issue of steel for a moment because there are some things I want to put on the record which I think are
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> going to be important in the years ahead. I have said in this House on more than one occasion that we, as a country, export 130 million tonnes of iron ore worth about $40 a tonne. That would equate to about 100 million tonnes of steel worth between $400 and $500 a tonne. So the fact is that the actual change in value is enormous, apart from the hundreds of thousands of jobs that are involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we are going to maintain a steel industry in this country, we need to invest in it. At the moment, virtually 80 per cent of the industry has decided not to invest any further. They have announced that they are going to run down the capital base in steel. What is therefore likely to happen is one of two things. Firstly, our industry will run down and eventually implode and collapse as imports get stronger and stronger. The second option is that we may develop a new industry on the west coast which will be foreign owned with foreign investment and transfer priced. So we would convert our iron ore into a higher value, but the total control of that would be by the foreign investors, not by Australia. So we would have a steel industry in Australia that was not Australian. That is one of the very serious choices and one of the very real possibilities that we are likely to see.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In talking about those things in recent months we have been talking about the need for an industry policy. We have been talking about the need for a steel plan&mdash;call it a plan, call it a strategy, call it an approach, call it what you like. It does not matter what the word is, but the plan needs to be coherent and it needs to encourage the conversion of our raw materials of iron ore, gas and/or coal into metals of some form and sell them at a higher value.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That plan needs to have incorporated in it probably things like competitive investment regimes so that we are a competitive country to invest in. It probably needs things in it that make sure we look at technology for our raw materials as a major national priority. It probably needs things in it like bilateral negotiations with other countries to make sure that we can export to them at a higher value and not always at the bottom of the chain, as we are now in virtually most of our exports
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4746"> into Asia. It also probably needs in it the idea that BHP may need to get out of steel. If our biggest iron ore company is not interested in steel, then it should make way for someone who is. I do not doubt the possibility of Australia attracting investment in that kind of way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This second Howard budget is different from the first. The first, if you like, was triumphal in how much damage it was going to do to individuals and to the economy. It made, if you like, a virtue of the pain it could cause, knowing that the pain would not come until much later on. This budget is almost the opposite. It is totally deceitful, because it pretends to be doing something when it is doing very little&mdash;other than those very narrow, nasty targets, particularly on pharmaceuticals, and of course the savings rebate, which will end up reducing our nation's savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are seeing a government that is now consolidated into a process of government by mantras and by slogans. In fact those mantras are now turning into negatives and they are the opposite of what the country needs. Mr Speaker, I welcome you to the chair.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I opened my Sunday paper this week and read an article which has left me flabbergasted. Having worked all year to ensure parents in need have adequate child&hyphen;care assistance, I am amazed to find there are people who believe that the taxpayers should be paying non&hyphen;working parents to continue their hobbies. This week's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Mail</EMPHASIS>  devoted a full page to child care with three stories&mdash;one headed, `Needy versus the greedy', another headed, `A case of triple trouble' and the third headed, `Family can't pay rise'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">First, let me focus on the `Needy versus the greedy' article. This article quoted a child-care provider as saying that it was time parents took responsibility for their children. Other operators are quoted as saying that non-working parents are using child-care centres as dumping grounds. I point out that these are the operators, not politicians or bean counters. These are people in the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course there is another side to the story. The director of a centre in Shailer Park was quoted as saying that the new limit would send women `back to the home', and:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I strongly believe there is an element in the Liberal Party which would love to see women back in the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> home, which in this day and age is a totally antiquated view.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Call me old fashioned, but I have no problem with non&hyphen;working women&mdash;or men&mdash;being at home with their children. Correct me if I am wrong, but I thought that is what you called parenthood.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second article to which I refer tells the story of a mother with triplets, two of whom have disabilities, and a terminally ill husband. This is the sort of family that our government is trying to help.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, it was the third article that really knocked me for six. The article starts:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Three year old Ashleigh and her big sister, Krystal, five, spend thirty hours a week behind the fences of the Woodridge Childcare Centre.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This makes the centre sound like a bit of a gaol from the outset, which I am sure the operators would not be pleased about. However, the article goes on and it paints a very odd picture indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The mother of these children openly admits that she does not have the patience to spend every day with her daughters. She said that, at the centre, they learn; at home, they fight. The mother also admits that her children would rather be at the centre than at home with her. Of course this does not seem to be a concern for the mother, as she is busy with her hobbies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the change in hours comes in, this mother will be forced, due to financial pressures, to give up some of her taxpayer funded hobbies. Let us take a quick look at her present situation. She is currently paying $67 a week out of a total child-care bill of $275. This means the taxpayer is paying her $208 a week to enjoy her hobbies at leisure, untroubled by the daily routine of raising her children. And you ask why I am amazed. But that is not all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This mother cannot understand why people would judge her and not those who pay a nanny. I can tell her why. It is because those paying a nanny are not asking the taxpayer to foot the bill. This is the sort of person the shadow minister for scare is defending over the 20&hyphen;hour issue.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4749">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I was bringing up my family, I did not have taxpayer funded child care, nor perhaps would most of the mothers in this House.

I am a firm believer that the government should help those in genuine need and support working parents with young children who have no other options.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently, I met with a number of child-care providers in my electorate. It was a very productive meeting and I came away with a good appreciation of the needs of many parents, but the providers also benefited by gaining a greater understanding of the government's philosophies towards child care. I will be holding regular meetings with my providers in an attempt to keep them fully briefed on government policy and myself up to date with the problems of the industry. But is it little wonder that the taxpaying public is getting more than a little concerned with this issue when you have instances such as this that I have described tonight?</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="4749"><TITLE><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bringing Them Home</EMPHASIS></TITLE>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> or fending for ourselves; and then the survival skills that we needed in order to survive in the mainstream community, because those survival skills are certainly not skills that you learn in a major institution. And the whole family value system was not there and then the practice that comes with that was not there and put in place.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The next quote is from a New South Wales man taken to a babies home in Melbourne in 1971 at the age of 12 months:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My feelings throughout life, of hurt, pain and neglection began as far back as I can remember. . . I was taken from my family . . . along with my biological brother, he also was with me through everything, if it wasn't for him, I probably would not be alive today to be able to write about my past.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The next quote is from a man fostered at two years of age in the 1950s who was then placed in a reformatory at 14:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It did lead to a career in crime in which, to me, well, it wasn't crime that turned me on, even though I was successful at it. It was getting back at society. It was kicking `em, y'know? It wasn't crime, it was the fact that, well, I'm going to pay back now for 20 odd years. Now, I served something like 5 years in the prisons, not because I wanted to be a criminal, but because I didn't know where I was, I didn't know who I belonged to.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">A Western Australian mother spoke of her two sons taken in the 1960s:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They grew up to mix with other troubled children in Tardon and didn't know how to mix with us their mother and family, they only knew how to mix with other boys that they grew up with and these boys were boys stealing, so my sons went with them, they couldn't do without the crowd that they group up with. I couldn't tell them anything at this stage cause they felt that coloured people were nothing and that is when they went on the wrong road.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of my sons was put into gaol for four years and the other one died before he could reach the age of 21 years.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last week a report from New South Wales showed that the suicide rates amongst doctors are 50 per cent higher than for the rest of the population. The particular at&hyphen;risk groups include junior hospital doctors, rural doctors and women doctors. On the weekend, the President of the AMA called on all state and territory health ministers to work on implementing strategies to address this issue and announced a $300,000 campaign to highlight it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The New South Wales report revealed that junior doctors are particularly vulnerable. Shouldering life or death responsibility as young as 23 and still suffused with the vestiges of the `doctor as God' syndrome, many have nowhere to turn to and have little insight that they as healers can suffer from things like depression like everyone else. From my own experience I know that, at the end of a 30&hyphen;hour shift, you can sometimes feel as if you are dead on your feet. You can sometimes be operating almost like an automaton.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Three years after graduating from medical school, a member of my class took his life after working for months at nights as a locum. Another doctor who was a neighbour of mine back in Adelaide took his life last year while working in New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From my own experience I would have to say that night shift work can be particularly debilitating: working nights while everyone else is asleep and having to sleep during the day. I have a great deal of admiration for nurses, who have to do a lot of shift work, and also for all the medical staff who work
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> night shifts. I hope that the AMA's campaign does include the issue of shift work because changing from day to night shifts and back again can create a tremendous dislocation to the body clock. There are studies showing a number of ailments which are much more common in people who work shifts. That dislocation can lead not only to a physical isolation but also to an emotional isolation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not just the long hours that need to be addressed. Personally, I found the 30&hyphen;hour shifts tiring. But actually changing from day to night shift and back again every fortnight is something that is incredibly depressing and physically and emotionally draining. It is a lot tougher even though you are working fewer hours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are dealing with can only be described as a tragic waste of talented and bright young Australian lives. I note that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Aspects of youth suicide</EMPHASIS>, states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Until recent years, there has been little valid research on youth suicide, at an Australian or international level. While there is some divergence in the research literature as to whether suicide is mainly caused by mental illness or sociological factors, there is a growing subscription to the view that youth suicide is a deeply complex issue influenced by many factors, including mental health and wider sociological influences. The Committee recognises that any programmes or funding for youth suicide prevention must be underpinned by valid research demonstrating the causes of youth suicide, its prevalence amongst various groups and the best way of combating the problem.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Paragraph 48 of the report reinforces the need for education campaigns to veer away from words and images such as `suicide prevention' and instead to focus on depression awareness and problem&hyphen;solving skills. Other requirements in addressing the issues outlined in the report include information access, family support, integrated research programs, national departmental coordination and a review of current youth suicide prevention strategies and funding policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I support the AMA's initiative on junior doctors' working hours and encourage all state and territory health ministers to be aware of and to address this important issue.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to put on the public record the reasons for my shifting position in this House during the week. It was certainly no personal snub to the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson), much as I find many of her policies obnoxious, divisive and extremely damaging to Australia's moral fibre and its economic future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am concerned about the polarisation of most of the Independents around a common theme, plus their forming of parties&mdash;and the exception to this is the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher). I cannot see how any member can stand in this place, be the head of a party and claim to have any independent status. A party becomes subject to vested interests, whether they be unions, big business or pressure groups. I was glad to hear today that the member for Oxley dissociated herself publicly from the League of Rights. That is perhaps one positive move in this totally obnoxious movement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am appalled at the tiptoeing of the government in particular and, to some degree, the opposition around the issue of the member for Oxley and her movement because that cut to immigration announced a week or so ago was an appalling reaction to the fear of losing part of the vote out there. I find it absolutely frightening to think that we lack so much leadership that such a reaction should be taken to a person who, at best, enjoys about seven per cent of the vote in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock), who I notice from his body language was very upset at being rolled in cabinet over the immigration issue, spoke in this House yesterday in answer to a question about the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bringing them home</EMPHASIS> issue and the Kruger and Bray case. He justified this government's reaction by comparing it to the former government's. He quoted from the former government's 1995 report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is clear that the definition of the term genocide and the Genocide Convention that, before genocide will be committed, one or other of the acts listed in the article must have been carried out with the

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I put to the House that what has occurred is documented not only in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bringing them home</EMPHASIS>  report but also in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Outcasts in White Australia</EMPHASIS>  by C.D. Rowley, the eminent anthropologist, published in 1970, and in his earlier work, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Destruction of Aboriginal Society. </EMPHASIS> In that he said, in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Governments with large `full&hyphen;blood' populations tried by means of segregation to limit further part&hyphen;Aboriginal births.

Conveniently the `full&hyphen;bloods' seemed to be dying out; the part&hyphen;Aborigines were to be placed in such situations that there would eventually be no traces of them.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That, to my mind, is&mdash;according to my definition of what the minister read out yesterday&mdash;genocide. It is not too strong a term.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to comment on the comments made by the previous speaker, the member for Calare (Mr Andren), and say to him that he should have the experience to realise that any change in immigration program numbers does not happen in a week. The program is carefully worked out over many months, with the backbench immigration committee working with the minister to work out how we can find solutions in our plans for the years hence to the problems that were caused by the Labor government's overuse of increased numbers in immigration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Enough of that. Tonight I wish to inform the House about some welcome news for the homeless young people in my electorate of Makin. One of the most satisfying aspects of representing the people of Makin in this place
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4752"> is to be able to work towards achieving real and much needed assistance to those members of my local community who are in genuine need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The homeless young people of Makin will benefit from funding from the job placement, employment and training program announced by the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Amanda Vanstone. Disadvantaged young people in Makin will now receive further assistance to help them overcome the barriers to finding a job and a better quality of life. The Salvation Army's Ingle Farm Community Services in Pooraka will receive this funding to assist 100 homeless young people in Makin. The project aims to engage disadvantaged youths in activities which will enable them to develop work skills and behaviours which will help them progress towards further education and training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the biggest disadvantages facing these young people is lack of motivation due to a sense of hopelessness which has developed after years of setbacks and of neglect by the previous Labor government. The object of this program is to restore their self&hyphen;respect and their belief in the future. The program will involve adventure camping and various outdoor activities to provide a medium to help motivate young people and assist them in developing interpersonal skills through team activities. Young people will be linked to specific programs which address their vocational and personal needs. This may involve referral to drug&hyphen;alcohol rehabilitation and support programs and work experience and training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people of Makin recognise the valuable work done by the Salvation Army in our local community. I have informed the newly appointed National Secretary of the Salvation Army, Lieutenant Colonel Donald T. Woodland, of my appreciation for the work done by the Ingle Farm Salvation Army Community Services. They really are a community treasure. Young people deserve a fair go. That is what the Howard coalition government, the Salvation Army and many other community and business organisations aim to provide.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Providing encouragement and incentive to young people and providing them with real opportunities, skills and, ultimately, real jobs is what the Howard government is all about. No greater proof is needed than the establishment of the work for the dole project, a project which has received overwhelming support from the battlers in Makin. It has received their support because, unlike those opposite, the people of Makin recognise that there is a need to provide unemployed young people with meaningful work experience that will lift their spirits and provide them with the confidence to take on new challenges in their search for real and rewarding jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will take some time to fix the mess left by 13 years of Labor, for which, I remind the House, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) must recognise and accept his fair share of the blame. The real social and economic problems caused by high rates of unemployment will not be solved overnight. The Howard government has already implemented many reforms, such as scrapping Labor's job destroying unfair dismissal laws, which will lead to the creation of real job opportunities for those who seek work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the meantime, we must do what we can to provide real hope and practical assistance to young unemployed Australians. The work for the dole project will help to instil the discipline of the workplace and help break the cycle of unproductive activity, isolation and health problems that many young unemployed people experience. Support for the project has come from many quarters, including the young people in my Makin electorate. Students from Salisbury East High School recently wrote to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). They have provided me with copies of their letters. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="4752"><TITLE>Industrial Relations</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) covers the Australian Horticultural Corporation Act 1987. The reference to this is very minor. It reduces the size of the board, which I think is probably a good thing. It is certainly going to limit costs. I hope grower representation is maintained. Too often on these boards the interests of growers are subverted when the nominees come from agri&hyphen;political bodies which have long ceased to have much relevance to the welfare of the grower or primary producer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to AQIS, the bill gives the power for AQIS to license people meeting its standards to certify things for export. It is my view that self&hyphen;regulation in this area is fraught with danger and is probably not in our long&hyphen;term interest. Having said that, it is quite clear that something has to be done about the extraordinary cost imposed on exporters by AQIS. A lot of this has to do with AQIS's regulations and rigmarole, which are designed to enhance its income rather than expedite the processing of exports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I could go into great detail about what I see as the shortcomings of AQIS in this regard. Like a lot of other countries, we should forget this nonsense of full cost recovery. AQIS should be seen as an adjunct to Australia's exports. It should be impressed upon it that its job is to help exports, not to hinder them. I believe that, in the long run, self&hyphen;regulation will not be the way to go. Some people in this parliament will remember the meat scandals which were a direct result of corruption in the process of certifying meat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed amendments to the Social Security Act covered by this bill will allow the recovery of drought relief overpayments that were paid to farmers through a variety of mechanisms. This is interesting. In my view, the drought relief paid to farmers was not very substantial, it was extremely hard to get, and overpayments in this area would be minimal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I am cynically amused that we are prepared to enshrine in legislation the methods of recovery from farmers, yet we will not do the same thing in respect to some quasi&hyphen;government bodies such as housing authorities where there was an enormous demand from people to have their rents taken out of social security payments&mdash;particularly, I might add, from the Aboriginal community. We simply do not do it, and this is to the detriment of government bodies such as the Aboriginal housing corporations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In other areas, such as the payment of Abstudy, John Dawkins very foolishly took this payment away from schools and gave it to individuals. That means that schools no longer get the money. I took this matter up with the previous government. As I have said so often in this House, there is really no difference&mdash;we are dealing with Tweedledum and Tweedledumber&mdash;and this government refuses to act on it as well.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4757">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under this agreement, imported food from New Zealand will be inspected&mdash;if it is inspected&mdash;at point of sale, not at point of entry. This is part of our agreement with New Zealand. One cannot help but become increasingly cynical about our trade agreement with New Zealand. We are told that, on balance, we export more to New Zealand. This is a nonsense when you think of the other advantages New Zealand gets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suspect that the transfer of money to New Zealand runs in excess of $2 billion a year from New Zealanders working in Australia. There is very little flow the other way. Of course, with the deregulation of the banking system under Keating, we simply do not know how much money is leaving the country but, quite clearly, it is substantial. In the long run, I suppose we can be big brother to New Zealand: the problem is when governments want to make us big brother to the rest of the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me now move to the amendment to the Moomba&hyphen;Sydney pipeline legislation dealing with the transfer of easements. The Commonwealth maintained an interest in the pipeline easements primarily to ensure that other people could use the easements. The Commonwealth has now decided that the demand is not there but that it will enshrine guarantees for other people to use the easements. I think that is all very reasonable and sounds like commonsense. I do not see how you can sell the residual share in the easements and, at the same time, enshrine provision for other parties, as yet unknown, to use these easements. Certainly, I do not know how you can do it without dramatically reducing the money that you were going to get from these easements. While I very strongly support other people having access to those easements at very reasonable costs, it is my experience that governments tend to like money so if the government can work that out it will be for the better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to talk a little about the treaty between Australia and the Republic of Indonesia in respect of the zone of cooperation. I was probably the instigator of the original Timor Gap treaty when I took Mr Brian Conway to see the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Bill Hayden. The argument at the time was that Australia had made what could only be described as an enormous land grab&mdash;which would not have been upheld in any international court&mdash;by taking our land claim virtually to the border of Timor. It was my view that it would be much better if we could get an agreement with Indonesia for a mutual area where we could jointly exploit it. That course came to fruition. I believe that Bill Hayden deserves the credit for that and not Gareth Evans. Unfortunately, it is unlikely that history will be written that way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have had a few letters from people claiming that Australia's sovereignty is being sold out. That is an absolute nonsense in this regard. I think it is being sold out every day in other respects but I believe the treaty signed with Indonesia on the use of the surrounding seas is in fact very much in Australia's favour. It must be said that the department has done a good job in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to mention the AQIS function. The government is here seeking to increase penalties for the introduction of sea organisms in the bilge water of ships. We have already seen such organisms introduced into Australia and it is an ever present threat to us. Even with this bill, I am not sure that we are doing enough to ensure the security of our shores. There is a reasonably stiff penalty in there but I very much doubt that it can be policed adequately. I would like to see some better system of policing. I also point out that the demise of cabotage, and the entry of foreign ships into our coastal waters, is an additional threat to Australia. In the long run, we might see any short&hyphen;term benefit in cost vastly outweighed by the threat to our environment.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4758">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also find it a little unsettling to hear the member for Mayo (Mr Downer), the present Minister for Foreign Affairs, talking in the parliament today about our international commitments. One feels that there will be a tendency to water down all forms of protection under pressure from GATT or our current masters in the United States, and I think that this is a very dangerous thing&mdash;if it is possible that quarantine measures are in fact a non&hyphen;tariff protection measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it is my view that we cannot be too careful with quarantine measures. If we are seen by foreign countries as using this non&hyphen;tariff protection measure, so be it. I would rather live with that than have the problems that we could inherit if we were to slacken our quarantine vigilance. This is a crucial point for Australia. One has really to consider the cost to us as a nation if, through laxity or mindless government adherence to some treaty that other nations tend to honour much more in the breach, we suffer losses in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I tried to introduce into this parliament a private member's bill making the government responsible for such occurrences when industry suffers losses but, as a private member's bill, it did not go anywhere. I certainly think it would be incumbent upon the National Party, if it still represents rural Australia, to consider such a bill to make the government responsible for any mistakes that occur through laxity in our quarantine regulations.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997 that the government has put forward, it is pleasing to hear that we have the support of the other side. We are debating this issue in the Main Committee, because it is non&hyphen;controversial legislation. I will explain to the Main Committee some of the amendments, because our agricultural sector is obviously a very important industry not only from a jobs perspective but also from a national economy perspective.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have received some industry criticism in relation to the Australian Horticultural Corporation Act 1987 that the cost of participating in the Australian Horticultural Corporation, the AHC, is too high. I confirm to the Main Committee that the Australian Horticultural Corporation undertook a review of its overhead costs in relation to this criticism. As a means of reducing overheads, the AHC proposed a reduction in the size of the board membership from nine to seven and a reduction in remuneration for the board. The AHC is certainly aware of the criticism and is trying to address some of those concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to point out that the Australian horticulture sector is an increasingly important sector to the agricultural and rural areas of Australia. Horticulture is already a major domestic agricultural industry but has a much lower export focus than that of most other agricultural industries. In 1995&hyphen;96, Australia's horticulture industry had a gross production value of about $4.2 billion. The total value for fresh and processed horticultural produce in 1995&hyphen;96 was over $1 billion. With changing consumer tastes, including a growing interest in health and lifestyle issues, there will be an increased demand for horticultural produce in the foreseeable future; hence the importance of the amendments to the Australian Horticultural Corporation Act 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the Export Control Act 1992, the proposed amendments to section 23 will enable non&hyphen;government persons specified by the Secretary to the Department of Primary Industries and Energy to issue certain certificates required for export. This will enhance administrative efficiency and ensure that the persons signing export documentation under
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4759"> quality based arrangements can be properly regulated. These amendments will be used, for example, in the implementation of quality schemes in the horticulture industry&mdash;where it is proposed that certificates, such as certificates of condition requested by certain overseas governments, will be signed by company management&mdash;and in the organics industry, where it is proposed that industry associations issue organic produce certificates attesting to product quality. As I mentioned, with changing lifestyles and the increasing focus on healthy food, this is certainly also another step which will assist that industry in identifying and certifying the quality of the produce.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) raised the issue of the changes to the Farm Household Support Act 1992 and the Social Security Act 1991. The Farm Household Support Act provides for overpayments of drought relief to be recovered as a debt due to the Commonwealth but does not specify the means by which these debts are to be recovered. The amendments will provide the mechanism by which drought relief payment debts can be recovered, thereby maintaining equity with other social security payments such as the newstart allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed amendments to the Social Security Act 1991 will allow recovery of drought relief overpayments through a range of mechanisms that currently apply to specific social security payments not currently including drought relief payments. The drought relief payment has been an extremely invaluable source of money for families hard hit by drought. Of course, coming from a rural constituency that has been hit with five years of drought, I know just how welcome it has been for our farming constituencies. However, I know, and the farming constituencies know too, that we need a fair system and that where there has been an overpayment these moneys have to be recovered by the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These changes really will mean that the recovery mechanisms that will be made available include deductions from future drought relief payments or deductions from social security payments. I think they certainly agree with that process. It is about a fair system and the farming constituency acknowledging that the government is trying to help by making these arrangements as flexible as possible in relation to the recovery of those overpayments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment to the Imported Food Control Act 1992 will enable Australia to fulfil our obligations in respect of the agreement reached with New Zealand that food safety and food standards are equivalent between the two countries. The amendment will allow for the Governor&hyphen;General to make regulations that give exemptions from the Imported Food Control Act for certain foods of New Zealand origin. This means that for public health concerns those foods will be treated as if produced here and subject to point of sale rather than point of entry inspection. This amendment has no effect on Australia's quarantine requirements or practices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are also amendments in relation to the Moomba&hyphen;Sydney Pipeline Systems Act 1994, the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967, the Sea Installations Act 1987 and the Quarantine Act 1908. To refer to one other point raised by the member for Kalgoorlie in relation to the Sea Installations Act, he contended that the foreign ships participating on our coastal routes may be detrimental to our national interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me assure the member for Kalgoorlie that that is not the case. I think he will find that when we get more competition on sea routes around our nation we will have a far more competitive environment, one which is far more conducive to making sure that our industries in Australia are internationally competitive. It will mean that we will be able to make the most of the opportunities that present themselves in the international markets.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget and Simplification Measures) Bill 1997 has two main elements. Firstly, it seeks to integrate into the social security system most child related payments to veterans' families. Secondly, it attempts to simplify the current rate calculation provisions of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The plan to integrate into the social security system child related payments to service pensioners and income supplement recipients was announced in last year's federal budget. It seeks to ensure that from 1 January 1998 almost all child related payments will be the responsibility of the new Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency, which is due to take over the payment role of the Department of Social Security from July.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous federal government inherited from the Fraser government a complex, poorly targeted and mean system of family payments. That system included family allowance, additional benefits for pensioners and beneficiaries, and the family income supplement for the working poor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the families package, these separate child related payments have been integrated into a single family payments system that is targeted towards low&hyphen; and middle&hyphen;income families. That recognises the additional costs of caring for older children or living in private rental accommodation. Just as importantly, the families package ensured that family payments to low&hyphen;income families were linked to a benchmark of adequacy that entailed indexation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1993, the Social Security Act was amended to integrate child related payments to pensioners into the family payments system. This bill seeks to achieve the same outcome for veterans' families with dependent children. The aim is to enable social security officers to become more of a one&hyphen;stop shop for family payments, reducing the need for families to have dealings with separate agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If handled effectively, such an objective has much to commend it. To achieve this outcome, and with one important qualification, this bill effectively transfers responsibility for child related payments to veterans' affairs income support recipients from the Department of Veterans' Affairs to the social security family payments system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To ensure that no family will be worse off financially as a result of the change, the bill includes an important savings provision. This provision preserves the payment by Veterans' Affairs of child related payments such as the dependent child add&hyphen;on, the pensioners full rent assistance, and the guardian allowance, where a pensioner or recipient would otherwise be
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4761"> disadvantaged by the transfer. The opposition welcomes this safety net provision, which ensures that there will be no losers from the measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second major element of the bill seeks to simplify the present rate calculation of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. The two elements are linked because the transfer of child related payments to Social Security requires amendment of existing rate calculators. The current rate calculation provisions in the act extend to some 110 pages, and entail six separate rate calculators and nine separate method statements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you were to believe the title of the media release issued by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) on 27 March 1997, it is a case of the minister cleaning up his act!</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="SCOTT" NAMEID="YT4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8T4">Mr LAURIE FERGUSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;However, before the minister rests too heavily on his laurels, it should be noted that on the most optimistic assumptions this bill will probably reduce the 865&hyphen;page Veterans' Entitlements Act by a comparatively modest 80 pages. The minister's second reading speech indicates that this is the first instalment in a staggered review of the act to redraft it along `plain English' lines. The opposition supports such a redraft and seeks clarification from the government of the timetable and process that are to be applied to the project, and the resources devoted to it in an environment where the department's staff levels continue to fall.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Turning to the specifics of the rate calculators, there are at present six&mdash;one for each of the following categories: service pensioners with children; service pensioners without children; service pensioners who are blind; service pensioners on frozen rate; income support supplement recipients with children; and income support supplement recipients without children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill seeks to replace these separate calculators with a single rate calculator, but one that contains seven modules and involves six overall rate calculation processes, all of which largely mirror the existing processes. This highlights the complexity of this crucial aspect of the legislation, resulting from incremental decisions that have been made over the years to make exceptions of certain situations. I well understand that in complex systems there often needs to be a trade&hyphen;off between the objectives of simplicity and clarity, on the one hand, and equity and fairness on the other. As a result of changes to the rate calculators, the bill also introduces consequent changes to the Aged Care Act 1997 and the Aged Care Income Testing Act. These are simply housekeeping changes that make no change to existing entitlements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition does not oppose the provisions of the bill dealing with the rate calculation process, but wishes to flag an anomaly or two that require attention by the government. A particular anomaly that has been brought to my attention by a range of veterans' groups concerns the impact of disability pension payments on rent assistance to service pensioners. This is something that is directly relevant to the rate calculation aspects of this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is bipartisan agreement that disability pensions, being compensation for war caused injury or illness, should not be counted as income for taxation or veterans' affairs pension purposes. The only exception to this at present is that, under the act, where a service pensioner also receives a disability pension, the rate of their disability pension reduces the rate of rent assistance payable. Where the pensioner is receiving a high percentage of disability compensation, this can completely extinguish their access to rent assistance. This provision appears to be a relic of an earlier period when rent assistance for pensioners was generally subject to a separate income test. Separate rent assistance income tests have been removed
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4762"> from all other parts of the social security and veterans' affairs systems, except for those in this situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some may argue that people receiving both a service pension and a disability pension would be receiving an adequate total income and can therefore do without extra allowances like rent assistance. To me, the difficulty with this argument is that it means that a dual&mdash;that is, disability and service&mdash;pensioner living in private rental receives no more assistance than someone who is a home owner. After all the work produced by the national housing strategy and by other studies as part of the housing reform agenda, I would be surprised if any member would argue that private renters do not face particular financial difficulties, particularly in large cities such as Sydney, but elsewhere as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also point out that the returned service community rightly receives financial assistance from the government under the defence service homes scheme, in the form of a mortgage subsidy paid out of the Veterans' Affairs budget to Westpac, to assist them to become home owners. It is only right and proper that this should be so. To my mind, however, this subsidy only strengthens the argument that veterans who are struggling in the private rental market warrant extra assistance towards their housing costs, even where they receive a dual pension. I acknowledge that the situation I am raising has been in place for many years. Nevertheless, I believe the minister should try to address it when the opportunity arises. I doubt that the cost involved in disregarding disability pension income for rent assistance purposes would be particularly large. It has been suggested to me that it would cost about $9 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I mention in passing the opposition's strong concern at the impact on veterans of several measures in the recent budget. We will be taking the opportunity to highlight these concerns in future debates in this chamber and in the Senate. I indicate support for the current bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It always astonishes me that whenever the government does something good, the opposition gets up and says that it is not good enough. They never acknowledge the fact that we have only been in government for a short time and that, in that short time, a great deal has been achieved. Not many ministers have achieved as much as the honourable Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) who is in the Chamber today. The purpose of this bill, which is his bill, serves to finalise the amendments to the budget simplification bill 1997 to give effect to the coalition government's budget for Veterans' Affairs as contained in last year's budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The intention of this bill is to facilitate the process for the income support recipients by having them dealing with only one Commonwealth department in order to establish their entitlements to child related payments as a result of the integration into the Department of Social Security's family payment of the child related payments made to Veterans' Affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be no reduction to the total amount of Commonwealth payments made to the family unit and there will be absolutely no negative financial result on any income support pensioner or payee. The changes contained in this bill will go a long way to providing a plain English version of the Veterans' Entitlements Act and, through simplified rules that are easily comprehended by veterans and the community at large, the coalition government is delivering on our commitment to streamline public administration through a more efficient service delivery. This is pretty much a general housekeeping bill and I am pleased to support the bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset can I put in an apology in this debate for my friend and colleague, the shadow minister for science, the member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans). Regrettably, he has come down ill this afternoon. He did want to make some comments in the course of the debate on the Industry, Science and Tourism Legislation Amendment Bill but, as I have suggested, he will be unable to do so. I indicate from the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4765"> opposition's perspective, however, that we do not see any controversial elements contained in this bill, which at the end of the day simply changes in a whole variety of very minor ways the way in which this act operates. Accordingly, we will certainly not be opposing it and we do not, as I have said, suggest it is in any way controversial.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill seeks to amend a number of acts administered under the portfolio responsibility of industry, science and tourism. The Australian Science and Technology Council Act of 1978 is amended to add the council's functions and to reflect the addition of the term `engineering' to the name of the council. Appointments to this council will be made in future by the minister responsible, with the approval of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), rather than the Governor&hyphen;General.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only thing I say about that is, of course, that we would like assurances, and I am sure the minister will be quite prepared to give them, that those appointments are from a carefully selected and culled group of individuals, that ministerial discretion reflects that the best possible people are appointed and that there are no other reasons why people should be appointed to that particular organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will come back to the tourist commission in a moment. The National Measurement Act of 1960 is similarly amended, requiring the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation to maintain, or cause to be maintained, coordinated universal time as determined by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures. The amendment will ensure that measurements are made on a consistent basis throughout the nation and are compatible with measurements in other countries. Again, this is a very sensible thing to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Science and Industry Research Act 1949 is to be amended to remove section 9AB from the act consistent with the current restructuring of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. The Bounty (Machine Tools and Robots) Act 1985, the Coal Tariff Legislation Amendment Act 1992, the Patents, Trademarks, Designs and Copyright Act 1939, the Resource Assessment Commission Act 1989 and the Trade Marks Act 1995 are similarly to be amended to make a number of technical amendments in these pieces of legislation which are, again, non-controversial and therefore supported by the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Tourist Commission Act 1987 is to be amended to remove the requirement that the members of the board of the commission cease to hold office at the age of 65 and that the board not employ persons on terms and conditions more favourable than those of the managing director, and that is probably a very sensible thing to do. Finally, the Australian Tourist Commission (Transitional Provisions) Act 1987 is to be repealed as it no longer has application.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have indicated, Mr Deputy Speaker, the opposition does not oppose any of this legislation. However, in connection with the Australian Tourist Commission Act 1987, permit me to make some very brief comments generally about tourism which I seek your indulgence to do. In particular, what I am concerned about and what I think the Australian tourism industry is concerned about are the number of difficulties now being caused by some of the comments, some of the perceptions, and certainly by some of the newspaper reporting, of the activities of the One Nation Party and the honourable member for Oxley (Ms Hanson).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A couple of weeks ago I was in Brisbane as part of my responsibility as the shadow minister for tourism and I met with a number of people from the Brisbane Chinese community. These were Hong Kong Chinese Australians and Taiwanese Chinese Australians and they raised with me their concerns&mdash;particularly from a tourism perspective&mdash;about the effect that the One
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4766"> Nation Party's philosophies, and the comments being peddled by the member for Oxley, were having on tourism.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They cited as an example the fact that something like 40 tours from Taiwan, with an average of about 30 people on each, had been cancelled. They said the reason advanced for those  cancellations was that there was a perception in Taiwan that Australia was no longer a welcoming country, a welcoming destination. I think that is absolutely abhorrent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tourism is now our second, and very close to being our first, major source of export revenue. Even this government has recognised that it needs to put some of the money back into the ATC which it took out in last year's budget and so it has put another $5 million in the 1997&hyphen;98 budget. This is in recognition of the fact that we are finding that the damaging debate in this country, with its racist overtones, is damaging our tourism industry. That is just one example.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I therefore found it quite interesting that in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Telegraph</EMPHASIS>, a Sydney newspaper, on 1 June this year, there was a comment piece by Sarah Harris under the heading of `Passing the tourist buck'. I thought it was absolutely fascinating to read this. As you are a regional member from Victoria, Mr Deputy Speaker Reid, and I note also that there is a regional member from Queensland present, I think that this is an article to which your attention should be drawn.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It talked about the operation of a Victorian tourism proposal and it said:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I acknowledge the confirmation by the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), in leading for the opposition, that the opposition will not be opposing these amendments. As the member for Cunningham has just stated, the Industry, Science and Tourism Legislation Amendment Bill 1997 is of a non&hyphen;controversial nature. It amends 10 acts administered in the industry, science and tourism portfolio: the Australian Science and Technology Council Act 1978, the National Measurement Act 1960, the Science and Industry Research Act 1949, the Australian Tourist Commission Act 1987, the Australian Tourist Commission (Transitional Provisions) Act 1987, the Bounty (Machine Tools and Robots) Act 1985, the Coal Tariff Legislation Amendment Act 1992, the Patents, Trade Marks, Designs and Copyright Act 1939, the Resource Assessment Commission Act 1989 and the Trade Marks Act 1995.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments to the Australian Science and Technology Council Act 1978 add the field of engineering to the council's increased responsibilities. Additionally, delays in appointments to the council will be greatly reduced by the direct appointment by the minister, with the approval of the Prime Minister, instead of the present system of referring appointments to the Governor&hyphen;General, with all of the delays that that has incurred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of the other amendments are straightforward and of a non&hyphen;controversial nature. However, I want to make passing reference to the repeal of two subsections of the Australian Tourist Commission Act 1987&mdash;specifically subsection 14(3) and 42(3). The repeal of subsection 14(3) removes age restrictions to the continuation of appointment after the age of 65. The repeal of subsection 42(3) will allow those employed by the board, in particular those who are employed in overseas offices at sufficiently high remuneration to live in some high cost of living countries, to earn a higher salary and conditions than those of the Australian managing director, for all of the obvious reasons. I support the amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a general housekeeping bill which is quite extensive, covering&mdash;as I said earlier&mdash;some 10 different acts. It is important to note that some of these acts go back to 1949; some, to 1960; some, to 1987; and some, to 1985. They have all been overtaken by certain&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I am glad of that interjection. I would speak on all of the 10 different acts. The procedures for making appointments to the council, as I said earlier, are very important in that the previous arrangement required the Governor&hyphen;General to make the appointment. As we know, the wheels of government turn slowly and the Governor&hyphen;General had to ensure that those nominated had the approval of the minister and of the Prime Minister. That caused a great deal of delay in the appointments. As a result, a great deal of time was wasted.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I owe some appreciation to the member for Lowe (Mr Zammit) for a very mild filibuster. The amendments in the Industry, Science and Tourism Legislation Amendment Bill 1997 are, in themselves, not important but they give me an opportunity to say something which I think is perhaps fundamental. The fact that they are brought together from various parts of legislation, affecting various areas of government responsibility but all coming under the minister for industry, is very pertinent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is about time we started to understand what we mean by industry and industry policy. Rod Cameron of ANOP made a very interesting speech last week to the minerals conference in Canberra, in which he pointed out that the current assessment that he has made of his own work and some work on behalf of the minerals industry suggests that people in Australia are extremely concerned about the perceived absence of industry policy. In the chamber, day after day we have been debating these questions about industry policy. It is important to start talking about what that actually means.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some who think industry policy is a way of giving cash or some handout to business. There are some who think that one writes a monumental manuscript of enormous length and detail, spelling out how every industry should work. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard), in some smart remark the other day, referred to a 10&hyphen;year plan. A lot of people feel that somehow there has to be a single, discrete thing: complex, detailed, and totally prescriptive. Perhaps one day it may be that; I have never known it to be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Industry policy in a modern Western society is the accretion of a whole range of forces: many negative, many positive. It also involves a mind&hyphen;set and an understanding of what industry is actually about. The idea that taking away the regulations, taking away government and taking away so&hyphen;called red tape and letting business get on with being in business will somehow produce some coherence is&mdash;quite frankly&mdash;fanciful. The idea that out of chaos comes order is not very logical. An industry policy first requires an understanding of what the drivers are and what the forces at work are. The forces include competition, government, cost, innovation, commitment, and an understanding of how the bits fit together&mdash;how the ingredients actually work together.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4769">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When one looks at the effect on investment of, say, depreciation and then starts to hear how Treasury for so long has talked about depreciation as being a form of business welfare, one can start to see why this country might have a problem. That problem arises from the fact that people deal with the fragments discretely on one hand and yet they talk about them as if they are coherent, and on the other hand the alternative they argue for is a prescriptive, detailed and punitive system.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Order! I am having some difficulty in following the member's contribution on this debate, which is a very narrow one particularly relating to repeal of subsections in tourism legislation and changes to bounties. It is probably not appropriate for a wide ranging debate on industry policy as such. I ask that the member contains his remarks to a more narrow focus on this particular legislation.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FI4">Mr ALLAN MORRIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The point that I am trying to make to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, is that this is industry policy being made right now in narrow, prescriptive, detailed little ways across four or five pieces of legislation which in fact project and give an attitude and affect things. For the last 15 months the government has been changing bits and pieces all the way through&mdash;or doing nothing at all. That, in itself, is making policy. That in effect is actually doing something.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am suggesting that what these amendments to the legislation indicate is of no great consequence. The fact is that they have been brought forward in bits and pieces, in dribs and drabs and fragments all over the landscape; the whole industry and commercial landscape is littered with bits and pieces. Whether they be computer bounties, shipbuilding bounties, or R&amp;D tax write&hyphen;offs, they are bits and pieces which are, in fact, making a substantial policy change to this country. More importantly, they are making a substantial change to the attitudes and mind&hyphen;set of the people out there, both in the community and in business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the government, in effect, is making policy even by these minor technical amendments. I urge the House, and you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to understand the significance of what is actually happening in this period. The decision of the government that it will not have an industry policy per se means that the industry position you have is an unconscious and fragmented one that is failing. If people in the community think that there is no industry policy and the people in business think that there is no industry policy, then a country without industry policy obviously does not want industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what the government in effect is doing through this process is dismantling what was a reasonably healthy attitude towards industry on all sides&mdash;by the work force, the employment community and the investment community. I am trying to put on notice that this House, this parliament and this government will some day have to face up to the fact that this is not the way to approach issues; this is not the way to run things. It is not appropriate to bring together five or six technical amendments and say that these are inconsequential and we do not discuss and debate them, so that the country and industry are run step by step, brick by brick, tile by tile, across some mosaic of which no&hyphen;one can see the picture in advance and no&hyphen;one can see it afterwards. You are building a picture with mosaics. These little pieces are changing the landscape. They are changing the scene and no&hyphen;one knows how, least of all the government.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4770">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My concern is that that approach is doing this country great damage and I think that if you ask your community you will find that people will say the same. If you ask your business people about their confidence in this government's industry policy or in its approach to industry you will find the same conclusion. This is not the way to run a country and it is not the way to run industry policy.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As all members know, the Industry, Science and Tourism Legislation Amendment Bill 1997 amends a number of acts administered by the portfolio of industry, science and tourism. As has been acknowledged by one speaker after another, the changes are not controversial and are mostly technical in nature.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Several of the proposed amendments implement important election commitments given by the government in the area of science, engineering and technology. For example, we have maintained our commitment before the last election to change the name of the Australian Science and Technology Council to become the Australian Science, Technology and Engineering Council&mdash;a very important and symbolic change which has been welcomed by the Institution of Engineers and by the engineering community in general. The Australian Science, Technology and Engineering Council is a very significant source of independent advice on science, engineering and technology policy. The amendments to the Australian Science and Technology Council Act 1978 implement this important name change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has also sought to implement a number of changes to improve the effectiveness of the CSIRO, consistent with our recognition of that research body having a leading role in Australia's technology and industry development. Overcoming structural impediments to focus on key research products was a primary concern. Changes proposed to the Science and Industry Research Act 1949 reflect the new administrative framework developed by the review of CSIRO's management structure and performance, and put in place the government's objective to facilitate greater flexibility in CSIRO's structures and research programs. I am glad to say that that new structure is working particularly well.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a number of telling comments in the Spicer review into the migration agents registration scheme. One key finding says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in the absence of regulation, the market for migration advice has tended to operate imperfectly with consumers bearing unacceptable cost in terms of exploitation and inappropriate practice by a sector of the industry; . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">More importantly, another key finding says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that the Scheme has provided a measure of consumer protection and . . . its credibility as a consumer protection mechanism has strengthened somewhat in the time since the Joint Standing Committee on Migration (JSCM) conducted a review of the Scheme; . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Essentially, there is an admission out there that this is one industry that needs a significant amount of regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would be the first to admit that the organisation that, in the long term, the government sees as having some role in self&hyphen;regulation&mdash;the Migration Institute of Australia&mdash;is a reasonably reputable association. It has structured meetings with the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs three times a year; it has conducted training courses; it was involved in the Roach inquiry; and, indeed, it is an organisation that we do not have too many criticisms of. It has even received grants from the government to develop a practical training course.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality, as the other part of the quote says, is that there is an industry here in which we see very desperate people and we see some very crude sharks in the market who very much are on the ball essentially to exploit these people, whether by claiming refugee status when they have got no bona fides in the world, by launching spouse or de facto relationships when people have not even got the required cohabitation, by having people already in bigamous relations purporting to remarry et cetera&mdash;you go along the train of claims. Many times it is essentially aimed at buying time in Australia, once they come here and overstay, to develop a relationship with somebody during their period of fighting this refugee claim.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to say, on the other hand, that, whilst there is a need to supervise those kinds of operators in this industry, the reality of life is that you often have people in your electorate, constituents, who have been just as involved in this conspiracy. They want to buy time, they want to rort the Australian system and they are out here to overstay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The inquiry, titled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Protecting the vulnerable</EMPHASIS>, by a joint committee of which the current minister was a member, came down in favour of a number of recommendations. They included the continuation of the then scheme for three years, a review at the end of that period, continued registration of lawyers&mdash;which was a fairly controversial measure and which was upheld in the courts of this country, despite the views of lawyers&mdash;individuals not being required to register if they worked for voluntary organisations and training modules for migration agents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also suggested something which this government should do, and which was suggested to the previous government; and that is to close the longstanding loophole that advice to sponsors and nominators is not covered by the provisions of legislation. As I say, it should have been undertaken by the previous government and it is more than necessary to be undertaken today
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4772"> because it is a major loophole where those who are in malpractice in this field ignore the needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That unanimous inquiry, which wrote to all 1,450 then registered agents, received 65 submissions, had witnesses from major sectors of the industry, such as the department, the Ethnic Communities Council of New South Wales, immigration advice centres, the Law Council, the Migration Agents Registration Board and so on, and came to a number of conclusions. Amongst them were the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principal issue is not whether the advice is paid for or is provided free of charge, but whether consumers, particularly those who are least able to shop around for advice, should be able to expect accurate advice from competent advisers, and whether they should be able to access appropriate avenues of redress should the advice which is provided prove to be negligent, inaccurate or dishonest.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The committee furthermore, at XXVI, noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One particularly invidious outcome&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">and I have just mentioned it&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">of the omission&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is, of nominators and sponsors&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is that persons who have been found to be unqualified or unfit to practise as migration agents can circumvent the scheme by directing their practice through sponsors.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The parliamentary committee furthermore noted at 2.20, on page 9:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to the above, many requests for immigration advice arise from persons who are not in a position to advance adequately their own cases or the cases of family members. Applicants may lack an adequate command of English, or may not comprehend the requirements for making immigration applications. Such applicants may be unable or unclear about how to best advance their cases. Applicants from different cultural backgrounds might not understand the processes and the statutory requirements relating to visa applications.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">At 3.82 the committee came to a unanimous summary of the then prevailing situation in the industry and in the regulation of those agents. It noted at page 61:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Statistics obtained by the Committee support a finding that achievements of the Scheme relevant to its objectives have been chequered. On the positive side, around 600 persons either have been denied the right to practise as migration agents or have decided to withdraw from seeking entry to the industry. In addition, the avenues for developing expertise in migration law have increased noticeably, with various courses and seminars now being conducted at a tertiary level and within the industry itself. On the negative side, disciplinary action taken against migration agents has been minimal, even though the number of complaints in relation to registered and unregistered practice has been increasing over time.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I want to put on the record at this stage that that is certainly a very clear weakness of the current scheme. There are doubts out there as to the way in which people can be pursued and, I guess, an unwillingness by many people exploited to come forward because of the reality of their situation. I have got to express some early doubts that self&hyphen;regulation is going to essentially do anything about that aspect&mdash;the most significant aspect of the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We might be able to bemoan the question of cost to the users in the field, we might be able to make a number of other criticisms of the scheme as it currently operates but, fundamentally, I believe the most important aspect of this is to rid the industry of these people, dissuade them from participation and, whether people like to hear this or not, penalise them and throw them out of the industry if necessary. I do not think that that most crucial aspect of the problem that the committee itself noted is going to be tackled by self&hyphen;regulation.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4773">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is an admission by the Spicer inquiry&mdash;and this is why we have got a situation here today where the legislation is being extended until next year&mdash;that the industry's main organisation, which I have earlier indicated is one which we can largely have respect for, is not in a situation where it can claim to be representative of the industry. Its membership is rather small. I think the last figure was 2,200 people registered. There are some major players that are members of the Migration Institute of Australia. There is talk about banks, even voluntary organisations and corporations, and there are probably some practices in this field which are members, but a significant part of the industry is not involved in the institute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Spicer inquiry says that at this stage it is incapable of policing the industry. That is why the government speaks about the concept of statutory self&hyphen;regulation as an interim measure in their move towards self&hyphen;regulation. The minister notes agreement with this analysis of where they are at but, on our side of the debate, we do not have the confidence that he has that the ability might be there within the next six months.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Sorry, 20 years time, is it? The minister is conceding that they are, as he says, incapable at this stage of conducting self&hyphen;regulation&mdash;and I take his point. The situation, as the Spicer inquiry noted, is such that there are quite a few remaining problems in the field. As a person who has consistently questioned the degree of influence of various lobby groups on our migration policy, I want to say that I think we went to the other extreme in the Spicer inquiry. I notice that one of the members of the inquiry had some involvement with Careforce, but I thought the balance was too far in the other direction if we look at the membership; it had a significant preponderance of practitioners. At the end of the day, regardless of one's analysis of them as individuals, you would have to ask whether there was a degree of self&hyphen;interest in moving the government out of the field, moving the administration out of the field and thrusting towards self&hyphen;regulation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not saying for a moment that there are particular errors or particular weaknesses in the inquiry but, as I say, I think I have a reasonable track record in not wanting these kinds of organisations to be dominated by FECCA or by some immigration advice centre. But, if one were to analyse the make&hyphen;up, one would perhaps say it had swung too far in another direction. The inquiry did make a few pertinent points that are important for the future, regardless of whether there is support eventually for self&hyphen;regulation. I think its point No. 11, on page 5, is accurate and should be taken on board regardless of the direction this country goes in. It notes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there has been inadequate promotion of the current Scheme and, in whatever arrangement replaces the current Scheme&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">or, for that matter, if the current scheme continues&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">an ongoing consumer information strategy, targeted in particular to members of non&hyphen;English speaking background communities, needs to be developed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is indicative of what I said earlier. I think there is a lack of knowledge out there of what to do if people feel that they have been ripped off or even if the people they go to feel ripped off. There is a lack of knowledge and a lack of confidence perhaps that, at the end of the road, they will be getting success in pursuing people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Spicer inquiry also noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that in a deregulated environment, consumers in the migration advice industry would not be able to rely solely on the remedies available to them under consumer protection legislation and have in fact failed
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4774"> to take action to any significant extent either in the courts under the consumer protection provisions of trade practices legislation or in the States and Territories small claims tribunals.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So they are putting on the record something that is in evidence: that there is a relative lack of successful prosecutions, and many people&mdash;as we noted earlier&mdash;have been dissuaded from moving into the industry. But that does not mean that there are still not a number of people who perhaps, with more knowledge in the field and with more determination, might have been pursued.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have concerns that with a reduction in the support of various advice centres by the government in the 1996 budget, these people that we are supposedly trying to tackle and supervise and to rid ourselves and the industry of, are going to be encouraged. There is no doubt that the significant reduction in support by the government of people who are doing this kind of assistance on a voluntary basis only opens up the field in a more obvious way to those who wish to exploit people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation, as on a previous occasion, is an extension by this government of the currently operating provisions. And I want to mention again that unanimous report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Protecting the vulnerable?</EMPHASIS> which made a number of significant suggestions as to the better operation of the supervisory section of the industry. Some of those suggestions were not taken up by the previous government; others which were taken up, in the view of the Spicer inquiry, essentially improved the situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The summary position is that we do have here a field that allows people who have come from societies where there are repressive regimes lacking the rule of law, where people have no knowledge of the court system, where they have fears of police and of police institutions, to feel more confident. We are saying to these people that they should know their rights straightaway. They should know that they have to be very thorough in the way they deal with people offering advice to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not the reality that people have out there. They are extremely desperate on many occasions and see their only option as being the person they have been led to by family or friends or, more often, that person who advertises very heavily in particular ethnic media and who sometimes has the support of institutions within the ethnic community as being their basic salvation and way of staying in this country. They are, as the opposition notes, very vulnerable and they should be our primary responsibility and we should not adopt an attitude as to how we should regulate this industry on the basis of ideological bent. We should have doubts about an industry which, at this stage at least, in the view of the Spicer inquiry is not capable of operating without very major improvement. It should get more people involved, have more membership, and reach a stage when it really can say that it represents the industry. Until that happens, I think that we have really got to question whether the next stage of this process is in the interests of those people that we say are most vulnerable. One of the recommendations of the Spicer review stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in the interests of developing a cohesive industry with consistent standards, mandatory registration as migration agents continue to apply to legal practitioners.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is an important point that the joint committee in its past review strongly supported, regardless of their feelings of self&hyphen;importance and their desire not to be covered by regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point that the opposition would have some concerns about is the resourcing of this regulation. It is not just a question of eventually handing it over and being hopeful that things will basically scrabble through and that they will be able to do it through their own
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4775"> resources. The opposition supports the extension of the current legislation, believing that, on balance, it has had major accomplishments, that it has kept a lot of people out of the industry who should not have been in it in the first place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation has had some measure of supervisory oversight so that perhaps people will be more reluctant to exploit others. It has probably accomplished that in the area of fears about moving the charges too heavily. It has, in some cases, removed people from the industry and essentially, at the end of the day, it has a motivation which is beyond the self&hyphen;interest of those people who seek&mdash;supposedly in the long&hyphen;term&mdash;to regulate themselves. I commend the bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1997 provides for a six&hyphen;month extension to the migration agents registration scheme under the Migration Act 1958, given that the present six&hyphen;month sunset clause would see the scheme terminate on 21 September this year. Extending the scheme to 21 March 1998 will initially allow for the introduction of statutory self&hyphen;regulation as a transition stage before the eventual introduction of full self&hyphen;regulation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Migration Institute of Australia, a relatively new industry body, will have time to establish the necessary structures to take on this self&hyphen;regulatory role of over 2,200 migration agents now operating. Disciplinary sanctions including removal of the right to practise are expected to form part of the industry based self&hyphen;regulation. There will also be specific complaints resolution processes to protect vulnerable members of our community and aspirant members who use migration agents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's plan to move progressively from the current scheme to partial supervised deregulation and eventually to industry self&hyphen;regulation will enable the government to support and work with reputable agents and allow this peak body to develop standards and self&hyphen;regulatory systems and procedures, picking up on the comments of the member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Two years ago, the Joint Standing Committee on Migration in its report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Protecting the vulnerable?</EMPHASIS> delivered some mixed findings on the operation of the scheme which had only been established in September 1992. When the then government introduced the scheme, they rejected self&hyphen;regulation because of a claimed high level of fragmentation in the industry. The creation of an industry peak body since then is an important step in ensuring that migration agents are more able to speak with one voice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I found it interesting that the joint standing committee's report suggested that it was difficult to determine just how many visa applicants sought the advice of migration agents. An Immigration Rights and Advice Centre telephone survey suggested that three per cent of callers specifically sought guidance on alleged wrong advice or the checking of other advice from migration agents. However, the complexity of migration legislation and regulation, the extent to which people compete for places, and an applicant's inability to advance their own or their family's case are other factors pushing them towards migration agents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The joint standing committee criticised the generally low level of public awareness of the scheme, as has been mentioned by the member for Reid. The scheme has also not fulfilled its aim of becoming self&hyphen;funding. On a more positive note, the committee noted that 600 people had been stopped from practising as migration agents. This demonstrates that the provision of migration advice is an imperfect market and that the current regulatory system still enabled shonks to get a foothold in some cases. The then Refugee Review Tribunal commented that `many agents are ignorant of the regulations' and that `submissions are little
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4776"> more than legal nonsense.' The Immigration Review Tribunal commented that in 1993&hyphen;94 the proportion of successful applicants was the same, whether or not a professional adviser was used.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The self&hyphen;regulatory regime will bring forward the self&hyphen;interest of reputable agents to ensure that vulnerable potential migrants are not exposed to incompetence, dishonest and exploitative practices from people offering migration advice to the discredit of legitimate, competent and qualified professionals working in the field. Last time I spoke on this subject, I suggested that migration agents were people who were proffers of hope. They sold the hope and the prospects of coming to our country as a key ware that they had to offer for their payments. That just highlights the importance of protecting people who turn to these advisers in the hope that they will improve their prospects and chances of migrating to our great country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed changes in the bill follow an internal review by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. The task force took advice from a group of independent experts chaired by Mr Ian Spicer, former chair of the Australian Chamber of Commerce.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One recent example brought to my attention is of a visitor to Australia who liked the place so much he wanted to stay. He must have been visiting the electorate of Dunkley; it is a wonderful place. A migration adviser in a regional centre, which I will not mention&mdash;not far from Dunkley&mdash;advised him to apply as a refugee. He said that he was not a refugee in any sense of the word, but he followed the advice he had been provided for his $3,000. Clearly, he was rejected and now forfeits any credibility when applying in the future on more legitimate grounds. I cannot begin to tell you how much he laments taking the advice that was offered to him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also leads to the question of lawyers, and I am pleased to see that lawyers are being brought within the scope of the program. It is not a question about whether they are charging more than $1.20 per photocopy page or those sorts of things. It is an important specialist area where very much  they are providing advice on hope. Just as migration agents need to ensure that they understand the program, so must lawyers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Going back to that earlier comment, pure legal nonsense is not a way of getting through the system, notwithstanding the considerable sums of money that are often paid for very poor advice. I am sure the member for Reid and other colleagues in the committee room are aware of the number of people coming into electorate offices all around the country looking for help after they have paid good money to migration agents only to find that they have sent them up the wrong track.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very encouraged by what the minister is doing and I would like to pick up on some of the points that the member for Reid has mentioned. We seem to be in heated agreement over this. We seem to agree that there are doubts over whether the present system as it is is working effectively. We share that view, and we also share the view that the current system has been inadequately promoted and that there is a lack of knowledge about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unlike the member for Reid, I do not believe there are doubts over self&hyphen;regulation at this time because of the way the minister is going about this particular transition. What he is saying in the first instance is, `We'll supervise a partial self&hyphen;regulation, where the minister can delegate the authorities to the institute, and see how it goes.' We can learn from the experience. The minister is there to provide advice and support over time as the institute&mdash;again as the member for Reid says&mdash;develops and matures and gets up to speed to be a fully competent peak body for the industry.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4777">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting that the member for Reid referred to some papers on the free advice that is provided to people seeking to migrate to Australia. My view is that, wherever you are getting your advice from, the consumer still deserves protection. I certainly would encourage the minister and the institute to consider including voluntary organisation in the work of the institute as we move into this partial self&hyphen;regulation regime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason I say that is that I have many people coming to my electorate office seeking our assistance after they have spoken with an ethnic community organisation outlining perhaps how they should go about seeking to apply to enter our country. Often that advice is not accurate. Often that advice has led to people from my part of the world being very up&hyphen;beat and very positive about their prospects without really seeing how they measure up against the criteria of the migration program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In some way, I would certainly encourage the minister to ask the Migration Institute of Australia to take in some of those organisations, both in the development phase of the systems and procedures that it is putting in place in preparation for self&hyphen;regulation and also to see whether there is a way of ensuring that those community organisations, and others offering free advice&mdash;out of goodwill more than anything&mdash;are at least fully informed of what is going on and are not providing false hope to people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also would ensure that the consumers that we are seeking to protect can be involved in the development of those systems and procedures as, once again referring to the member for Reid's comments, the institute gets up to speed in preparation for self&hyphen;regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will not add a lot more than that, although I did have some rather interesting facts on the changes that the government has made to the migration program, why I believe the changes are very much for the better, and why I believe the measures the government has put in place have built confidence in the migration program and, to some degree, have made it a little more complex, thereby increasing the need for competent advice to people wishing to apply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In closing, it is clear to me from reading this report and from my very vague understanding of the career of the member for Reid in this place that he has something to offer. I certainly encourage him to put forward his ideas and to make a positive contribution to what the minister is trying to achieve. He should let the Australian public and aspiring Australians benefit from the obvious understanding and insight he has on this subject. The opportunity is there in this supervised delegated regime that the minister is overseeing to ensure that the particular systems and processes, the checks and balances that need to be put in place, are developed and are in place as we move towards industry self&hyphen;regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the bill to the House, congratulate the minister on his continuing good work in a difficult place, and invite my colleagues on both sides of the House&mdash;including the boisterous member for Reid&mdash;to make a contribution where possible to the development of a self&hyphen;regulatory system.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1997 extends to 21 March 1998 the sunset clause of the migration agents registration scheme, which was to terminate on 21 September 1997 after having operated for five years. It is for that reason that the opposition supports this bill, and for that reason only.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This move is in preparation, from the government's point of view, for statutory self&hyphen;regulation for a transitional period, with a proposed move to full self&hyphen;regulation of the migration agents industry. My view of self&hyphen;regulation can sometimes be characterised as giving
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4778"> the blood bank to Dracula to look after. Unfortunately, Australia has seen some disappointing results from self&hyphen;regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition recognises the limitations that exist in a globalised market whereby migration agents who operate solely offshore are not subject to regulation in the same way that Australian&hyphen;operating migrant agents are. However, we also need to recognise the inherent contradictions and limitations that self&hyphen;regulation imposes, particularly in a market that even Mr Spicer has described as less than perfect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Spicer is not known, from my experience, as someone who is an ardent opponent of self&hyphen;regulation&mdash;indeed, he has often been at the forefront of running arguments supporting self&hyphen;regulation. In this instance, he is encouraging us to be fairly cautious, and I think that is the prudent course for those who support self&hyphen;regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For my part, I have some very serious concerns about the proponents of self&hyphen;regulation in this industry in particular. For instance, the government has articulated concerns about the potential for abuse of the spouse provisions of the migration regulations. In fact, these concerns have been cited as justification for cuts to the migration program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill raises questions about how, at the end of the day, the government will be able to control the level of fraud in the marriage program, for example. If the government is really serious about stopping fraud in the marriage categories of the migration program, it would need to ensure that the method of regulation&mdash;self&hyphen;regulation or otherwise&mdash;is effective, not only on the fraud issue but&mdash;and from my point of view this is a more important issue&mdash;the level of the exploitation of the applicants involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One view is that, because of the complexity of migration law, it is unrealistic not to give applicants the ability to obtain professional advice about how to maximise their chances of lodging a successful migration application. The previous speaker suggested that voluntary organisations should be included in the scope of the current debate, but the facts of life are that they are already covered by the scope of the current regime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They already have competency standards and they compare very favourably with private providers. However, in the absence of adequate funding being provided so that the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs can perform that function&mdash;and I note that the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs has sustained pretty tough cuts this round&mdash;the government needs to ensure that whatever regulatory regime is imposed or is adopted, whether it is self&hyphen;regulation or otherwise, is effective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This arises essentially out of the complexity of migration law. We have accepted in this debate, prima facie, that migration law has to be complex and we have then progressed down the road about how migration advice may be provided. I suggest there is another course which bears some thought and that is the degree of complexity that migration law actually requires.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cost of migration applications is very high. There is the cost of applications, and a person may require further advice about migration law from migration agents. We need to really ensure that people are getting value for money in terms of accurate and lawful advice from migration agents and that that advice is fair dinkum. More importantly, we need to ensure that people who apply for migration to Australia do not have their expectations falsely raised about their chances of lodging a successful application, bearing in mind that this is an industry where people make profits out of other people's hopes and expectations.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4779">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have heard stories recounted today, which are consistent with this line of argument, of examples of genuine asylum seekers to this country who provide vast sums of money to agents in order to lodge applications for refugee status. Many of these people appear to have been told by unscrupulous agents that their claims will have a greater chance of success if they enter Australia through the back door, that is, come to Australia as a tourist and then lodge a claim for refugee status whilst in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Someone who is desperate to escape an oppressive regime does not always have the time or inclination, capacity or resources, to sit down with immigration officials to determine the best way of proceeding. In these cases we need to ensure that asylum seekers do not arrive with false expectations of their claims being recognised simply because they have been encouraged to put up a large sum of money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members might remember that I spoke yesterday of the problems encountered by workers on the Mandir Society's temple which was opened in Canberra last weekend. I commented in the media last Sunday on this situation where workers are brought into the country and their rights as workers are breached. In that instance the workers were paid an appalling rate of 51c an hour, contrary to the undertakings that the sponsor made to the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. They were not paid superannuation, they were not paid proper allowances, they had inadequate safety protection, there was inadequate fall protection, if any, and there were no first aid kits on site, and so on and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs was advised, but the sponsor was able to bring out more workers. The department allowed this circumstance to take place even though it knew that this blatant exploitation was taking place. Clearly, there needs to be a little bit more guts applied in some of these circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know whether, in that particular case, the workers were brought out through a migration agent, but that is not the point. There have been documented cases of people who have been brought out and basically their rights have been totally ignored.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I am pleased to have this opportunity to sum up in relation to the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1997. I thank the members for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson), Dunkley (Mr Billson) and Fraser (Mr Dargavel) for their comments. As the member for Reid has left, I will come back to his remarks. I will pick up those of the honourable member for Fraser instead, in case he intends to leave.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me deal with the issue on which I interjected, because it is a very important question. I am sorry if I missed some remarks you made yesterday in relation to this matter. It is the usual practice, if you wish ministers to be aware of your remarks, to indicate&mdash;perhaps by a call to the office&mdash;that you intend to raise something and then they might be in a position to follow it up quickly with you. Being now apprised of your remarks, I will have a look at the question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me also say that I have spoken with the construction union on a number of occasions during my consultations. While general issues have been raised with me about the need for efficacy in processing skilled applicants, either through employer nomination or under the other alternative arrangements which we have where there are tripartite labour market agreements for people to be able to enter Australia to work in particular situations, I understand the union's reticence and desire to protect conditions and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not about using the migration program as a basis for undermining conditions here in Australia. All I would say is that at no point in time was I aware of the particular claims that you have raised in relation to the temple development here in Canberra. I do not recall that matter having ever been brought to my attention and, I suspect, if it had been, it would have been something that I would have noted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I simply make the point that my department is in a position to act in relation to visas granted on particular conditions, if we are apprised of the fact that breaches are occurring. There are certain natural justice provisions that have to be followed, and you do need to put before people the assertions that are made; and people need to stand up and say that somebody is not being properly paid, so that we can put those matters properly before them and deal with them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason that we have to follow that course is very simple: it is because of the administrative law that operates in this country. In relation to the rights that people obtain through the issue of a visa, we are not in a position to simply terminate the visa without following the natural justice principles of putting allegations that are made before people, for them to have an opportunity to correct them if an error has been made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That brings me to the second point of substance in the honourable member's contribution that I wanted to pick up, and that was in relation to the complexity of the migration act and
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4781"> regulations. I do not think it is generally understood why we have an act that is so complex and so difficult&mdash;</PARA>

I have an understanding of how this arose under your predecessors. Senator Ray was the person who essentially got in place the present act and regulatory regime. This was modified through the reform act that followed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We moved to introduce the statutory scheme that we have in place today because we had seen develop over time a situation where the previous largely discretionary regime was no longer capable of operating in this area. This was largely because of the operations of administrative law. The courts had essentially taken over the determination as to who was going to enter Australia and who was not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I frequently draw to people's attention and put before them an interesting article written by a former immigration official, Evan Arthur. He made it clear that we were going to have 14,000 onshore applications on strong and compelling compassionate grounds under the guidelines that have been developed for interpreting that provision, which was section 6A(1)(e) of the old migration act, by the courts when the matter was largely left for them to define what those words meant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former government was not of the view that the immigration program should be dominated by people who had entered Australia on the pretext of being a visitor, simply managed to run a reasonably good story and then been able to stay in Australia. The view was that if people wanted to apply to come here they should apply offshore and wait their turn. Ultimately the statutory regime we had with the very limited discretion that ministers now have&mdash;the non&hyphen;compellable discretion&mdash;was to ensure that the government of the day was able to administer the program as it had planned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You made some observations about asylum seekers. I would like to say that it is a vexed issue about which I could speak at length. I am certainly concerned to contain the abuse that is occurring in relation to asylum claims but I do so in the context of a determination to ensure that no bona fide refugee should be rejected. I recognise that some people's circumstances might be such that they will go to extraordinary lengths to get here. They will pay people. They will forge documents. They will mislead me as to their intentions. But it is because of their vulnerable situation and the claims have to be examined on that basis. That is the obligation we have accepted. My officials understand that and that is why we provide the opportunity for review independently by the Refugee Review Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I challenge the members of the Labor Party in relation to some of the proposed changes that I will be initiating during the course of these parliamentary sittings in relation to the issue of judicial review. We have already a very significant litigious load. I am probably the most sued minister of the Commonwealth at the present time. There was an expectation that when we put in place independent merits review that people would get out of the courts. It has not happened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that the courts are involved has led to significant changes in the way in which people are able to enter Australia. It has removed a lot of the decision making from the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4782"> government of the day. I will be proposing a mechanism whereby we can again get control of the immigration program for the parliament and for the government of the day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That will be done through a privative clause which will ensure that the only matter that the courts will be able to examine is whether or not the people who take the decisions&mdash;at first instance, my department and the merits review system that we have in place&mdash;are legally competent to take the decision. That will considerably narrow the range of issues that we take into the courts and upon which the courts can turn their very creative minds. It will lead to a situation where the act may not have to go through the many contortions that it now goes through to deal with some of the very elaborate approaches that are taken by the courts in dealing with this act in particular cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To come back to the bill that we are dealing with, the bill is to extend the sunset clause. If the sunset clause is not extended, the present statutory scheme collapses. Let us understand it&mdash;it collapses and then there will be no scheme. We are proposing an alternative; one that has been developed as a result of a review undertaken by my department; one that was the subject of advice from a reference group of very eminent Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I accept the comment of the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Dargavel) that Ian Spicer was a person who normally would be a gung&hyphen;ho deregulator. He was a member of the reference group. Other members of the group included Pamela O'Neil, a former member of the Labor Party and a very distinguished agent for the Commonwealth in a variety of roles; Ian Tonking, a Sydney barrister and a specialist in trade practices matters, particularly in relation to consumer affairs issues; and Cheryl Webster.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson) asked some questions about Cheryl Webster. I have known Cheryl over a long period of time. She works as a grant&hyphen;in&hyphen;aid worker for Careforce, which is part of the Anglican Home Mission. I do not think that in any way disqualifies her. Madam Deputy Speaker, the Anglican Home Mission society has worked amongst migrants and refugees in your electorate over a long period of time. Cheryl is a person of great personal quality and one who can contribute and did contribute significantly in relation to this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other members of the group are John Hodges, a former minister, and Pauline Matthewson, a prominent member of the Migration Institute of Australia. It was a very balanced group and its advice was very helpful. It was not an ideological issue. It was a matter of addressing the work of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Reid took us through the committee's report very helpfully, but I remind the member that I was on that committee and I am very much aware of its recommendations. The committee was of the view that self&hyphen;regulation should be looked at. The reason that there was a sunset clause and it was continued was that this was an option that was always to be kept open.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee recommended in 1995 that the migration agents registration scheme should continue to operate for another three years with a range of improvements, and that at that stage it should be reviewed so we could look at these further models. Self&hyphen;regulation was one of those that was held out. We are operating largely within that time frame.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to recognise that what we are proposing is a form of regulatory self&hyphen;regulation. In other words, there will be amendments to the act to establish that the Migration Institute is the body that will be undertaking the supervisory role. It will be in accordance with
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4783"> its code of ethics. It will administer a scheme in which peer pressure will establish, hopefully, the highest order of supervision and standards for membership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think those people who are ethical and who are involved in the Migration Institute will be anxious to ensure that the higher standards are upheld. My expectation is that they will work with legal practitioners. They have already indicated to me that they will sit down with the Law Council to look at ways and means of integrating their different approaches to the question of supervision. I expect that they will be able to work together in the way in which this particular scheme is developed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank particularly my colleague the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Billson) for his very supportive observations. I think they were far too generous, and I speak with a degree of experience in relation to that. I know my own weaknesses but I nevertheless thank him for it. Let me say that voluntary organisations will be included in the regime. We fund a number of organisations now for the purposes of providing advice, and that is important. We expect that those people who are offering free advice through voluntary agencies ought to be the subject of supervisory arrangements. They will still be able to be registered. They will not have to pay a fee and they will not have to necessarily satisfy the same comprehensive knowledge test.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things that I am very supportive of is the work that is undertaken through our universities and through a number of the voluntary organisations that we fund to provide tuition, if one might put it in that form, for people who want to be migration agents. We have a number of programs now that are leading to a better trained work force in this area. That applies not only to agents but to the legal profession. It is an area of some complexity and difficulty, and one where specialisation is very important today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank honourable members for their support for this legislation. Obviously, my officials and I will take on board all of the comments that have been made. We are in the process of drafting the legislation now and obviously there may be a much more comprehensive and vigorous debate when we see the substantive legislation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In continuation of my earlier contribution, I remind those present that I spoke glowingly in support of the Child Support Agency Legislation
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4784"> Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996. I spoke about it as being a humanising and responsive change so that people's real lives could be better integrated with the systems and procedures of the Child Support Agency. This is achieved by providing an opportunity for income estimate elections to better reflect the non&hyphen;custodial parent's capacity to pay and, as a result, to reduce the likelihood of custodial parents having to refund overpayments. It will reward reliable payers of child support by allowing for their employers not to be involved in the arrangements where they have a satisfactory track record of paying. It also provides for the Family Court to take into account private arrangements amicably entered into when making property and spousal maintenance orders.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I spoke about the bill as being a welcome first step in ensuring that the law supports and encourages the sort of desirable behaviour we hope for where a relationship is no longer viable and there are children left behind who need to be cared for. I mentioned a number of further reforms that I believe warrant consideration, and I sought to encourage the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) and the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) to constructively contribute to the diligent work that many of us in this place, under the chairmanship of the member for Grey (Mr Wakelin), are doing in trying to deal with many of the challenges facing the community, involving relationship breakdown and the care of kids.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to those opposite: resist the temptation to be petty and pathetic as the coalition government seeks to deal with the recommendations that remain from the joint select committee report on the child support scheme and other, quite numerous, constructive ideas that have been brought forward by the coalition members working in conjunction with the member for Grey.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say that for the kids' sake. This is about making sure that the kids get the support, care and input from willing parents towards their development into young Australians and great citizens of this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of things which I mentioned in my earlier contribution that simply seek to ensure that the system encourages all parents to do the right thing and to reward them for it, and to discourage behaviour that is unhelpful or contrary to the care and development needs of the child. That is one of the great dilemmas that I have with some of the provisions and arrangements that the Child Support Agency operates under at this time: they seem to actually discourage people from doing the right thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The person sitting in your chair on the last occasion I spoke, Madam Deputy Speaker, allowed me to use the term `the stuff it option'. That is what far too many of my constituents say to me when they come to see me, in despair about the impact that the Child Support Agency regime is having on their lives. Too many people are saying that it is easier just to throw their job in and not put in to the community but to put in to their own care needs and, as a result, not to provide anything in the way of financial assistance for the care of the  children that they helped to create. It is disastrous that people are seeing that as a viable alternative to being a constructive and willing contributor to the development of their children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should view the Child Support Agency in the first instance as a fallback option where less intrusive and light&hyphen;handed regimes are applied to people who voluntarily go about doing the right things out of interest and care for the child. The Child Support Agency arrangements need to be interventionist, intrusive and quite prescriptive for people who are not doing the right thing. But to apply those sorts of regimes to people who are doing the right thing is a very sad mistake.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4785">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In closing, there are some issues that I would certainly encourage those in this place to consider. The first is to foster greater cooperation between the Child Support Agency and the Family Court. I spoke briefly about it in my last contribution, and I encourage all of us here to put our minds to that. The second is to try to work out a way of encouraging non&hyphen;custodial parents to go that extra yard to do the overtime or take on that second job, to try and repair their lives at the same time as making a contribution towards the care of their child. How can we do that? There are some good ideas around and we need to work through them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I welcome the interest of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in this matter. I am certainly encouraged by the vast number of coalition members that are very serious about trying to leave an improved Child Support Agency as a memento of our first term in government. I commend this bill to the House and I ask those present, when they are thinking about the Child Support Agency, to think about changes that are there for the sake of the kids.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pleasure to follow the member for Dunkley (Mr Billson) with his well&hyphen;chosen comments on what has been a long running issue for the parliament and, indeed, for the nation. The Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996 has been in the parliament for some time. It was introduced into the House on 6 March 1997 and referred to the Main Committee on 18 March 1997.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose of the legislation is, firstly, that custodial parents will not have to refund overpayments but, instead, future payments for the year will be reduced commensurately; secondly, that non&hyphen;custodial parents will be able to make their payments directly to the CSA, rather than through an employer; and, thirdly, that the Family Court, when making property or maintenance decisions, will be able to take into account future liabilities under the Child Support Act, even if an assessment has not been made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No doubt the details have been well canvassed previously in the debate. I will not go over old ground, but I will pick up some of the points that the member for Dunkley has made. There is a great challenge for the parliament to improve the child support scheme. It is not just about the administration of the CSA, because that is symptomatic of a deeper issue, in my opinion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The child support scheme has a history of at least two decades. It goes back to the changes to the Family Law Act of Attorney&hyphen;General Murphy in the Whitlam era, right through to the mid&hyphen; to late&hyphen;1980s, when the child support scheme was introduced with the Child Support Agency. Although the Child Support Agency has seen a doubling of the number of parents who are contributing to the care of their children&mdash;that is, from about 30 to 35 per cent to about 70 per cent&mdash;that still leaves 30 per cent of parents who are not fulfilling their responsibilities to care for their children. So there is much work left to be done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues has been well quoted over the last 2&half; years that it has been before the parliament. Many of its recommendations have been  introduced, but there is still much work left to be done. The underlying philosophical base whereby parents have the responsibility to care for their young&mdash;in the case of the child support scheme, to the age of 18&mdash;is at the heart of this issue. The tendency not to rely sufficiently on private arrangements, as they have become known, and the tendency for the DSS to refer people readily to the CSA seem to be issues which the parliament should consider.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is pleasing to see that the member for Chifley (Mr Price) has introduced a private member's bill. I know of his deep interest in this matter and of the commitment that he, as
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4786"> chairman of the joint select committee, and those across the parliament made from about 1994 onwards. I am sure that the response that they received from the public and the work that went into it must have left an overwhelming impression on those members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Chifley continues his long&hyphen;running interest in this issue. I remember him commenting to me&mdash;and I am sure he would not mind me saying it&mdash;that too much of the focus of the child support scheme is on the corpses of dead relationships. That was a profound comment that I will never forget. The need to look forward from those failed relationships, certainly those that have children resulting from them and yet do not survive, is a key issue for the new government. That is, the new family, whatever its format, has to be considered as much as those children who remain in the previous family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The child support scheme has great difficulties, I believe, in that it falls within at least three portfolios: Social Security, Assistant Treasurer and Attorney&hyphen;General. It is quite a job to try and bring those portfolios together to focus on this issue. There has been well&hyphen;documented, or at least well&hyphen;discussed, opposition from within the public sector and from within areas of the Department of Social Security to any change, because they believe that they have got a formula that works. Certainly it has worked somewhat better than the system in the old Family Court days. But in the opinion of many, as the member for Dunkley (Mr Billson) has mentioned, and certainly from the government side and from the back bench, there is a view that it should work a lot better. There is plenty of potential for it to show great improvement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issues of inconsistent advice from the CSA still are constantly surfacing. There is a range of issues that I do not think I will canvass here tonight, but that the committee I have the good fortune, or otherwise, to convene is in the process of discussing. What we need to realise is that this is not a gender issue. This is an issue about fairness for families. It is an issue about the private responsibilities of parents. For it to become some kind of gender contest defeats the whole notion of the responsibility of the adult community to children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I do not think this is an issue that we can afford to allow to become a partisan contest. It is essential that all parents take their responsibilities to their children with the utmost care&mdash;and that, I am sure, the overwhelming majority do. The responsibility of the government is to support the principle of supporting those parents who put their children as their number one responsibility. It is not prudent for any government to have a situation where the social welfare system, the court system, or any other system undermines that fundamental responsibility of parents to their children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you consider that we have gone from virtually zero employees employed by the Child Support Agency to about 2,400 people, at a cost to the taxpayer of something approaching $130 million for an agency that has the role of saying that parent A shall pay parent B for the care of their children, you have to ask the fundamental question of whether the pendulum has swung too far. The bipartisan acceptance of this legislation is one more small step in the  improvement of the child support scheme. However, there is much to be done and I look forward to playing my part in that. I support the legislation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to speak on the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996. Since the establishment of the child support scheme and the Child Support Agency in two stages&mdash;firstly, in June 1988 and, secondly, in October 1989&mdash;the results have been mixed with many cases bordering on frustration at a time when emotions run very high. The issue of child support is one of particular interest to me because of the large number of constituents in the Petrie electorate who have had a marriage break&hyphen;up
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4787"> and who are directly involved in a case in the Child Support Agency or are affected through independent maintenance payments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the most frustrating things that I find in my dealings with constituents and the Child Support Agency is that every case is so very different. Every case deals with people who have emotions, who have different needs and different circumstances, and they need to be looked at on their individual merits. The Child Support Agency seems to have a number of loopholes which have led to great consternation and distraction in the maintenance settlements. It is important that we, as a government, take the time and effort which is necessary to sew up these loopholes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to listen to our constituents on these issues and we need to work through the problems for the betterment of the whole community at large. A point that needs to be made when we are dealing with the child support scheme is that each case can be terribly time consuming. As I have mentioned, the issues are complex and like any situation there are always two sides to a story.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The child support scheme deals with the rights of the child. The rights of a child should always be foremost and we need to look at that very carefully. The belief is that when children are involved in their parents' divorce the children must be protected, and they must have a sustainable, great quality of life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I expect that all members of parliament in their day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day dealings with constituents would receive similar complaints on this issue. The main areas of concern for people tend to be on issues such as custodial parents not receiving maintenance, and repetitive or conflicting letters received by the paying parent. Many constituents have also raised with me the complexities and the concerns relating to the percentage system in deducting the level of child support to be paid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I acknowledge that in any system that exists there will always be people who are trying to find holes or ways around it, there seems to be, in the case of child support, plenty of community discontent and a strong push for change in this area. I believe it is important to acknowledge, on behalf of all the people in Australia who are affected by this, that there are a number of huge concerns with the Child Support Agency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a member of the government, I believe that amendments to the legislation are absolutely necessary to assist custodial and non&hyphen;custodial parents and must be given absolute priority at this time. We must look at flexible legislation being introduced into this House that tries to amend some of the inequities which presently exist and look at ways to ensure that the system works well and works with people instead of against those whom it was originally intended to assist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The system must work for both parents. It must work towards providing an amicable and timely maintenance delivery as well. It must work for custodial and non&hyphen;custodial parents in  such a way that the administrative procedures do not supersede positive results. The government is aware of some of these problems with the child support scheme and, as the previous speaker, the member for Grey (Mr Wakelin) mentioned, it is working towards that. I am happy to say that I am a member of the committee looking at reviewing this legislation and it is looking at some of the ways that we can fix some of the problems of the past. The child support legislation amendment presently before the House addresses a number of discrepancies, many of which arose from the recommendations of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues, which was also mentioned by the member for Grey.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4788">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the time available to me tonight I want to speak to a number of these amendments. Firstly, I wish to make a couple of points in relation to the amendment dealing with the consideration of child support liabilities in property and spousal maintenance proceedings. This amendment has important ramifications for those parents who voluntarily pay maintenance as presently the Family Court does not take this into consideration when making property and spousal arrangement judgments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been many who have felt that the system has failed them because property arrangements have not been taken into account when child maintenance payments were made, or that future circumstances were not taken into account. In essence, as a result of the amendments, custodial and non-custodial parents who have private arrangements will be treated exactly the same as those parents working under the guidelines as specified in the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989. This amendment ensures far more flexibility. Maintenance cases can involve property trusts and other assets, and the level of child support should be taken into account in those proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment also gives some forward thinking to the legislation. The legislation will now take into account private arrangements for child support and give opportunities to take into account potential liabilities under the child support scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A further amendment deals with employers who withhold child support from an employee's pay packet. I note that, according to the explanatory memorandum for the bill, nearly 30 per cent of those who pay child support have arranged their circumstances such that the payments are withheld by their employer. This amendment adjusts this situation and gives the option for far more flexibility for those who wish to pay child support straight to the registry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Through this amendment the payer of child support will have far more independence, and the intrusiveness which they may have felt in the past will be diminished. In some cases the employee may not wish the employer to know of their previous personal history. Administration, paperwork, and compliance costs to employers are also expected to be reduced by this move.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I do acknowledge that there are cases where the payer may default in payments. The amendment covers these instances with a trigger mechanism which results in the employer withholding the relevant amount of child support in those cases. Those who default will cause employers to withhold payments and they will have very limited future access to this procedure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation also allows for payers to appeal if their application to pay directly is rejected by the Child Support Agency. A further advantage of this would be to reduce the cost to employers of administering the child support payment from their employees' wages. Most businesses do not object to complying with this but they do object to the terrible impost placed on them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A small business operator recently contacted me detailing the cost to him of collecting child support on behalf of the Australian Taxation Office. It was absolutely horrendous. The administrative costs included cheques, bank charges, stationery, postage and computer processing. For this particular company, when all those costs were taken into account, it amounted to $12.36 per week per employee, which totals $642.72 per year.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just imagine the enormous savings that can be made to private enterprise, and to the government as an employer, if those who pay child support can opt to make their own arrangements.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4789">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of other amendments in the bill also in reference to the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 which bring them into line with references to the Social Security Act 1991. These are necessary for continuity and consistency. On the whole, the legislation acts as the first step in the federal government's process of reviewing the whole child support scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure that both sides of the House can support this process to streamline the child support legislation. I believe it is really important that we have support on both sides for this legislation and that we work towards ensuring the benefits for both parties involved. The Child Support Act does have problems and there are some great concerns out there, but this government is making a major commitment to fix those problems.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not intend taking up too much time, because what I have to say and the sentiments that I have about the child support scheme have been expressed by those who have already spoken in the debate on the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that over 80,000 Australians have signed petitions pertaining to child support and the Family Law Act is indicative of the animosity in the community in relation to both these laws. Of all the issues brought to my attention by my constituents, there is none more voluminous, and none which causes more emotion and grief, than that dealing with child support and family law. I am certainly not envious of the minister responsible for the Child Support Act, the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp). To have responsibility for that and for superannuation is a double&hyphen;whammy poisoned chalice, if I can put it that way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill being debated makes changes to certain aspects of the child support scheme. The objective of child support is certainly justified, as we have all noted. The child support scheme came into effect in 1988 with the objective of requiring both custodial and non&hyphen;custodial parents to pay for the maintenance of their children rather than leave it to the taxpayers&mdash;who are, too often, expected to provide for all the needs of so many people in our community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the objective is certainly worthy, to put that objective into legislation is a difficult task by any means, as we have discovered over the years. There is no way that, on issues such as child support and family law, any parliament would be able to provide legislation which is suitable to all people. Nevertheless, as a member of parliament, you do hear of cases which make you wonder how our laws allow to take place certain practices that, at the end of the day, ultimately affect not the parents but the child, who is always the innocent victim in such disputes&mdash;although that point is quickly forgotten.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first change provided by the bill allows a non&hyphen;custodial parent to seek a revision of their payments owing, if they believe their income is less than 15 per cent of the previous year's income. This will, of course, amend the non&hyphen;custodial parent's child support assessment. If a custodial parent has received an overpayment, this bill will allow them to receive reduced  payments accordingly until the ledger is balanced, so to speak, rather than having to pay back the overpayment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One child support case that I had brought to my attention dealt with the matter of a non&hyphen;custodial parent overpaying the custodial parent. Apparently the Child Support Agency wrote to the gentleman offering three options: reducing payments until the overpayment was offset; taking a payment from the CSA of the equivalent of the overpayment; or giving the payment to the custodial parent as a gift. I thought that final option was a misnomer, given that the parents obviously had irreconcilable differences which had brought them to the situation that
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4790"> they were in. As such, it was not surprising that the non&hyphen;custodial parent did not take up the final option.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While this amendment is welcomed, it will still leave many clients of the Child Support Agency quite dissatisfied. The theme of many complaints to my office is in relation to the assessments made by the CSA, and the fact that the information used for the decisions affecting their assessments does not reflect the actual situation that the non&hyphen;custodial parent is in. People ask me why, when they are earning X amount of dollars, the CSA assesses them as though they are earning Z amount of dollars. I hope that this amendment will provide the relief that those people require who are earning less than they are assessed as earning, notwithstanding their obligations to their child or children. That is the paramount point. I only say that because I know that I will still have people coming to my office complaining about their assessments and the facts and figures used to calculate them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second change effected by the bill is to allow non&hyphen;custodial parents to make their payments direct to the Child Support Agency rather than have them deducted from their pay and forwarded to the CSA by their employer. This move is consistent with other legislation that has come before the House, such as the Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill which allowed the parent's child&hyphen;care payments to be paid directly to the child&hyphen;care provider. This reduces the intrusiveness into what is essentially a private matter between family members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the non&hyphen;custodial parent chooses, there is no need to require the employer to deduct pay from a non&hyphen;custodial parent for forwarding to the CSA. The previous situation implied that the non&hyphen;custodial parent could not be trusted to make payments to the CSA and that the payments should be compulsorily deducted from their pay beforehand. This is a logical amendment that I am sure non&hyphen;custodial parents will find completely welcome. They know that they have a responsibility for the upkeep of their children, and the vast majority will not shirk their responsibility and will continue making their payments personally, without the intrusion of a third party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My principal concern is that the CSA pass the payments on punctually, which is but another topic of complaint that I receive about this particular subject. The final change deals with potential child support liabilities when the Family Court is making decisions on property or maintenance. In closing, I would like to read to you a letter which I received on 29 May, which is so typical of letters that I receive concerning this particular subject. Obviously, I will leave my constituent's name private. The letter reads:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am writing to ask you to raise the issue of child maintenance in parliament, specifically to amend the laws of the Child Support Agency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before I begin let me state that I want to support my family and I know it is right that I should do so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My situation and many others I have spoken to about this subject is: I earn around about $30,000 a year working from about 80 to 100 hours a fortnight; I am living in a rented duplex, I drive a 30 year old car  and I'm BROKE. Though I live a mangy, pitiful existence I am expending a little more every fortnight than my net income; and you know what the means.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After accounting my expenditure which includes just normal everyday bills with the exception of tithing I pay to my church&mdash;which is tax deductible&mdash;I am left with about $3000 for the year for buying clothes, entertainment, birthday/Christmas presents for the kids and the mother/wife, little luxuries like haircuts and medication which cost me about $300 to $400 a year and a variety of miscellaneous things. I have a personal loan for a computer which is $70 a fortnight, the rest as I have said is just living costs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I dream of one day buying a house and starting my life again. I would like to buy another car to replace the one that is breaking up around me. If I found another companion I would like to be able to keep her. I would like to think
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4791"> that I am getting ahead and moving forward and maybe having the benefit of joying in some little reward that I can give myself for supporting my family and paying my taxes and doing the right thing. But in sad reality, I can not. And the cruel hard fact of the matter is, I never can. If I work overtime or work myself to near death with one or two other jobs to get ahead then bang, I am hit with a greater child support bill the year after.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most importantly is my relationship with my children. I have lost the benefit of watching my children grow up and having them around me as a family. Now it's twice a fortnight I have my kids sleep over. I would like to be in a position to compensate for my separation from the children, on the days that I see them by taking them out and spending a little money on them and supporting them directly instead of indirectly. When my rostered days off come around and I have my kids over I have very little money to do anything but feed them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This situation leaves people to either give up to the extent they want to give up; Go on the dole; Earn undeclared cash money or turn to criminal activities to get ahead. This I cannot do and why should I have to resort to immoral or illegal activities to live?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">If I cannot afford to pay petrol or maintenance costs for my vehicle then I have no alternative but to cease work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Or if the physiological impact of being separated from the family, working in a stressful job and then having nothing to show for it but the worry of mounting bills, poverty and bankruptcy; if this anxiety and sorrow causes a break down then, what is the advantage in this? I would cease paying tax; The government would be obliged to pay my sickness/unemployment benefits and completely supporting my wife and kids.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Isn't it better that I am working and paying tax and willing to help support my children?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now in the name of equality I would like to mention my wife and her charmed life. She is buying a house</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">in a suburb of Perth&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">she drives around in a late model van, it appears that she can buy clothes for herself and go out whenever she wills, and she has the added benefit of having the children with her and buying things for them and taking them out etc, which I think is great; I am happy for her and I am grateful the kids have a good home to live in and a loving mother to look after them. My humble prayer is not to have what she has but at least have half the benefits and joys and opportunities that she has. At the moment I have zilch, zero, naught, nothing. The simple fact of the matter is, it isn't fair.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So for this reason I would like the child support laws changed . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I'll leave it with you in the hope that you maybe able to do something to address the gross inequalities, burden and distress child support indirectly fosters amongst the many Australians whose only crime is, is that they for one reason or another, could not live with their companions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Faithfully yours.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that letter just about says it all. Whilst I have no hesitation in supporting this bill, I do not think it will stop the tide of complaints that we all have coming into our offices concerning child support. As I said at the beginning of my speech, over 80,000 people have signed petitions airing grievances about child support and family laws. That displays the inadequacies of the legislation, although I do not intend for that to imply blame. I simply do not believe one will ever be able to write legislation that pleases everyone in these disputes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given the dissatisfaction with these laws, minor amendments will not, in my view, stop the tide of complaints. Indeed, it has almost become a tidal wave of complaints and I have no doubt that the day will come when completely new legislation will need to be drafted replacing both the Child Support Act and the Family Law Act. I do not see why that should be later rather than sooner. I think the new laws should be on the agenda of all political parties.</PARA></SPEECH>
<SPEECH PAGE="4791" TIME="8.36 p.m." SPEAKER="Thomson, Kelvin, MP" NAMEID="UK6" ELECTORATE="Wills" PARTY="ALP" GOV="0">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UK6">Mr KELVIN THOMSON</NAME><ELECTORATE> (Wills)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(8.36 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is nice to have an audience of such size for this debate on the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill. This is a very tough area; there are no easy answers here. There is an interaction between family law issues with issues involving access to children, property law and so on. There are people who deny this but these
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4792"> issues are certainly not separate in the minds of those who are affected. I want to take this opportunity to put forward an idea which I have had in mind for some time in relation to property settlements. I would be interested in parliamentary and public reaction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Family law is presently extremely costly, both to public legal aid and private legal parties. Many of the outcomes are not well regarded by the parties who are involved with them and a lot of them have a poisonous effect on interpersonal relationships. I think we need to look at codifying property settlements so that people know exactly where they stand so that there is no need to litigate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am interested in a system analogous to what happens with wills where the government regards as legally enforceable any agreement concerning property division in the event of separation or divorce made either before marriage or during marriage. However, in the absence of any such agreement we would have all property split fifty&hyphen;fifty in the event of a marriage breakdown, without regard to the issue of contribution or who has custody of the children and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also interested in the idea of an opt&hyphen;out provision concerning child support whereby both parents would be given the option of assuming up to 50 per cent of the responsibility for maintenance of their children. If they agree to accept 50 per cent responsibility, the Child Support Agency would not be involved in that particular family circumstance. Of course, if they did not want to do that then the child support arrangements would apply. There has been a lot of debate about legal aid cuts in the context of the Commonwealth budget. It has a massive family law budget&mdash;I think, in excess of $100 million&mdash;and it does seem to me that we ought to be able to do a lot better than we are doing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second thing I want to do is pay tribute to the work done by the member for Chifley, (Mr Price), in this area. Child support is a work in progress and it is remarkable to see the extent of the praise coming to the member for Chifley from both sides of the chamber. So much so that I think it is worth drawing attention to some of the specific references. The member for Sturt (Mr Pyne) pointed out that the member for Chifley headed up the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues, and also pointed out that this committee broke the record for the number of submissions received by a joint select committee or a standing committee on any issue being investigated. He said that the member for Chifley did a very good job with his committee. That has been said by other speakers in this debate, and I am sure it will be said throughout the debate. Indeed, the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think that the Price report did a good job. I believe that we should be looking more closely at that report and doing more in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The member for Bowman (Mrs West) said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My congratulations go to the member for Chifley (Mr Price) on the Price report. He did an excellent job. It is now up to the government to put these recommendations into place.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Then later we find the member for Dawson (Mrs De&hyphen;Anne Kelly) saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would simply like to conclude by saying that many excellent recommendations have been made in the report of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Matters, and I believe that they do need to be addressed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We also had the member for Canning (Mrs Johnston) saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before I start, I would like to commend the work that has been done by the member for Chifley (Mr Price). Not only is he very passionate about what he is doing, but he has also put a lot of work into it in previous years, and I congratulate him for it.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4793"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">None of those members are Labor members. There are Labor members who supported the work of the member for Chifley, such as the member for Isaacs (Mr Wilton). But I think it reflects a remarkable degree of support for his conscientiousness and basic sense of fairness and decency on these issues, and I personally start with a presumption that his views in this area ought to be accorded a great deal of weight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third thing that I wish to do is to support the amendments moved by the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) concerning the bill before the parliament. I think these amendments are worth repeating. The member for Werriwa has moved that the House:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> expresses concern at the failure of the Howard Government, after 12 months in office, to respond to the recommendations of the report of the Joint Select Committee into Certain Family Law Issues, entitled `Child Support Scheme: An Examination of the Operation and Effectiveness of the Scheme';</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> believes the Government should be concerned about the well&hyphen;being and welfare of all families: whether they be intact families, separated families, single parent families or serial families;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> notes with concern the failure to implement some of the report's recommendations has caused parents and their children to suffer needless hardship;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> believes that there is important and urgent need to improve and strengthen the Child Support Scheme; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> considers that much time has been lost and therefore the Government should respond to the recommendations of the report concerned with changing the child support formula as soon as possible and introduce legislation within six months to this effect.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is an issue about which massive community concern has been expressed. That has been noted by previous speakers from all sides.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will just note a couple of the observations of the member for Calare (Mr Andren) who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By far the most angry and disgruntled group of people are the men who have lost custody of their children and have also lost out or come out with a lesser share in the divorce settlement. They are now paying substantial amounts of income in child support. In many cases their former wives have now found new partners and so have an extra income coming in. The way men see it, they have lost their wife, their house and their kids, and are now continuing to lose a large slice of their income.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Similarly, the member for Capricornia (Mr Marek) reported to the parliament on a national conference on family law issues held by the Lone Fathers Association. He noted a set of groups which attended this conference, including DADS, the Child Support Action Group, GRANS, the Family Law Reform Party, Non Custodial Parents, New South Wales Family Law  Reform, Parents Without Partners, and others as well. It is an extraordinary flowering of groups, if you like.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not a nation of joiners. To have so many groups which have arisen to try and address some of the issues in this area does suggest that it is an area of substantial concern. I have had the same sort of feedback in my own electorate. The previous speaker, the member for Stirling (Mr Eoin Cameron) referred to cases and correspondence which he had received. I have received a number of similar letters, including one from a woman whose husband was previously married. She and her husband have one child.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She went through the child support formula and said that, from her point of view, the two children of her husband's first marriage were being regarded as more valuable than children that she has with this man. She regards that as a most unfair situation. When she challenged this, she said, `We were told by the Child Support Agency that disregarded income levels for custodial parents are as high as they are to encourage them to work.' Her observation is that since the child support becomes so large, why in fact would they work?</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4794">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this particular case, the husband had been staying home to look after the child&mdash;and, in this day and age, a lot of people would regard it as very appropriate and quite reasonable for husbands to stay at home and look after their children. As a result, he was not earning any income. His former wife challenged the idea that he was not earning any income under ground 8 of the grounds of application. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The income, earning capacity, property and financial resources of one of the parents or the child are not properly reflected in the assessment.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I have to say that, when I look at that ground, it seems to me to be extraordinarily open&hyphen;ended and to give the child support review officers an extraordinary amount of discretion.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In fact, in this case, the assessment was made that the husband was able to provide child support, notwithstanding that he did not have an income. In the report of this case, the review officer said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I note that the Payer's new wife is therefore able to work full time to support the family.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What is clearly going on here is that the husband's income is not being taken into account but his wife's income is being taken into account. This seems to me to be an unusual state of affairs and one which certainly can give rise to anomalies. We do receive correspondence of this kind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was another letter from a person in New South Wales who, I assume, wrote to all members of parliament. In his case, he said that the amount being deducted by the Child Support Agency was close to five times in excess of the amount that he had agreed on with his ex&hyphen;wife. Initially, she agreed to refund the excess amount that came to her but, after the payments started, she was not interested in doing so. In his letter he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not understand how the government can say that the more money I earn, the more my children cost to raise.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is reflective of the substantial community concern that has arisen in this area.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> These issues are reflected in the statements made by the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) when he put forward the opposition's amendment. In so doing, he expressed concern that the government, after 12 months in office, had failed to respond to the basic findings and recommendations of the parliamentary report of 1994 and that delay was occurring in addressing these issues. He pointed out that this committee had received something like 6,200 submissions, the largest number of submissions ever received by any committee of this parliament. The member for  Werriwa also made some important comments about some of the fundamental concepts at stake here. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As is so often the case with these win&hyphen;lose scenarios, the child support area has been seen through the prism of gender equity issues.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is also much healthier for the parliament and parliamentarians to consider child support through the prism of income equity concerns and to examine the fairness of the existing income transfers implicit in the formula.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We should blindfold ourselves to whether the parent is male or female, and rather take an income equity focus on these questions.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He further said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . by blindfolding ourselves to the gender equity concerns, the parliament can have a far healthier and productive debate.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4795"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is an accurate way to look at these issues and to try to deal with them conceptually. I have a couple of additional remarks that I would like to make before concluding. One is that the member for Dawson (Mrs De&hyphen;Anne Kelly) referred to the idea of linking child support and access issues. I have to say that the law to date, or certainly in recent times, has regarded these as entirely distinct issues and has not been willing to see it that way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do think, having spoken to quite a few parents who have been on the sharp end of the child support and access issues, that there is something in what the member for Dawson is saying, because you do get a situation where, if access orders are being flouted, the non-custodial parent is required to go to court himself or herself to seek court orders. There is always the onus of time, energy and expense resting on them, whereas, if a child support order is flouted, you have the full majesty of the Taxation Office and the Child Support Agency coming down on the person in breach of the child support order. It does seem to me that consideration ought to be given to some linkage or to at least developing a situation where those issues are dealt with in a more comparable way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I think that family law and child support issues are a work in progress. My ideas on this issue are developing, as I believe that all of our ideas need to develop, in the light of experience. But the case for some action now is indeed overwhelming and government legislation, which picks up only some of the Price committee recommendations, simply does not go far enough. I do not think it is good enough for coalition members, pre-election, to be picking up votes by bagging the Child Support Agency and child support arrangements. It is now up to coalition members to actually do something about it. Supporting or taking on board the amendments proposed by the member for Werriwa would be a very good place to start.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to represent the numerous paying parents in the seat of Lindsay who have come to see me over the last 14 months regarding the efficacy of the child support legislation. It is interesting to note, in any discussion on this subject, the actual history of child support and the Family Law Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the Family Law Act was first introduced in 1975, it was only a small act of about one centimetre in thickness. It was designed to simplify the whole family law relationship and to move away from the concept of fault in any relationship breakdown. That act is now a three-volume practice manual of about 10 inches in thickness. The Child Support Agency Act was introduced in 1988.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By now, we are well away from the concept of fault. We are well down the track where there is an accepted community morality about the obligations to pay child support. Yet there are parties leaving a marital break&hyphen;up who feel like criminals. The intrusion into their personal affairs has been to such an extent that they have felt hounded. They have often given up jobs, given up employment prospects and moved into a cash society to avoid moral obligations or social obligations. This act goes some way to mending their feelings in terms of being able to hide from employers the fact that they have had a marital bust-up or that they are in fact experiencing some personal problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that is an important olive branch to offer in the family law disputes that do take place in today's society. It is something that this society is going to have to deal with and deal with in a very humane fashion, because more and more marriages are breaking up and more and more families are now second or third families. It is those people in those relationships that need to be considered. Gone are the days where people will break up after a 20&hyphen; or 30-year marriage when no more children will be forthcoming.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4796">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These days, you will find that, quite frequently, there are three or four children&mdash;all under the age of 15&mdash;from different parents, and all liable to be attracting child support. When you have 27 per cent of your gross wage going towards paying for two children from a previous marriage, you are probably paying 47 per cent in tax, and you are left with 26 per cent of your wage for your second family, which may have up to three children and a dependent spouse, you start to get very concerned about the efficaciousness of this legislation. It has resulted in an inordinate number of complaints.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By reducing the intrusiveness on people's subsequent lives when they move on from a marital break&hyphen;up, when they move into further relationships, when they move into further employment prospects, they feel that it gives them a chance to mend old wounds. It gives them a chance to move on and develop a better working relationship with their previous spouse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is crucial for the forward progress of this society. We need to achieve the original objectives of the Family Law Act 1975. We need to get to the stage where these matters are resolved by the couple on a basis that each feels has dealt with their needs. They need to feel that they have been fairly dealt with. They need to have a basis for continuing with their current and future living arrangements, and for continually changing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The adversarial system&mdash;the number of complaints and the number of political organisations that have formed such as the Lone Parents Association, DADS and the Family Law Reform Party&mdash;is an indication that there is growing distress from marital break&hyphen;up. The purpose of this legislation at all times&mdash;and into the future&mdash;is to move these matters out of the legal system and into a social and community context, into alternative dispute resolution and into support for future families from both parents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not a male or female issue. Quite frequently these days, the female is the paying parent and, quite frequently, it is the female of a second or third marriage who is wearing the consequences of prior relationships. These things, in light of a changing society and very mobile family relationships, are going to continue to be part of society. Our definition of family continually needs to evolve and we continually need to update legislation to make it reflect the times.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most paying parents have a very sincere attitude to their children. They want to have a continuing relationship with the children and they spend an enormous amount of money on  their children when they have access. Child support needs to take into account a number of payments that paying parents are already making.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This act goes some way to delivering, for the paying parent, a feeling that their concerns are being listened to by government, that there is some hope in the future before their children turn 18 when they can mend the fences with their previous spouse and get to some cordial social relationship where they can, between themselves, make payments to each other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also gives the parents a chance to choose how they are going to pay for their child support. By voluntarily paying it to the parent with custodial obligations, it takes the fault away from the paying spouse. They then feel that their personal affairs are not aired in public with their employers by having their wages garnisheed or by having to do battle in that adversarial manner with the Child Support Agency. They feel more adult about getting on with their responsibilities to their children and their previous relationships, whilst still leaving room for them to get on with new relationships and family matters.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4797">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is a very important step. It certainly does not go far enough, and the committee is working to move in the direction of answering all concerns in this area, both for the custodial spouse and for the paying parent. With that, I commend the bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Deputy Speaker, with your indulgence, I will spend the first couple of minutes relating a story that came to me today. It is not particularly related to the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1), but it is certainly related to the issue of what this bill addresses. To those present tonight who are mums and dads&mdash;and I stress that what I am going to say to you, as the member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly) said, is not a male or female issue; it can happen to either parent&mdash;you might understand what I am going to say to you.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> One of my staff, in fact, has separated from his spouse and there has been a terrible problem in that separation. My staff member lives on Magnetic Island so has to catch a ferry from the mainland to the island. The other spouse, in fact, spends quite a lot of time on Magnetic Island and catches a similar ferry. There is a child of that relationship and just on the weekend that particular spouse and child were on the ferry when the person who works for me also got on that ferry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the person got on the ferry the young child who is a young man of about four years of age saw his father and said, `Daddy. Daddy,' and basically called to him to come. So the father in that situation went to his son, took him in his arms and hugged him, and spent some time with his son. When the ferry got to the other end of the journey to Magnetic Island, the other spouse went straight to the police and reported the father for stalking and for attempting to abduct his son.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What a sad situation this would be. How you would abduct your son on a ferry I do not know. Those of us who have a loving relationship and who have sons and daughters can understand how a dad would feel in that situation. I do not know why this is happening. In my own marriage I have a wonderful relationship. I have a wonderful son and daughter. But how can we in our society today have a situation where dads or mums cannot see their sons or daughters when they should see them. What is wrong with us? What is wrong with our society? At the moment I feel the way the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Beazley) did. I did not intend this, but it is just how I feel. Why do parents have to separate? Why do they have to use each other in this way. No&hyphen;one cares about the kids. Thank God, Margaret, Mark and I and my daughter, Kylie, are a loving family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should get back to the text of my speech now. When I became a member of parliament I was astonished by the level of public concern regarding family law and child support issues. Often the two are confused which does not help matters. It did not take me long to get an indication of the depth of the problems that I was being confronted with from day one in my term as a member of the federal parliament. Even now, some 14 months down the track, it is still difficult to know where to begin addressing the problems my constituents bring to me. I see on a daily basis examples of how the current CSA system is not working. My Townsville office staff have lost count of the number of times that they have taken calls from women and men who have gone through the Family Court and the child support system and have come out the other end almost literally with nothing to live for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is heartbreaking to listen to grown men and women fall to pieces over the phone because they have not seen their children for months on end even though they are legally entitled to see them, or because they have not received any child support payments. I can understand why
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4798"> people talk openly about living only from one day to the next and seriously contemplating on a daily basis taking their lives. As much as I admire the people who work in the Townsville Child Support Agency, they can only operate under the system we helped set up for them and we know that, while the system has vastly improved over recent years, it is still not working.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will support the changes presented in this bill, but I think everyone who has spoken on this bill recognises the need to go much further in terms of legislative changes. Half&hyphen;hearted attempts to change the system will not really achieve the change for the better we all know the system desperately needs. We all know family breakdown can turn into a very bitter and nasty affair. One party blames the other; they both get lawyers; both parties seem willing to do or say anything to get custody of children, and so it goes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We might have to be mindful that, when we do try to change the way in which the CSA operates, we may change it for the benefit of one party, but to the detriment of the other, be they custodial or non&hyphen;custodial. We also need to be mindful of the fact that, in dealing with cases of family breakdown, you simply are not going to be able to please 100 per cent of the people 100 per cent of the time. We need to weigh up the pros and cons of legislative change and act to make the CSA as workable and as fair as possible. My fear is that, if we set out to please everybody, we will end up with half&hyphen;hearted reforms that will not go to the root of the problems members and senators see walking through their doors&mdash;week in, week out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By far and away, the largest number of Townsville CSA related complaints I receive come from the non&hyphen;custodial parents. I receive, as I am sure every other member of this House does, many complaints from custodial parents about the Child Support Agency. More often than not those complaints are from women who are faced with having to make repayments because the child support paying father's income has changed. This often places custodial parents in a very difficult financial position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, in between his income changing and the administrative process recognising the change in income status occurring, the paying parent is still paying at a higher rate than he can afford. The receiving parent is at the same time being overpaid and running up a bill she will have to repay once the system catches up with the change in the paying parent's income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This impacts on both parents, the custodial and the non&hyphen;custodial. I have seen, on more than one occasion, mothers come into my Townsville office in tears because they have just received a letter telling them that they have to pay back a considerable sum of money because of overpayments. In cases I have personally come across, quite often the single mother is not in  a position where she can repay this money, certainly not in one lump sum and certainly not in the time indicated on the letter that she receives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed amendment will reduce the incidence of overpayments to persons receiving child support which currently arise because of the retrospective effect of an income estimate election. It will better reflect a payer's future capacity to pay because the amount payable will only be changed for the months remaining after the estimate has been lodged. It will reduce the level of child support arrears that may arise when payers spend amounts refunded to them as overpayments, but later do not have the funds to meet their advised ongoing child support liability. I certainly hope that this will be the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The explanatory memorandum further states, in relation to the use of election where income changed, the parents paying child support will still pay the correct amount for the year based on the income estimate. If overpayments are made, they will reduce the remaining child support liability for the remaining part of the year. Similarly, underpayments will be offset
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4799"> evenly throughout the remainder of the year and this is a very good position to be in. These are good measures, which will take some pressure off the child support receiving parents, who instead of being faced with repaying overpayments, will instead have their repayments reduced for a period of time to reflect the relative size of the overpayment.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that such a change will be easier for child support recipients to manage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have in the parliament today a petition of 1,300 signatures calling on reforms for the Child Support Agency and family law system. This petition was compiled by Mr Laurie Chalker in my electorate. Mr Chalker was due to start a marathon run from Townsville to Canberra last month in protest at the way in which the CSA and the family law systems do not work. Unfortunately, his run had to be cancelled. Had he been able to travel all the way to Canberra collecting signatures, this group of signatures would have been but a small fraction of what Laurie would have been able to collect. That brings me to another point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All the people with CSA problems who walk through our individual electorate doors are but pieces of a very large jigsaw. The fact that so many members have spoken on this bill, and intend to speak on this bill, is evidence that Child Support Agency problems are not confined to just Queensland, Tasmania or Victoria. As elected representatives speaking on this bill we are individual pieces in a much larger jigsaw. I am the Herbert piece; Bruce Billson is the Dunkley piece; Mr McClelland is the Barton piece, and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Individually, we may just be one voice representing one small part of Australia. But, if you take us collectively, all the small pieces add up to form a very large picture. That picture is of the mums and dads, and most importantly of all the children, caught up in family breakdown as they are crying out for change and reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was only last week I was visited by a constituent, in this case a custodial parent, and it was a lady. She said, `Mr Lindsay, I've just received a bill for $2,000 that I must pay because the Child Support Agency has overpaid me. I've spent that money in the last six months, I've spent it on my children. I run a very tight financial position but I now have this bill that I must pay. How do I pay it?' That is what we are dealing with tonight. These are the sorts of things that the government and the opposition, in a bipartisan way, need to be mindful of and need to do something about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have certainly been very active in working on the government members' Child Support Agency subcommittee because I believe that we have a responsibility as members of this parliament to try to correct the wrongs that exist currently in the system. I can understand the  impatience to have these wrongs corrected. Since the recommencement of the parliamentary sittings I have been telling my constituents that we must make changes to the legislation, and what we are dealing with tonight is part of that. It is now June; we are still going. The worst part about it is that no&hyphen;one is really disagreeing with what we are trying to do, whether it be on the opposition side or on the government side.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope that together we can do something that will be for the benefit of those families who have been split in unfortunate circumstances. While tonight's legislative changes are relatively small, I find it a bit disconcerting that we simply cannot push it through because while we talk and adjourn, and talk and adjourn, people's lives are being adversely affected. I certainly hope that we can get support tonight for this bill. I invite all of my colleagues to support it, as I do.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KV5">Mr NEVILLE</NAME><ELECTORATE> (Hinkler)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(9.13 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak this evening on the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996. I think we all know the philosophy behind the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4800"> Child Support Agency. That philosophy is that if you bring a child into the world then you take responsibility for that child, whether your relationship with your partner continues or not. Too often in the past husbands, and de facto husbands, deserted their wives and left their children to the tender mercies of the state. It is not fair that the taxpayers of Australia should pay for the irresponsibility of those fathers, or for that matter those mothers, who for one reason or another desert their children, yet may well have the means to support them, totally or in part.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the Child Support Agency was brought in to correct this anomaly. It depended on an order from the court or a percentage payment levied on the non&hyphen;custodial parent to support his or her children. It was collected by an agency within the taxation department. All those things are quite appropriate mechanisms but I do not think the original system took sufficient note of the human dimension of this problem. Such a system depends on goodwill and where that is absent there can be a lack of equality or empowerment. What I mean by that is that both parties initially, at the time when arrangements are made or need to be modified, should be able to represent their case in an equal and unfettered way. But quite often we see the situation where one party has legal aid and the other party has not. That of itself I think leads to quite an imbalance in the outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose that&mdash;as most do when they come into this job as a member of parliament&mdash;I felt that the responsibility to the CSA and the matter of custody and access were separate and distinct issues. After four years in the job I do not believe that any longer. In fact, I believe the diametrical opposite. Regardless of what previous parliaments have said, regardless of what my own party or the Labor Party have said, I have come inexorably to the conclusion that those two things are linked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that the custodial parent&mdash;the one in receipt of child support&mdash;has both a financial and custodial advantage. If this is not exercised with equanimity and natural justice a gross distortion and disadvantage occurs to the non&hyphen;custodial parent. For example, where a custodial parent says, `Yes, under the terms of the arrangement made by the court you can have the children for the school holidays but you will have to pay the airfares,' which might be quite considerable, what that often does is deprive the non&hyphen;custodial parent of the short number of weeks&mdash;two, four or six weeks a year&mdash;that that parent might have the children; it deprives the parent of the ability to give them a decent and meaningful holiday; and it deprives them of the opportunity to create a relationship with the children, albeit over a very short period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps if the custodial parent is totally manipulative they might put it on the non&hyphen;custodial parent, even over that short period, to provide the children with new clothes, school clothes for the coming year or warm clothes if there is a climatic change. In other words, the kids become a sort of bargaining chip. They become collateral in the relationship. I am deeply saddened when I see non&hyphen;custodial parents, generally the fathers&mdash;and I do not say that with any sexist overtones whatsoever; it is generally the fathers&mdash;deprived of a meaningful relationship with their children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe this could be addressed very easily, as indeed the recognition of the interrelationship between custody and access on one hand and maintenance on the other would confirm. I feel that on those occasions where the non&hyphen;custodial parent is in control of the children, whether the maintenance payments be voluntary or court established, the maintenance payment should be suspended for the non&hyphen;custodial parent. In other words, if the non&hyphen;custodial parent
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4801"> is taking care of the children during that period, then the equivalent of the fees should go to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It could be argued that the custodial parent has responsibilities over and above that in the home&mdash;electricity, rates, rent and so on&mdash;that continue whether the children are there or not and that perhaps there could be some formularisation of this on a one&hyphen;third/two&hyphen;thirds basis. In principle, I think that should be the case. During times of voluntarily agreed or court established access, the non&hyphen;custodial parent should not have to pay any form of maintenance, or perhaps only a limited amount to cover the ongoing running costs of the home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This would be a discipline on manipulative custodial parents. A person might be using the kids as a weapon against the non&hyphen;custodial parent. She might be making it as hard as possible for him to have the kids, saying things like, `I'm going to make sure that he pays the fares and buys the kids warm clothes&mdash;I'm going to make it as difficult as possible for him.' Or she might say, `I'm going to say that the kids have got the flu and they can't come for four weeks; they can only come for two.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that situation, whatever the court or the voluntary agreement determined in terms of access would be invoked. For the period that was laid down in that agreement or that court access, the payments by the non&hyphen;custodial parent to the custodial parent would be suspended. I think that would solve a lot of problems very simply and very effectively.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we are sincere about this, if we are fair dinkum that the welfare of the children should be the dominant feature of these relationships, then they cannot be used as collateral; they cannot be used as bargaining chips. I have heard of some horrific cases where fathers have waited for years to see their kids and, because of personal animosity between the mother and the father, the mother decides that she is going to put every possible barrier in the way of the father.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That sometimes spills over into even more vindictive activities. It is sad, too, that some sections of the legal fraternity are not lilywhite in this matter. There is a system in vogue at present, if the lawyers I speak to are any measure of the activity, that says that when a person is in a disadvantageous situation in a custody hearing, regardless of whether her ex&hyphen;spouse is violent or not, regardless of whether he has been showing animus towards the wife or not, a restraining order is taken out against him&mdash;not because he has done anything wrong, but because that will place the custodial parent in an advantageous position in the court hearing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is even worse&mdash;and this appals me right to my very core&mdash;is that quite often the charge is made that the father has sexually molested the children. Over the last four years, an  increasing number of non&hyphen;custodial parents&mdash;in nearly all cases fathers&mdash;have come to me as white as a sheet saying, `I have never had any criminal conviction of any sort against me in my life. Now I am accused of molesting my children. I can no longer see them, except under supervision'&mdash;or in some cases not at all&mdash;`because of the charge made by my former spouse.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a shocking and deliberate evil that is perpetrated that destroys the relationship between the non&hyphen;custodial parent and the children. The children, of course, know it is false, but society does not, and it places all the people in the chain&mdash;the Family Court, the bailiffs, the police and all those that get involved in these activities&mdash;in a horrendous position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have seen this in the case of a constituent in my electorate&mdash;and I repeat this in many of these speeches because I cannot get it out of my mind. When the actual court cases for custody and separation were going on, his wife received legal aid, whereas he hitchhiked on semitrailers some 1,000 kilometres or more from my electorate to Sydney. He went into court
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4802"> unrepresented. His former wife went into court with, on one occasion, a solicitor and two barristers. Despite this, he made a very good fist of it. The wife perjured herself on numerous occasions and got custody of the children, claiming to take them to a new relationship with her parents in western New South Wales. Within a month she was in a de facto relationship in North Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I saw that father with his limited resources do everything he could to regain those children. He had lost his home, a very successful business, and access to his children. But his wife used her position quite unconscionably and finally he was able to bring her to court in North Queensland for defiance of the custody arrangements in contempt of the Family Court. In the course of that particular case she argued&mdash;by the way, without any disclosure of this prior to the case&mdash;that some 11 years earlier he had molested her sister. On the basis of that charge, on what was probably the penultimate case in that custody hearing, that father from that day to this did not see his kids except under supervision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just find it appalling. But what is even worse is that, on the basis of this charge, the New South Wales police have charged him with interfering with that girl 11 years earlier. It is not for me to go into that case because it is before the courts but I just want to show you one of the extreme cases of the disintegration of a family. At the end of the day, what was the separation all about? Was it not for a better life for each of them and for the kids? What have they all ended up with: total and utter misery and the kids not knowing whether they are coming or going.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think in the time that is available to me I would like to say something about second families. Many speakers have spoken of them. The Child Support Agency recognises that when there is a break&hyphen;up the children of the custodial parent often enter a new relationship. Sometimes it is one of great opulence and wealth and quite often the non&hyphen;custodial parent, already deprived of his children, finds a new relationship. Sometimes that relationship involves the children of his new partner&mdash;his stepchildren. But they are receiving no child support from their father or their non&hyphen;custodial parent because, perhaps, he was a waster, or a pensioner. Perhaps he was not in a position to pay any maintenance payments and for that reason the children of that second family, and the whole family, live at a gross disadvantage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that what we have to do is not have these ironclad rules but, rather, look at the whole family situation. Does anyone seriously pretend that when the custodial parent goes into an opulent relationship and gets maintenance payments from the previous, non&hyphen;custodial parent, the payments are going to be divvied up between the children and the stepchildren strictly in  accordance with the way the father pays maintenance? Of course not. All the kids are going to be treated equally&mdash;and so they should be. But when you come back to the other family, the second family of the non&hyphen;custodial parent, quite often there is no wealth, and there is no adjusting mechanism made available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also believe that we need a more effective way of being able to alter arrangements. I had a case where a wife went off the rails mentally, claimed that she had separated from her husband, received maintenance payments for some years, and had them sent to a false address. It was a very clever scam, actually. It was not until her husband noticed how his tax refund cheques were falling and queried, on the third year, how he could lose the $4,000 refund he was expecting that he discovered it. They said, `You are separated from your wife.' He said, `No I am not.' He subsequently did separate from her. But during that period it was established by statutory declarations, by declarations from neighbours, that during the period for which
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4803"> this huge Child Support Agency bill had accumulated they had indeed not been separated. In fact, he had not been out of the family home for more than three nights in the whole period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I put that whole case to the Child Support Agency&mdash;and admittedly it was before the previous inquiry that we had in the last parliament, so I imagine things have improved, but it illustrates the point&mdash;there was no automatic adjustment. He was told, `There is nothing we can do about that. You will have to take it back to the court.' Where there is clear evidence like that, why put the whole system to that financial burden? In an instance like that, I think there should be something in provincial cities. Perhaps if we had Child Support Agency magistrates who would sit in the magistrate's court in the main provincial cities, they could hear these matters quickly and issue an order varying the regulations or the arrangements, rather than taking the whole business back through the Family Court. Surely something like that would be preferable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have only touched on a few points tonight, but I think they are very important points. As I said before, if we are fair dinkum about the welfare of the children, if we are fair dinkum about people who have separated in a supposedly non&hyphen;fault environment being able to rebuild their lives, then what we have to do is get this system right.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like most members in this House, I have found that the statistics in my electorate office show that by far the largest number of inquiries, and the most emotional and most time consuming, relate to the Child Support Agency. Nobody in my office, including me, was in any way qualified to be able to deal with some of the problems and concerns that have come into the office. I must say that I have quickly learnt to be able to give some words of wisdom to some of the unfortunate victims of this particular government bureaucracy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those words of wisdom are: no matter what you think of your partner, no matter how much you dislike your partner, go out and talk to your partner, find some sort of common ground and strike a deal, because the moment you walk away and look for a third party, that being the Child Support Agency, you are guaranteed to lose. Unfortunately, that is the reality of it; unfortunately also, with human nature, with the anger and bitterness associated with separation and a tug of war to try to inflict some sort of emotional gain through the children, it is not at all possible in most cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Although, like any thinking Australian, I agree with the concept behind the child support scheme that parenthood has its price and responsibilities regardless of the state of a marriage and that taxpayers should not bear the burden of failed marriages, after the relatively short  time that I have spent as a member, it seems obvious to me that the administration of the child support scheme has gone dramatically off the rails. Legislation before the House in this bill is aimed at correcting some minor flaws encountered in the scheme and I commend those changes to the House. But this legislation needs to go much further than these changes. It is my belief that the whole operation of the child support scheme needs to be revisited in the name of fairness to all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question needs to be asked: what is the agenda driving this scheme and the agency that enforces it? Yet it has become readily apparent to me&mdash;and dare I say to the majority of members of this House&mdash;that the whole soul and structure of the child support scheme is in need of a dispassionate and all&hyphen;encompassing review, with a new, fresh, fair and rational approach to be taken.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4804">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Problems with the child support service were of such an intense and urgent nature that late last year I had to convene a child support forum in Cairns, the main population centre in my electorate, which attracted over 70 participants. One of the problems facing the victims of the current child support scheme that came out of this forum and from the electorate office inquiries is that it would appear that the whole core of the problem can probably be best addressed by the vision statement of the Lone Fathers Association of Australia. That is that all parties in the divorce situation, including the non&hyphen;custodial parent, enjoy a fair and equitable distribution of financial resources emanating from a child support scheme and fair and equitable access to the children involved. Disregarding for the moment the attitudinal problems emanating from the CSA staff in their dealings with non&hyphen;custodial parents, the two primary problems seem to be in the assessment levels of child&hyphen;care contributions and the tax treatment of the CSS payments by contributing parents&mdash;the accountability of the money paid to the custodial parents through the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me make one point very clear. In most of the dealings my office has had with non&hyphen;custodial parents in the child support cases, there is absolutely no argument that a rational and reasonable level of contribution must be made towards the upkeep of children of failed marriages. Most non&hyphen;custodial parents accept this fact and willingly accept the concept of maintenance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem is the methodology upon which the CSS is based and its enactment by the Child Support Agency. Firstly, on the assessment level, currently the formula used by the CSA is 18 per cent of gross wages for the first child, rising to 26 per cent of gross for five or more children. A major problem is in the use of the gross wage for the assessment purposes. The net effect of this payment to the average non&hyphen;custodial parent can be as high as a third to half more in real dollar terms than those percentages reflect on paper.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government can take a major initiative in fairness by adjusting the formula to either a percentage of the net wage or by allowing the CSS payments to be tax deductible. The real effect of this arbitrary and unfair method of assessment is that many non&hyphen;custodial parents are leaving the work force and going onto the dole, simply because they feel that they are better off on the dole than having to pay exorbitant levels of support demanded of them under the current system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you have any doubts about this, you merely have to look at the number of non&hyphen;custodial parents in receipt of unemployment benefits. Approximately 30 per cent currently have taken that option and that is more than three times the national unemployment average. So, by default, government action to recover child support payments and reduce the burden on the taxpayer have the opposite effect of encouraging people onto the dole, thereby costing the taxpayer seven or eight times more than it would cost just to pay child support in addition to the sole parent pension. Talk about a hollow victory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem with the assessment formula does not stop there. The anomaly between the level at which the Department of Social Security assesses the worth of the child and the level at which the CSA can assess the same child for higher income earners borders on the ridiculous. Standard DSS family payment for one child is $93.10 per fortnight. Yet a non&hyphen;custodial parent on a basic wage is forced to pay $186.70 per fortnight, slightly more than double what the government considers to be the worth of a child.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the non&hyphen;custodial parent's income gets higher, the contribution level per child becomes commensurately more out of step with reality. There is no differentiation as to the age of the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4805"> child or children. For example, a three&hyphen;year&hyphen;old qualifies the custodial parent for the same rate of payment as does a 13-year&hyphen;old, yet anyone would know that the cost of upkeep and education of a teenager is much higher than that of a toddler.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that the real problem is the escalating divorce rate in Australia. As a government, we are committed to a return to family values and it devolves upon us to look at some of the major issues that are contributing to the current high level of family break&hyphen;up in this nation. However, in the interim we have to look closely at how we can address the myriad of anomalies in the current child support scheme. Let us never lose sight of the real purpose of this scheme and our primary focus must always be on the innocent victims, the children. I must also acknowledge that in the majority of cases, both parents&mdash;and I repeat, both&mdash;have a deep love and intense interest in their children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Accountability of CSA payments in the hands of the custodial parents also seems to be one of the major problems associated with the scheme. This is a major source of conflict that I and my staff are hearing from non&hyphen;custodial parents. The impression that they receive is that there is no accountability as to the direction of expenditure of CSA payments in the custodial parent's hands and that in many cases the money is used on expenditure totally unassociated with the care and upbringing of their child or children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another concern is that when the custodial parent has taken up with another partner in a de facto relationship and both parties work, it is not uncommon to find a non&hyphen;custodial parent reduced to poverty through a CSA ruling on maintenance while a custodial parent enjoys their own income, sometimes an income on a par with their ex&hyphen;spouse, as well as the income of their de facto. I have heard of cases where a custodial parent in a new family situation and earning well in excess of $100,000 a year is receiving substantial CSA payments from an ex&hyphen;spouse who is struggling to meet these payments, as well as having to cater for a new family on a single income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Possibly we, as a government, should look at setting up within the CSA a trust situation where the custodial parent is allowed to draw down regular maintenance payments from the moneys contributed by non&hyphen;custodial parents for living costs and must account for all other major items of expenditure on the child or children for things such as education and other expenses.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This would ensure that funds contributed by non-custodial parents are used exclusively for what they were intended, the maintenance and upbringing of the child.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another major area of concern that has been brought to my attention from dealing with people involved in the child support scheme is the problem of child access. There seems to be no relationship between demands to pay CSA payments and the paying parent's right to  access the child. The dogma of confidentiality is so entrenched in the bureaucrats at the Child Support Agency that non&hyphen;custodial parents are often hounded for payments of child support, even when the custodial parent is ignoring decisions from the Family Court as regards access to children. It should be a two&hyphen;way street. If the CSA is going to religiously enforce one law, the payment of child maintenance, then it should ensure that the other laws of a family nature are adhered to and that custodial parents abide by Family Court access decisions. I believe that this is only fair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us turn to the Child Support Agency itself. There are major attitudinal problems within the CSA that need addressing urgently. There would appear to be a regime of arrogance in place that in talks with my colleagues I have found to be almost universal across Australia.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4806"> Non&hyphen;custodial parents are treated in the main with contempt by the apparatchiks who staff this agency, which is totally contrary to the concept of a no fault divorce.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there is to be more than easy access to the termination of marriage that seems to be the norm today, on the basis of no need to prove fault, then there should be no fault attributed to dealings with either the divorced or separated couple. This does not appear to be the case with the CSA. Almost every case that is brought to my office's attention includes an element of dissatisfaction with the attitudes of people in the CSA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Besides problems of arrogance and assumed guilt, there seems to be no continuity of dealing with staff. Non&hyphen;custodial parents rarely speak to the same case officer twice and arbitrary decisions without any semblance of concern for the wellbeing of the non&hyphen;custodial parent, or in many cases for their new family, bring about hardships beyond the normal human compassion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This goes both ways. It is not only the non&hyphen;custodial parent that suffers from the shortcomings of the CSA. There seems to be a regime within the CSA of taking the easy way out. I have a particular case in my electorate where a non&hyphen;custodial father, very well&hyphen;known around the town as being, if not a millionaire, verging on that asset level, has structured his affairs in such a way that he has managed to bring his child support payments down to a mere $30 a week, some $17 a week less than his estranged wife could get in family benefits, forcing his estranged wife to try and raise their daughter on something like $100 a week after mortgage payments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet this gentleman has three booming businesses in Far North Queensland, a large and profitable painting business offshore, and a new one starting in Cairns. He lives in a $650,000 home in an exclusive beach suburb to which he recently added a $50,000 swimming pool and he recently bought his current girlfriend a $100,000 luxury motor car. You can see quite clearly that it goes both ways. I think this is another area that we have to look at very seriously, where people are able to conceal their income and, in doing so, are able to walk away from their commitment of contributing to payments for the upbringing of their children. It seems that, in that case, the CSA found it too hard to research this man's assets and income to realise that he has a very smart accountant and is conning the agency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is in a unique position to put a new broom through much of the anti&hyphen;family legislation that we have inherited. I believe the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) when he says that he wants to run a government that returns this nation to traditional family values that once made it a much more stable society than it is today after 13 years of social engineering. This bill is a small start to cleaning up some of the surface anomalies in the child support legi slation, but we certainly need to go much, much deeper. We need to go right to the heart of this act and bring to it fairness, accountability and justice for all concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am an active member of the recently established government backbench committee dealing with child support legislation, and I am certainly looking forward to changes that we hope will be introduced later this year. There are literally hundreds and thousands of Australians out there, both custodial and non&hyphen;custodial parents, who are haemorrhaging under the socially libertine attacks on the institution of marriage this act encourages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They say that from acorns great oaks grow. I commend this bill to the House, primarily in the hope that it is a first small step in returning justice and fair treatment to what is one of the major social engineering failures of this and the previous decade.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It gives me much pleasure to speak in support of the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996. Since being elected to represent the people of Makin in this place, I have received many requests for assistance in matters relating to child support and the Child Support Agency. It was a matter I raised in my first speech in the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of many constituent inquiries I have received on this issue, I have made numerous representations to the then Assistant Treasurer, Senator Jim Short and the current Assistant Treasurer, Senator Rod Kemp. They have, on each and every occasion, been willing to listen to my requests and have been extremely helpful in seeking a resolution to the particular problem I have been seeking to resolve on behalf of my constituents and, most importantly, their children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of representations from government members, me included, the Assistant Treasurer and the Minister for Social Security, Senator Newman, have established a committee to investigate suggested changes to the child support system. As a member of this committee, I appreciate the opportunity to bring the concerns of my constituents directly to the ministers responsible for the operation of the agency and related services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I place on record my appreciation of the fine work being done by the staff of the Child Support Agency in Adelaide, South Australia. Their work can sometimes be very difficult and distressing, but I have always found them ready and willing to help to the best of their ability, even though the outcomes are not always what both parents would wish.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The establishment of the Child Support Agency has had a significant effect on the number of non&hyphen;custodial parents who now pay child support. Prior to its introduction, it is estimated that only one in three non&hyphen;custodial parents was paying child support. This compares with the current situation where 56 per cent of all collect cases pay child support each and every month. Furthermore, surveys that have been taken suggest that about 85 per cent of registered private collection cases pay regularly. This means that around 65 per cent of registered payers now make regular payments to support their children. These figures illustrate the general success of the agency in ensuring that both parents contribute towards the upbringing of their child or children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite this, however, we recognise that there are problems and inequities within the current system. Over the last three years, the number of cases being dealt with by the Child Support Agency has increased by around 50,000 per year, and this is expected to continue. At the end of last year, there were 247,000 collect cases in the system and a further 164,000 registered private collection cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Howard government's 1996&hyphen;97 budget recognised the necessity of reforming aspects of the system and provided additional resources to the Child Support Agency. As a result of the reforms already made by the government, child support collections increased by $36 million in the 12 months between December 1995 and December 1996, and the amount of child support debt was reduced. Some 80 per cent of total child support liability was collected and distributed to custodial parents, and the number of payers having their arrears directly deducted from their wages increased by more than 4,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is still a need for further improvement, as my constituents will testify, but I am sure that all Australians would be pleased with the progress so far. The issue of the repayment of overpayments by custodial parents has been raised with me on several occasions. On one
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4808"> occasion, a distressed constituent contacted me after receiving a letter from the Child Support Agency requesting her to repay a sum of money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The constituent had already used the money to provide her two children with the opportunity to visit their grandparents in Victoria. She could not afford to travel with them and had had to scrimp and save to provide them with enough money for the trip. The letter from the agency was a very unpleasant shock to her and she did not know what to do. Thankfully, assistance was provided and her two children got to see their grandparents, but this highlights one of the problems which currently exists and, I am pleased to say, it is being addressed in this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As members would be aware, child support assessments are calculated using the income tax returns of the payer for the previous two years. If the payer feels that his or her income for the current year will be more than 15 per cent less than previously estimated, he or she can have their child support payments reassessed. This estimate affects the child support payments from the beginning of the financial year, meaning that the custodial parent may have to refund money which has already been paid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To illustrate this point, I wish to mention another case which was brought to my attention by one of my constituents. On this occasion, the custodial parent had been overpaid and was required to repay the money. However, the estimate given by the payer had been incorrect and he had, in fact, earned more than his estimate. The result was that my constituent had to pay back all of the amount she was overpaid and then would receive back part of this after the adjustment was made for the payer's incorrect estimate. She could not see the logic in this and, frankly, nor could I.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill changes the way in which overpayments are recovered. A parent will no longer be required to refund money already paid. Overpayments will be recovered by reducing the non&hyphen;custodial parent's payments for the year. Underpayments will also be made up over the period of the year, rather than all at once.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will still be a requirement for the correct and total amount of money for the year to be paid, but these changes will mean that far fewer custodial parents will be required to repay overpaid amounts of child support. This measure will also lead to a more accurate assessment of the non&hyphen;custodial parent's future capacity to pay, because the amount payable will only be changed for the months remaining after the estimate has been lodged. The level of child support arrears should also be reduced as a result of these changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another improvement that will be implemented on the passage of this bill relates to the preferred method of payment by payers of their child support obligations. Currently, many payments are deducted directly from the non&hyphen;custodial parent's wages by his or her employer and sent to the Child Support Agency. I know of a number of my constituents who are distressed by this lack of control over their own finances and who resent the fact that their employers are forced to become involved in a private matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The changes in this bill will allow non&hyphen;custodial parents to make payments directly to the Child Support Agency without the involvement of his or her employer. This is in line with the recommendations of the 1994 Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues&mdash;as is much of this bill. We must give credit to the work done by that committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Naturally, this change to allow non&hyphen;custodial parents to directly pay the agency is subject to the approval of the registrar. The registrar must be satisfied that the parent will pay on time. Custodial parents can be reassured by the fact that the registrar will be able to reverse the decision to allow direct payment if payments are not made on time.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4809">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A payer parent who has had his or her application for direct payment rejected must wait two months before applying again for this method of payment. Similarly, a payer parent who has failed to make regular payments on time, using the direct payment method, may have the employer deductions reintroduced and must wait six months before applying again for the direct payment method.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These provisions safeguard the custodial parent, whilst giving the opportunity to non&hyphen;custodial parents to make regular direct payments to the Child Support Agency. Furthermore, this measure is in line with the government's stated aim of supporting small business. By providing the option of direct payments by the payer parents, the responsibility and associated compliance costs to employers will be reduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A further aspect of this bill that will please non&hyphen;custodial parents, in particular, is the provision to amend the Family Law Act 1975 to enable the court to consider future child support liabilities in property and spousal maintenance proceedings. This will apply even without an administrative assessment under the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have received many representations from non&hyphen;custodial parents who feel that their child support arrangements are unfair and do not take into full account their financial position. The anger and emotion of some of these parents illustrates the need to ensure fairness and equity in dealing with issues relating to child support and family law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been cases where there has been no child support assessment applied for when the custodial parent has applied for child support arrears after the property settlement has been determined. In such cases, the child support liability has not been taken into consideration, to the detriment of the payer parent. Amendments in this bill will allow payer parents to have these future child support obligations recognised and taken into account by the Family Court before the settlement of property and spousal maintenance. This is both fair and equitable, and in line with the Howard government's commitment to the implementation of positive reforms to child support arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must comment on the breathtaking audacity of the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) during his contribution to this debate. The member for Werriwa has suddenly become a latter day champion of reform in the area of child support arrangements. Never mind that, in 13 years of Labor, nothing was done to make the system fairer; never mind that the thousands of Australians who held genuine grievances concerning this matter were ignored by Labor ministers and by an unsympathetic Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know the stories, and I have seen the heartbreak caused by the callous attitude that Labor has towards people. But we now have the member for Werriwa whingeing and complaining  that the Howard coalition government is not doing enough. The honourable member moves amendments designed to play politics with people's sensitivities, yet he does not recognise the absolute failure of his own previous Labor government to do anything to improve the system when they had the chance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We now have substantial reforms before us which will help to make child support arrangements fairer and more equitable. The member for Werriwa ought to reflect on that. He ought to remember that the improvements are taking place under the Howard coalition government. This government has proven willing to listen and act on matters relating to child support. I am very pleased to be able to bring the concerns of my constituents directly to the minister responsible. The establishment of a government committee on the Child Support
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4810"> Agency has enabled government members to voice the concerns of their constituents and work on finding practical solutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were over 6,000 public submissions to the 1994 Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues. This reflects the very real need for the reforms contained within this bill, and for an ongoing process of reform to further improve the system of child support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe in the need for further considered reform to ensure even greater fairness and equity. As I said in my first speech in the House, many constituents feel that the child support formula is unfair because it is calculated on taxable income minus exempt income, rather than on net income, which is the amount of money that the non&hyphen;custodial parent has to live on in real terms. I said at that time, and I say it again today, that I will continue to work towards a fairer system for both custodial and non&hyphen;custodial parents in my electorate of Makin and Australia&hyphen;wide, for the benefit of all children.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to commence by thanking many members for their contributions to the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996. In effect, all members from both sides of the parliament have supported the contents of this bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The number of speakers to this bill indicates the amount of interest in parliament with the operation of the child support scheme. Firstly, I would like to respond to the amendment moved by the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) on behalf of the opposition. For obvious reasons, the government will not be supporting this amendment. As the member for Makin (Mrs Draper) has very adequately and eloquently said, the opposition&mdash;the member for Werriwa in this case&mdash;are moving amendments when they had 13 years to do something about this issue. It is gross hypocrisy to come here and criticise us when we have been in government for only 15 months. We are responding, and we are responding in a very significant way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the record, the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues reported in November 1994. That committee made 163 recommendations for change to the Child Support Agency and to the scheme in general. At the time that the coalition government took office, more than 100 of the recommendations from this committee had not been responded to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those that were addressed by the previous government were largely administrative. The recommendations left to this government, not surprisingly, are more substantive and more complex. For the most part, the remaining recommendations from the report of the joint select committee involve complex issues of equity between separated parents, their children and the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As many members have indicated, the government is giving careful consideration to the operation of the scheme and, in particular, to the remaining recommendations from the report of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues. This is in stark contrast to the previous government. I note with interest the remarks made earlier this week by the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price), chair of the joint select committee, when speaking on his private member's bill in relation to this matter. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it never occurred to me that nearly three years would have elapsed and that only the easiest of the recommendations&mdash;53 in all&mdash;would have been tackled by my government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">the Labor government when they were in power&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and the present government and that the remaining more difficult policy issues would be and continue to be unresponded to . . . In fact, if I reflect on the three years, I am a little surprised that the caucus has never really had an opportunity to vote on these measures or any of the other recommendations.

<PARA STYLE="Para">That is from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> , 2 June, 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the government's first legislative response to recommendations made by the joint select committee. The government recognises that this bill does not address the key issues of the joint select committee. However, the government does not believe that these commonsense reforms should await consideration of the somewhat more substantial issues raised by the joint select committee and many others in the community. Nothing says more about the priority given to child support by the previous government than the fact that the first legislative response to the committee had to await the advent of a coalition government to be introduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill amends the child support legislation to bring it into line with the provisions and concepts of the Social Security Act 1991, the Family Law Act 1975 and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. Each of these acts has undergone change over the last few years without at the time making the necessary consequential changes to child support legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill amends the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 to adopt the thrust of recommendation 124 of the joint select committee on the use of income estimates. This amendment will allow estimates for the most part to have a prospective effect only. This will reduce the incidence of overpayments to persons receiving child support by removing the retrospective effect of the current income estimate provisions. The bill amends the Child Support (Registration Collection) Act 1988 to enable parents who pay child support to elect to pay directly to the register. This amendment adopts recommendations 55 through to 57 of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues. It reduces the level of intrusiveness of the child support scheme where payers voluntarily comply with their child support obligations and over time may reduce the administrative and compliance costs of the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment provides a better balance between the need for regular financial support for children of separated parents and the rights of parents to privacy. The bill also amends the Family Law Act 1975 to allow the courts to take into account the child support liability of a person in property and spousal maintenance proceedings, even where a child support assessment has not been issued. The amendment responds to recommendations 156 of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reforms proposed in the bill are responsible. They remove some significant and frequent causes for complaint from payers and recipients of child support. They are, to use the words of the member for Dunkley (Mr Billson) `human and responsive reforms'.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Firstly, an independent evaluation of the National Drug Strategy has just been completed. The evaluation addressed the advisory and wider consultative mechanisms in place through the National Drug Strategy. The evaluation team, led by Professor Eric Single of the Department of Preventive Medicine and Biostatistics in the University of Toronto and Professor Tim Rohl of the Australian Graduate School of Police Management in Charles Sturt University, received written submissions and held discussions with expert researchers, service providers, community groups and consumer organisations. The report of the evaluation will be discussed by the Australasian Police Ministers' Council and the Australian Health Minister's Conference at their respective meetings in July 1997. These meetings are expected to look at the future directions of the National Drug Strategy and particularly the incorporation of broader consultative mechanisms as recommended by the evaluators. If such a broad consultative approach can be achieved, a national drug summit will not be necessary.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Handguns have been very tightly regulated in Australia since the 1920s. Their ease of concealment and potential for misuse in criminal activity or accidents has led to the general acceptance that they should be subject to the most stringent controls. Consequently all Australian jurisdictions have required handguns to be registered and owners to be licensed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tests for private access to handguns are so tight in every jurisdiction that, with very few exceptions, they can only be used for the provision of professional security services and competition target shooting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Nationwide Agreement on Firearms, agreed by all Australian governments on 10 May 1996, places the toughest possible controls on the possession, use, sale, resale and transfer of all firearms, including handguns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Applicants for handgun licences must prove both a "genuine reason" for owning, possessing or using a handgun as well as a "genuine need' for that particular firearm.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 1996 Agreement also agreed on minimum standards for the security and storage of handguns. These require that handguns be stored in a locked, steel safe with a thickness to ensure it is not easily penetrable, bolted to the structure of a building, and all ammunition must be stored in locked containers separate from any firearms. Sales of firearms, including by mail order, must be conducted only by or through licensed firearms

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most of the measures in the 1996 Agreement have been implemented by State and Territory governments. However, the Commonwealth Government has also taken steps to control the availability of certain handguns by amending the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations to include as prohibited items any handguns that have a fully automatic firing capability or resemble a sub&hyphen;machine gun, machine pistol or soft air handgun.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government does not have current plans to re&hyphen;examine these stringent controls on the possession, use and sale of handguns, but in line with all firearms issues, there will be careful continuing monitoring.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Nuclear Codes of Practice were central to the 1977 Commonwealth Government decision to mine and export uranium. Under the Commonwealth's Environment Protection (Nuclear Codes) Act 1978 (Nuclear Codes Act), three national codes of practice have been published based on international standards:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i) Code of Practice on the Management of Radioactive Wastes from the Mining and Milling of Radioactive Ores (1982) (`Waste Management Code');</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iii) Code of Practice for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Substances (1990) (`Transport Code').</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Codes provide for radiation safety in the mining and milling of radioactive ores and the transport of radioactive material. They have been developed on a federal consultative basis, with implementation of Code requirements remaining the responsibility of individual Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments under the Nuclear Codes Act. Administration of the Codes is the responsibility of the Department of Health and Family Services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Radioactive Waste Management Code requires development of a waste management program for operations involving the mining and milling of radioactive ores including uranium. The program must be approved by the competent authority. It also requires establishment of a monitoring program, to the satisfaction of the appropriate authority, prior to commencement of construction or development work at the mine or mill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Transport Code sets out strict conditions for the protection of both the public and workers from the effects of radiation during the transport of radioactive materials. Transport of radioactive materials and licensing of
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> radioisotopes is generally handled by State/Territory Health departments in accordance with State/Territory regulations which incorporate Code requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The safety of major shipments of Commonwealth radioactive material is regulated on a case by case basis by the Australian Radiation Laboratory (ARL), with the Nuclear Safety Bureau (NSB) providing advice. As of 1 July 1997 the NSB and ARL will be designated joint Competent Authorities for the purposes of regulating transport of Commonwealth&hyphen;owned radioactive material.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Monitoring the storage of uranium tailings and regulation of the safe transport of uranium is principally the responsibility of State and Territory Governments. However, due to the Commonwealth's involvement in uranium mining in the Northern Territory, the Commonwealth has a more direct role in these activities through the Office of the Supervising Scientist (OSS). The OSS was established to co&hyphen;ordinate and supervise measures for the protection and restoration of the environment of the Alligator Rivers Region (ARR) from the effects of uranium mining. These activities include monitoring the adequacy of tailings storage and the transport of uranium within the ARR.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">From a physical security perspective, the Commonwealth has responsibilities under the Nuclear Non&hyphen;Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987 for transport of fresh and irradiated nuclear fuel and uranium ore concentrates (yellowcake). Under this Act, a system of Permits has been established which requires permit holders to comply with prescriptions laid down by the Australian Safeguards Office (ASO). The requirements of ASO include the physical protection (security) levels to be applied to all movements of `nuclear material' i.e. uranium, thorium and plutonium. Details are laid down in the permits issued to relevant possessors of nuclear material e.g. ANSTO and the two operators of Australia's uranium mines.</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Where the Commonwealth has an interest in the above activities for example, from a physical security perspective, in relation to uranium mining in the ARR, and where radioactive material is Commonwealth owned, a number of Commonwealth agencies are involved as indicated above.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since these activities are only a facet of the many activities undertaken by involved agencies it is not possible to attribute an annual cost.

Research is undertaken by ANSTO scientists, visiting international scientists, university staff and PhD students. The nuclear science and technology research conducted by these parties covers a number of
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4818"> areas including the environment, minerals processing, materials, nuclear safety, physics, biomedicine and health. Further details on the research undertaken by ANSTO can be found in the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation Annual Report, 1995&hyphen;96. Research topics being conducted, using ANSTO facilities, by university staff and students can be found in the Australian Institute of Nuclear Science and Engineering (AINSE) Annual Report 1995. Both these documents are available to the public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) The Government has not made a decision on the method of decommissioning for the Lucas Heights reactor. However, the 1993 Research Reactor Review (RRR) addressed this issue and broadly agreed with the approach to decommissioning proposed by ANSTO, which was to put the reactor under care and maintenance for 30 years and after this period of time make a decision
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> whether to encapsulate the reactor, dismantle it, or extend the care and maintenance period. The estimated cost in the RRR for encapsulation after 30 years care and maintenance was $48.2 million and the estimated cost for dismantling after 30 years was $70.2 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The above costs were based upon the availability of a national facility to accept the radioactive waste generated from decommissioning. The Government is currently conducting a study to locate a national repository site for low&hyphen;level and short&hyphen;lived intermediate level radioactive waste. Radioactive decommissioning wastes which are suitable for near&hyphen;surface disposal, will be disposed of at a national repository.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Long&hyphen;lived intermediate level (Category S) decommissioning wastes, that are not suitable for near&hyphen;surface disposal, could be stored at a national store pending deep disposal. The Department of Primary Industries and Energy advises that the small quantity of Category S waste produced by Australia would not, at present, justify construction of a deep disposal facility. Possible co&hyphen;location of a Category S store with a national near&hyphen;surface repository is being considered by the Commonwealth/State Consultative Committee on Radioactive Waste Management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) There is no proposal for the construction of a research reactor at Jervis Bay and no cost estimates have been made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) There are two cyclotrons in Australia that are used for the production of medical isotopes. These are the National Medical Cyclotron (NMC), situated at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Sydney and operated by the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, and a smaller cyclotron at the Austin Hospital in Melbourne. The medical isotopes produced by these cyclotrons have been listed in the table provided below in reply to Question 8.</PARA>
