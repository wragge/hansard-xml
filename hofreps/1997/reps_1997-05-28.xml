<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The purpose of this bill is to amend part 3 of the Migration Act 1958 which provides for the migration agents registration scheme. The bill amends section 333 of the Migration Act which contains a sunset clause. Under this clause, the migration agents registration scheme will terminate on 21 September 1997, after having operated for five years. The amendment will have the effect of terminating the scheme on 21 March 1998.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members will be aware that the migration agents registration scheme was recently reviewed by a task force within my department. The task force was guided by a reference group headed by Mr Ian Spicer, former 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Chief Executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The review recognised that the migration agents registration scheme had provided a measure of consumer protection and had removed a number of incompetent or unscrupulous operators from the migration advice industry. It was supportive of the industry moving to self-regulation, where its members voluntarily join an industry body and agree to meet the competency and ethical standards set by the body. The body, in turn, sets in place procedures for disciplining members who breach its code of conduct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In considering the task force's report, the government recognised that the migration industry is disparate and lacks a body with sufficient coverage and infrastructure to take on the task of self-regulation at this time. Consequently, the government has decided to introduce a form of statutory self-regulation as a transitional stage, with an eventual move to full self-regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under statutory self-regulation, regulatory power is delegated to an industry body and, subject to an agreement between the body and me, the body takes on the administration and enforcement of regulation. The Migration Institute of Australia is prepared to take on the role of industry regulator and is aware of the parameters under which such an agreement would operate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to improving competency standards and providing an enhanced consumer protection focus through a complaints resolution process, the industry body will also be able to impose disciplinary sanctions against agents who behave in an unethical or grossly unprofessional manner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed six months extension of the existing scheme to 21 March 1998 will enable the government to develop and introduce legislation shortly for this transitional period of statutory self-regulation for the migration advice industry. It will also allow the Migration Institute of Australia time to establish the infrastructure to take on this new self- regulation role. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum.  </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The bill contains no new policy but overcomes technical deficiencies in the way Commonwealth and state family law legislation and rules of court have applied in Western Australia. Western Australia is the only state to have its own family court. The bill is designed to complement Western Australian legislation addressing these deficiencies from within the legislative capabilities of that state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will create family law rights and liabilities for the many people who may be affected by a recent decision of the Full Court of the Family Court of Australia in the matter of Horne v. Horne, 13 February 1997, Appeal No. WA 13 of 1996. In that case, the Full Family Court held that the family law rule that purportedly allowed registrars of the Family Court of Western Australia to exercise the power to make consent orders was invalid. As a result, many consent orders made by registrars in Western Australia are ineffective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill will overcome this problem by ensuring that all affected people in Western Australia obtain enforceable, statutory family law rights and liabilities that mirror the rights and liabilities that would have been created by valid registrars' orders. The approach taken in the bill is based on a similar one approved by the High Court in R v. Humby ex parte Rooney (1973) 129 CLR 231, and subsequently in cases such as Polyukhovic v. the Commonwealth (1991) 172 CLR 500. This approach does not attempt to validate the purported orders made by registrars. Instead, it creates new statutory rights and liabilities 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that may be exercised and enforced in the same manner as orders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will not have any significant financial impact. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill and commend the bill to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, the government and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) are well aware of the importance of Townsville in the national economy. Last night I spoke extensively about my city, about how well the city is going and how indeed I believe it will probably be the fastest growing regional city in this country in the next year or so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4203">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I spoke about matters such as the importance of the sports and entertainment industry in the city where our football team, which is a member of the Super League, is attracting crowds as big as any team in the country except the Broncos. I spoke about how, even last week, the Broncos were unable to beat us, even on their home ground.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I spoke about how the Townsville Suns in the basketball are in fact third in the national league at the moment, which is a very creditable effort. I spoke about how they have established a professional sports record with 58 consecutive sell&hyphen;out home games of 4,500 people in the Furnace, which is in the Townsville Entertainment Centre. I alerted the parliament to the fact that, because we are filling these 4,500 places, we are going to extend that Entertainment Centre to 6,000 places&mdash;which is a great result for Australia's largest tropical city.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I spoke last night about the importance of the Australian Defence Force. I indicated to my colleagues that in my city we have Australia's largest defence base. We also have the Operational Deployment Unit, which is the unit that responds, within a set period of time, in the case of a national emergency. There is an awful lot of money going into that particular sector of the Townsville economy&mdash;millions and millions of dollars in terms of 10 Terminal Regiment, 5 Aviation Regiment, the Townsville Field Training Area and the new, modern, high frequency communications system which is based in Townsville.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I spoke to you about minerals development, and the fact that we are servicing the largest zinc deposit and mine in the world. And Century Zinc is yet to come on stream as well. We have a billion dollar investment in a new minerals processing facility which will process both zinc and lead, and that will complement the two mineral refineries that already exist in the city&mdash;namely, copper and nickel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I spoke last night about the importance of James Cook University and how that university last year secured the lion's share of research grants for regional universities, and that is because James Cook is leading the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> world in such things as marine science, sports science and earth science.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I alerted the parliament to the fact that Townsville airport once again has resumed international services. I am fiercely proud of the state of Queensland, of course, and I can state that it has three international airports&mdash;which no other state can match&mdash;and Townsville airport is one of those. Milne Bay Air has established flights into New Guinea, which I certainly trust will be a great success.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also spoke about road development in the city, the importance of the national highway, and how I was able to secure $21.5 million for the northern approach to the city. That is great news. I was certainly very proud to turn the first soil on that project last week. Mr Speaker, I had to drive a grader to do that; you would have been proud of me. If I lose my job here, I certainly have another job to go to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Stemming directly from the government's financial responsibility, home buyers and small businesses in Townsville and throughout Australia are now beginning to see some real benefits. Interest rates have fallen 3.55 per cent since the coalition was elected. That is starting to filter through to my electorate. The real estate industry tells me that they are looking forward to a very good year. Home buyers can now access home loan rates as low as 6.99 per cent, meaning that home buyers in Townsville and Thuringowa can make interest savings of $292 per month&mdash;and that is after tax. It is the equivalent of a $100&hyphen;a&hyphen;week wage rise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For small businesses, after years of rising taxes, it has taken a Howard coalition government to start turning that around. Provisional tax has been cut; fringe benefits tax has been cut and, on 1 July, capital gains tax will be cut, representing a significant easing of the burden on small business. The coalition certainly has paved the way for strong and consistent growth and, in time, Townsville&mdash;and indeed all of Australia&mdash;will benefit.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the now Prime Minister, John Howard, took the stage at the Wentworth Hotel on the evening of 2 March 1996, as he waved to a sea of Liberal Party supporters and campaign 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4204"> workers and suffered the glare of the television lights and all the camera&hyphen;flashes, he used in his victory speech the inclusive language Australians expected from their soon&hyphen;to&hyphen;be leader. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government that I will lead will be a Government not only for the people who voted for us but also for the people who voted against us.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He said the things that united Australians `were infinitely more important and more enduring than the things that divided Australians.' He spoke about `unity', `cohesion' and `a common point of view'. He spoke about `fairness' and `understanding', `good government', and `the welfare of all of the Australian people'. The Prime Minister, the member for Bennelong, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will focus on the those things that bind us together, I will focus on our strengths, I will defend the interests and the values and the principles of this country both domestically and internationally.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He waved to the crowd again, hugged his wife and children, posed for some photos and walked off the stage with the applause and the shouts of joy still ringing in his ears.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And then he quickly and effortlessly forgot. He did not forget the applause or the congratulations; the backslaps and outstretched hands followed him around Australia for the next 10 months. He did not forget the momentous nature of his new position: he certainly had the trappings of Kirribilli House and the demanding schedule to remind him he was indeed the Prime Minister. He did not forget the pressures of office; he has had us to remind him of those every day of the week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the Prime Minister forgot was that he promised to govern the nation with an eye to bringing us together, not forcing us further apart. What the Prime Minister forgot was that he said he was going to govern for all of us equally&mdash;for those who had voted against his party and those who had voted for it. What he forgot was that he said he would govern with fairness and understanding and that under his government Australians would feel more secure&mdash;secure in their jobs, secure in their families and secure for the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why do I say that he forgot all these things? Well, he must have forgotten because, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> as we all know, one cannot accuse another member of lying in this place. He must have forgotten because, as I look around my electorate, I do not see the face of a fair and understanding government. As my constituents now meet me in my office and stop me in the street, I do not hear from them the good news about how even-handedly they are being treated by this government. I am hearing about how very much more unsure they are feeling, how their future is far more grim, how they are going to have to struggle even harder to keep their families together&mdash;more so now than they have ever had to before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister must have forgotten because in Prospect I do not see a community uniting as a result of this government's policies. I see a community dividing and falling apart. I see our local hospitals under threat from the $800 million ripped out of our public health system by this government. I see our young people unable to reach their full potential and obtain a university education, blocked by the increases in HECS and the $623 million ripped out of higher education. I see our long-term unemployed wasting away on the dole queue with no job training and little or no hope because of the $2 billion which is now earmarked for removal from the country's labour market programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I see the despondency and the social dislocation which is a natural follow&hyphen;on from such endemic and untreated joblessness. I have seen the heroin trade spread insidiously and with great effect through the suburbs of my electorate over the last 12 months. Because of the abolition of operational subsidies for community based child care, I see working mums and dads starting to take their kids out of regulated and accredited community child care and place them in unregulated, backyard operations. These parents can no longer afford the extra $20 to $47 per child per week, on top of what they have had to pay. These are the increases my local councils have been forced into making by this government, come 1 July.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I see the elderly suffering constant pain and the indignity of spending their days eating soup and mashed vegetables because they have been told they cannot get their dentures 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4205"> replaced until heaven knows when, now that the Commonwealth dental program has been cut to shreds. I see the elderly in my electorate frightened and unsure as they face the prospect of being forced to sell their own homes to get a bed in a nursing home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I see Fairfield Legal Aid having to shut its doors to genuinely needy clients, turning people away as it and the entire legal aid system prepares itself and its meagre funds for the $120 million cuts which will come into effect on 1 July. I see Liberal Party senators coming into my electorate from Watsons Bay smiling and shaking our hands and waving about cheques for flood mitigation, as if we should be thankful we received any money at all after the urban flood mitigation program and its level of recurrent funding have now been abolished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the Australia the Prime Minister and this government have given the people of Prospect in barely 15 months. Now, following this May budget, the latest chapter in what can only be described as an increasingly bitter story, I do not imagine that people in my electorate or throughout Australia are expecting it to get any better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Looking at this latest budget, the people of Prospect have a right to believe that the Howard Government has chosen to look after its natural, more privileged constituencies at the expense of some of the most disadvantaged areas of Australia. The Treasurer's savings rebate scheme provides a striking example of the way in which the Howard government has washed its hands of Australia's working poor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Forget the dishonest and shameful way in which this budget measure betrays the coalition's rock solid commitment to match Labor's superannuation co&hyphen;contribution scheme. Forget the fact that the superannuation and retirement incomes policy that the coalition took to the last election stated, `The coalition will meet the government's co&hyphen;contribution commitment.' Forget that just for the moment. Let us instead take a look at what this supposedly new, improved policy does to benefit the people of Prospect, some of Australia's most disadvantaged families&mdash;especially when compared with what it will 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> do for the multi&hyphen;millionaires of Wollstonecraft and Kirribilli.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the suburbs of Prairiewood, Bossley Park, Abbotsbury and Greenfield Park in my electorate, the mean taxable income, based on 1994&hyphen;95 tax office figures, is $26,355. The average amount of interest received on savings is $597. How much has the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia calculated that a person earning these amounts will receive from the government's savings rebate scheme? Ninety dollars per year&mdash;a lousy $1.73 a week. That is less than the cost of a loaf of bread at the supermarket.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The picture does not get much rosier elsewhere in my electorate. In the suburb of Prospect itself, the average rebate has been calculated at $97&mdash;$1.86 a week. In Carramar and Villawood the average rebate will be $103&mdash;a meagre $2 a week. In Smithfield, Fairfield, Wetherill Park, Horsley Park, Fairfield West and Fairfield Heights, the average rebate is going to be roughly $2.20 per week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Treasurer and the Prime Minister have tried to deceive the people of Prospect with all their talk about $450 rebates when for my constituents the reality is very different. I will let the Prime Minister and his Treasurer in on what is common knowledge around my way but what for them might come as a bit of a surprise. The majority of my constituents have not got $1,000 saved up in the bank, let alone the $60,000 needed to get the full $450 benefit from this scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most of the families in my electorate use virtually every ounce of their income to keep their households together&mdash;to pay off the mortgage, pay the rent, pay for the kids' clothes, put food on the table&mdash;the basic stuff that this government should be caring about. They have little or none of the disposable income to play with, to rack up the huge levels of savings which are required to gain the full up&hyphen;front benefits of this scheme. That is how the scheme short&hyphen;changes the people of Prospect in the short term. What about the long term?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people of Prospect, especially the young men and women who are in their late twenties and early thirties and who are still at 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4206"> the beginning of their working lives, the people who will really need the support of a strong superannuation scheme by the time they have reached retirement age, have been robbed by this government. They have been ripped off to the tune of around $100,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The average worker living in Fairfield&mdash;the average so&hyphen;called `Howard battler'&mdash;who is perhaps 35 years of age and is earning about $700 a week, would have retired at 65 under Labor's superannuation scheme with a superannuation benefit of around $280,000. Now, thanks to the betrayal of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, this worker's final benefit will be around $170,000. That is a loss of around 40 per cent, or $110,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister and the Treasurer are quite obviously working on the principle of `what they don't have now, they won't miss later'. They are hoping that a little sleight of hand, a little `watch me pull a rabbit out of my hat', will allow them to get away with what is palpably clear to all. And that is that the people of my electorate have had their future means cut out from under them on a scale never before seen, let alone contemplated. It is a heist on a scale which beggars the imagination, and in the process they are robbing the nation of the $400 billion which would have been a part of our national savings pool by the year 2020 under Labor's superannuation scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another front on which my electorate will take no solace from this Budget is unemployment. I am not only referring to the legions of unemployed in the Fairfield&hyphen;Liverpool region who will look at this budget with dismay for what it does, or should I say does not do, about creating jobs. I am talking about the families, friends and relatives who have to watch their parents and children go for months with no employment prospects and none likely to emerge. I am talking about the thousands of people who work in Prospect who are feeling increasingly insecure in their jobs and wondering how they and their families will cope if unemployment should befall them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last budget, the coalition axed $1.8 billion from labour market programs around the country which were designed to get long&hyphen; 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">term unemployed Australians back to work. In this budget, an extra $320 million has been cut from vocational and skills training and general assistance to job seekers. Spending overall on labour programs falls by $300 million. Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is preparing for the dole queues to lengthen by putting aside an extra $200 million to pay for unemployment benefits&mdash;a move which exposes just how much he believes his own rhetoric about reducing unemployment over the next 12 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead of attempting to tackle the unemployment queues in Prospect and throughout Australia head on&mdash;my area, incidentally, has the highest unemployment rate in New South Wales and the second highest in Australia&mdash;instead of providing the long&hyphen;term unemployed with training and new skills, what we get in Prospect is the Prime Minister's supposed master stroke&mdash;work for the dole&mdash;a puerile answer to unemployment if ever there was one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For Prospect, work for the dole really means having our young people&mdash;not the young people of the north shore or the eastern suburbs of Sydney, remember&mdash;cutting edges and picking up garbage for the privilege of receiving their unemployment benefit. That is what it means.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Work for the dole has failed before it has even begun because it contains no training component and thus fails to provide participants with the skills they need if they are to have any hope of gaining employment in fields where work still exists. The selective nature of the scheme exposes the Prime Minister's guarantee to govern fairly and equitably&mdash;irrespective of where you live or the levels of unemployment in your community&mdash;as lip service of the highest order.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Work for the dole is a cheap, populist gimmick at best. The fact that the Prime Minister of Australia is willing to manipulate the young people of my electorate as the guinea pigs in this ridiculous sham is, quite frankly, disgusting. Meanwhile, the drug abuse, the family breakdown, the crime and juvenile delinquency&mdash;the spin&hyphen;offs of unemployment in Prospect&mdash;only get worse.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4207">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are seeing now is sad confirmation of what Voltaire said over 200 years ago: `Work banishes those three great evils&mdash;boredom, vice and poverty.' With the current absence of work opportunities in Prospect, I can assure the Prime Minister, we have all three evils in spades.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other three great negative messages the government has sent the people of Prospect in this budget are in relation to child care, community welfare and pharmaceuticals. The decision in this budget to rip operational subsidies away from outside school hours child care can be seen in no other way by the parents of my electorate than another Howard government attack upon disadvantaged families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As centres are forced to raise their fees to make up for their axed subsidy, and as parents who cannot afford such an increase remove their kids from care, we are going to see an explosion in the number of latchkey kids in my electorate. Thanks to this measure, parents in Prospect will be forced into giving their eight&hyphen;, nine&hyphen; and 10&hyphen;year&hyphen;old kids a key and telling them to sit and watch the television until mum and dad get home from work. The consequences of such actions are on the Prime Minister's head.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's decision to close Fairfield's family resource centre, Ettinger House, takes another link out of my electorate's welfare safety net. Ettinger House assists the disadvantaged in the Fairfield area find the support services they need, especially in regard to domestic violence, drug and alcohol abuse and unemployment. Are we going to watch women from non&hyphen;English speaking backgrounds suffer abuse in silence now that this essential service is to disappear? The prospects of this occurring are very real.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fairfield is an area of special need. We need services like the family resource centre at Ettinger House to fight the effects of joblessness in our community. Its closure is another shining example of the coalition's callous attitude towards the disadvantaged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Meanwhile, the sick and the elderly are being made to pay more for their medication. The bottom line here is that if your doctor chooses to prescribe a more expensive drug 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> because of its effectiveness and the fact it has fewer side effects, you could pay up to $20 or more for a script.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for the medicines that have been taken off the pharmaceutical benefits list altogether&mdash;the drugs for skin complaints, stomach problems, diarrhoea and muscle pain&mdash;the people who need these medicines face an increase of $9 a script. How does this fit with the Prime Minister's desire to govern for the welfare of all Australians? As the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) stated, `This is a directionless budget.' It is a do&hyphen;nothing budget, and as such confirms for us all that we have a do&hyphen;nothing Prime Minister and a do&hyphen;nothing government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When he was in opposition the Prime Minister used to take stands. We on this side of politics may have disagreed with most of his views but at least we could respect the strength of his convictions then. Now, as Prime Minister, a role which demands of its office&hyphen;holder the very highest levels of leadership and a willingness to state one's case and one's vision for the sake of the country's future, the member for Bennelong's convictions, our Prime Minister's convictions, have turned to jelly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only things he believes in now are the opinion polls. The only policy directions he believes in taking are the ones his party headquarters told him went down well with the market research group on the previous weekend. The only stances he takes are on issues which are likely to win a few plaudits on talkback radio the next morning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only cuts the Prime Minister makes are to areas where he considers the political fallout will be the easiest to overcome, where the cries of protest will be the smallest&mdash;never mind if those cries come from some of the weakest sections of our communities. This is despite the fact that in another life the Prime Minister said: `If we lapse into cheap populism the future of this country will be at risk.' Yet here we have a budget soaked to the gills in populist measures such as the savings rebate scheme, work for the dole and the Federation `slush' Fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget confirms that the coalition is devoid of strong and intelligent ideas, and as 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4208"> such will continue to be mired in indecision&mdash;much to the country's misfortune. It adds to the insecurity and apprehension the people of Prospect are feeling at levels unsurpassed in recent times.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the wide tree lined avenues of Roseville and Killara, in the harbourside mansions of Kirribilli and Mosman, in the boutique shopping districts of Rose Bay and Double Bay, residents have a federal government looking out for them and their interests, but not in western Sydney or in my electorate. In Prospect we have a Prime Minister and a government ignoring us; an inattentive and insensitive government that is oblivious to the problems that we face and the problems they are creating. What is more, they do not care to listen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All the people of my electorate want is to be governed with the equal hand promised by the Prime Minister during his victory speech on election day last year. I do not believe that that is too much to ask. Judging by the Prime Minister's latest budget, we now have a leader who thinks that it is. We now have a leader and a government who seem to think they govern for those they care about and to hell with the rest of the people of Australia. I condemn this budget for the meanness of it. I condemn this budget because it does not project Australia into the future. I particularly condemn this budget and the coalition for dividing this country even further.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a feature of our adversarial form of politics that governments propose and oppositions oppose. The contribution by the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio), while I am sure well meaning, was certainly so negative that I found that the remarks I intend to make bear no resemblance whatsoever to the contribution from the honourable member. I wonder sometimes whether we have read the same documents, whether we are really considering the same issues or whether we represent constituents in the same country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a budget about employment not unemployment. This is a budget about future employment for Australians. Why do I say that? The budget promises us a fairly contemporary reduction in interest rates. Why is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> interest rates being low good for us? Because it means that Australians at whatever income level can buy houses or obtain credit at reduced costs. The incomes of Australians at all levels&mdash;low, medium and high&mdash;are dramatically higher today than when this government took over after the March 1996 election. That is because interest rates have fallen dramatically.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time, we are experiencing very low and falling inflation. Low inflation is good for Australia and it is good for business. It helps give business the confidence that they can build, they can design, they can produce under a financial atmosphere that is stable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Industry needs certainty in order to provide jobs. This budget goes a long way towards providing the kind of certainty that industry has asked for for years. It is, in a sense, a bit of a steady as you go budget, accepting that the Commonwealth government has made a dramatic effort to turn around a budget deficit to a budget surplus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the life of the first Howard government we will see budget projections fall from a budget deficit of $10.3 billion&mdash;that is, the Commonwealth's call on the savings of average Australians&mdash;to a budget surplus of $1.6 billion. That is a remarkable achievement. Business and industry cannot help but respond to the initiative that the government, the public sector, is reducing its call on Australia's savings and is actually contributing to Australia's savings overall. The reduced debt is actually very dramatic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the coming financial year we will repay over $5 billion of debt. For the first time in nearly 10 years the Commonwealth will not run up any debt, it will not call on the savings of Australians and it will not be a borrower in the marketplace. That is fantastic for industry. It provides industry more scope to find the funds that they need to fund expansion and growth in their operating costs within the Australian economy without having to seek funds from overseas to the same extent that they did in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The turnaround from deficit to surplus is very dramatic. It provides industry with so much scope. That is just incredible. Interest rates are now, as the Treasurer (Mr Costello) 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4209"> said yesterday, at a 28&hyphen;year low. 1969 was the last year that variable interest rates for housing loans were this low. That was the year that I came to Australia. That is almost 30 years ago. In the meantime, we have had the Whitlam government absolutely blow interest rates out of the water. We had the Hawke and Keating governments give us the greatest recession that we have had since the Great Depression. This government is now bringing down the deficit spending proclivity of Labor and turning it around to the Commonwealth actually becoming a net saver. Interest rates are responding to that and I think that is fantastic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing that we can say about low interest is that when we went into the last election and talked about industrial relations reform we said that we wanted Australians to be able to have secure jobs and increased incomes, but that those incomes should be based on improvements in productivity. It is worthy of note that while inflation is at two per cent and falling, wage rates have grown at less than five per cent but more than four per cent providing Australians with greater disposable income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a gross income sense Australians are far ahead of where they were when we took over from the failed Keating government. At the same time interest payments for housing mortgage loans and for general spending and credit card spending are dramatically down providing after tax income returns of as much as $5,000 a year for an average Australian family. That is good for families. It is good for the economy. It is good for jobs. It is good for growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time that we have low interest rates and low inflation, yesterday we learned that new private capital spending rose 6.5 per cent in the March quarter. Capital spending was 18.6 per cent higher than in the same quarter last year. What does that mean? That means that industry and business and commerce are investing in new productive capacity, in new ventures and in new buildings to conduct their businesses in. That investment means new jobs for Australians, perhaps not today but, as the investment is realised, as they put plant and equipment into factories, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> as they build new production lines, as they purchase new systems to operate their businesses more effectively, more Australians will find jobs, and there will be a greater job market for those who need work. Equipment, plant and machinery investment rose 5.5 per cent in the quarter to be 10.1 per cent higher than at the same time last year. We know that means future jobs. As I said in the beginning, this is a budget about employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a whole range of initiatives in the budget that will help encourage Australians to find jobs, that will improve the job prospects of those particularly young people who need assistance to obtain the skills that are so necessary for them to find not only any employment but good, enjoyable employment that is productive and gives them an opportunity to really participate in the life of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Almost $6 billion has been allocated for employment assistance over the next four years. There are improved national literacy and numeracy skills programs for young people to gain more confidence. I have spoken in this place many times&mdash;so has the opposition member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis)&mdash;about the skills deficit that we have in literacy and numeracy in Australia. This government is paying attention to what the surveys have told us about the deficit that we have, with as much as 30 per cent of our youth not having adequate literacy and numeracy skills to serve them well in the job market that they will ultimately try to enter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is to our shame that we deny any young Australian the right to fully participate in our society, the right to have a meaningful job, because we have not taught them how to read and write in English and how to count and multiply and divide. New national literacy programs will help attack this deficit and help give young people increasing confidence. A new $1,500 completion payment for employers whose apprentices or trainees achieve Australian qualification framework level 3 competency will help encourage employers to put on more apprentices and more trainees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's entire approach since coming into office has been to try to lift the number of new apprenticeships and new 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4210"> traineeships that apply to industry where we have not had such mechanisms before. The whole intent of government action is to make more opportunity available to those young people who will not go on to university, and I remind the House that at least 75 per cent of our young people on leaving school will not access university. Some of them, perhaps 10 per cent, will go on and achieve a higher qualification at TAFE, leaving about 65 per cent of our young people who will go directly into the work force and obtain their skills on the job or will attain some qualification or some skill classification through apprenticeships, through traineeships, through part-time TAFE, through out of work hours study, through whatever mechanism in order to help give them entry level skills that will allow them to progress through their jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Through this budget, we will extend vocational education and training to students in year 9 and year 10 in secondary schools who are in danger of leaving school and dropping out of the system altogether. I have to say that this is an initiative that I am particularly proud of. There are schools in my electorate and in surrounding electorates that have been extremely concerned about this issue for a long time, as are schools around Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Teachers tell us that they know generally those young people who enter high school in year 9 who are already at risk of dropping out of the system. Those who drop out at an early age have little chance of obtaining full-time employment and have little chance of progressing through employment to any sort of job career or satisfying employment. They generally wind up on the unemployment scrap heap. They may wind up in our penal institutions; they may wind up with drug and alcohol dependency problems. They need the skills that they obtain at school. They need the discipline of attending school and the discipline of learning in an active environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So that money is designed through the Australian Student Traineeship Foundation to assist schools to help those young people who are at risk of dropping out of the school system. Some of those programs will probably involve a change in the curriculum, allowing 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> those students to spend up to two days a week at work while they complete their studies during the other three days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The work component of the programs simply gives the students a reason for continuing with their education. It allows them to see that there can be real jobs at the end of the formal time in school. What those real jobs are all about is the kind of satisfaction that comes from going to work and doing a job and contributing to the company and contributing to society. So those sorts of curriculum initiatives will help encourage the young people to stay on at school. I congratulate the minister and the government for including that initiative in this budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be more than $45 million over four years for the community support program to assist some 250,000 job seekers. People with special needs will undergo a formal special needs assessment. Participants will receive individual tailored assistance to help them overcome their barriers to employment and to help make them job ready. The new enterprise incentives scheme will continue within the employment services market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Extended assistance packages for the pharmaceutical industry to the year 2005 are another issue that particularly pleases me. Our pharmaceutical industry has prospered and has grown dramatically under the factor F scheme. I have always congratulated John Button for picking up that initiative and putting it in place, because our pharmaceutical industry was dying. There is no question about that. Since the scheme came into operation, our investment in research and development, our investment in new plant and new capacity, our investment in new jobs and our dramatic improvement in exports have been well documented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government, to its credit, has continued that scheme in a manner which is complementary to World Trade Organisation requirements and gives the pharmaceutical industry further certainty. In addition to that, the government has extended the patent life for pharmaceuticals by an additional five years, recognising the very long and expensive time between the discovery of a new chemical entity, toxicology trials, clinical 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4211"> trials and the final production and marketing of a new drug, recognising that there is a very long lead time between discovering the chemical entity and actually hitting the marketplace. The costs sometimes are absolutely staggering.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Glaxo, a major pharmaceutical manufacturer in my electorate, is now attempting to develop the flu drug. Hopefully, this initiative by the Commonwealth government will encourage the Glaxo board in London to allow the plant in Boronia to manufacture the flu drug when the clinical trials are finished and manufacture it for the whole world market. There have been estimates that that initiative could gain Australia as much as $1 billion a year in export income. That certainly will be good for jobs and good for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The work for the dole scheme is also another initiative that will help employment. It will not generate jobs. It was never designed to generate jobs. It will not even necessarily generate the skills that are necessary for particular career paths in industry. What it will do is give young people the confidence that they can participate, give them some sense of reality in actually doing something that is creative and help make them feel that they are participating in society and fulfilling half of their compact, if you will, with the Australian society&mdash;where society is taking care of them during their time of not having employment, they put something back into the community. That can be only positive, both for the people who work under the work for the dole scheme and also for those communities which pick it up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Prospect talked about the savings initiative in the budget and what some people in her electorate save now. I think the honourable member missed the point. The point is that the initiative is there to encourage people to save more than they are saving now or, if they are saving nothing, to save something. That is what it is all about. For the first time that anyone can remember in the history of tax initiatives coming out of this Commonwealth parliament there is an actual positive initiative to encourage people to save. It says that you get a rebate off your taxes if you save.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Talking about what people save now is not what it is all about. It is what people will save in the future as a result of the initiative. The recent modelling work that has been done by Morgan and Banks clearly indicated that the majority of the initiative will go to those on low and medium incomes. That is precisely what it was designed to do. It will recompense every Australian, regardless of their income level, some amount for their savings, but those who receive the greatest benefit are those on low and moderate incomes. The savings initiative is a good initiative for Australia. It is a first and I am certain that it will accomplish its objectives over time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very pleased to say to the House that the Commonwealth government agreed to up the ante to the ABC by over $13 million a year, which will help ameliorate some of the effects of the budget cuts to the ABC announced in August last year. The ABC now receives $500 million a year. That funding is guaranteed over the next three years in real terms&mdash;not in nominal terms&mdash;adjusted for inflation. So the ABC now can plan with certainty to restructure its operation in order to become more efficient and more effective and to use our taxpayers' dollars in a better manner. I am pleased that the ABC management themselves have complimented the Commonwealth government on that initiative.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This budget is a budget that clearly is without direction. It is a budget that is without leadership. It is a budget without a plan.

It is just like the Prime Minister (Mr Howard); it is a mirror reflection of his leadership&mdash;the meandering government that we have become used to in the last six to 12 months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a budget that does nothing to address the worsening economic situation that Australia confronts. It does nothing about the slowing consumer demand. It does nothing about the growing number of Australians out of work. It does nothing to create job oppor 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4212"> tunities. It certainly does nothing to provide job security for those Australians still in employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We now face a lost year, a lost opportunity. This is the Clayton's budget&mdash;some people will recall the old Clayton's drink&mdash;this is the budget you have when you are not having a budget. This is a standstill, a waste of 12 months, a lost opportunity, for the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government heralded the budget for its drive to return Commonwealth budgets to surplus. Indeed, just about every speaker on the government side makes a point of talking about this as the feature. There is not much else they could hang a hat on in a debate on the budget other than to refer to that. But even in that area the government has misrepresented the situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The budget papers themselves identify that the underlying deficit in 1997&hyphen;98 will be $3 billion or 0.6 per cent of GDP; that is, we are still running a deficit this year. On the budget's projections, that is, if everything the government says will occur does in fact occur&mdash;I will go to that in a minute because they did not do too well last year predicting how the economy would go&mdash;we have to wait until 1998&hyphen;99 before the government will find itself in surplus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is normally coupled with rhetoric from Liberal&hyphen;National Party members telling the parliament what a terrible legacy they were left with, what a terrible debt the former government put in their hands. It is about time we dispelled that in cold hard facts. There have been only three surplus budgets recorded by the Commonwealth since the Second World War. I do not have records going back beyond that. I think the accounting system changed around 1950 anyway. Unfortunately, the budget papers that this government produces stop at 1984-85. When we were in government we produced tables that went back to the 1950s so people could get a good idea of how the government was performing compared with previous governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The simple fact of the matter is this: from the end of the Second World War until now there have been three surplus budgets. This 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> budget, on the government's own admission, will not be a surplus budget. They will be in debt again this year. The only three budgets that any Commonwealth government has delivered in the period since the Second World War&mdash;in 50 years&mdash;with an underlying surplus were in fact Labor government budgets of the Hawke&hyphen;Keating period. They were the budgets of 1987&hyphen;88, 1988&hyphen;89 and 1989&hyphen;90. In 50 years the Commonwealth has managed only three surplus budgets and every one of them was a Labor budget in the last period of Labor's term in office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has inherited an economy and a budgetary situation for the Commonwealth which is historically at its best. When we came to office in 1983, inheriting a budget and an economy from the former Liberal government, whose Treasurer at that time was John Howard, we inherited a deficit that amounted to $24 billion in today's terms&mdash;more than 2&half; times the deficit that they inherited and that they complain about. The undeniable fact is that the only governments that have produced a surplus, the only governments that have managed not to draw on overseas or public funds to fund their budgetary outlays, have been Labor governments led by Paul Keating or by Bob Hawke.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should put paid to the argument that government members trot out every debate on budgetary matters, and usually in question time as well, to try to cry poor about their situation. In fact, their situation is remarkably good&mdash;so good that, were we in Europe, Australia would be one of, I think, three countries that would be eligible to enter the European Union currency. Most of the countries in Europe have a much worse budgetary and debt situation than does Australia. Australia sits at the top of the international list in terms of the range of tests that the European Union applies for entry into the common currency. Our position is indeed a good one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other interesting thing out of the budget papers that I am always keen to look at is the government's own assessment of what they think will happen in the economy, how they think things will go. The two key measures are the estimated performance of gross domestic product and what the government sees 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4213"> as the unemployment rate. Gross domestic product&mdash;that is, how much the national cake will grow by, how much more wealth we will generate in this country, the growth of the things we make&mdash;in the last year we were in office grew by 4.1 per cent. Last year, the first year of the Liberal government, that fell to 3.25 per cent on the budget's own estimate. A year ago when the last budget was introduced the government and the Treasurer said that they would get growth going along at 3&half; per cent. That is, their aim was to have slower growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had it running at 4.1 per cent just two years ago. Last year their ambition was to slow the economy down to 3.5 per cent because they were not capable of maintaining the growth. Growth is critical if you want to maintain jobs, particularly with an increased participation rate with more Australians wanting work. Last year they set out not to make the economy grow faster than it did in our last year in office, not even to make it grow as fast as we did, but to slow it down to 3.5 per cent, and they could not even do that. Their own budget now shows it running at 3.25 per cent. It went from 4.1 per cent under us to 3.25 per cent in the space of a year. They have slowed the economy down. That is why jobs are not available, that is why people are losing job security and that is why the unemployed are finding it hard to get a job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what do they think is going to happen with growth in the economy in the next 12 months? The budget papers predict that they will have a leap from their current abysmal performance of 3.25 per cent and that it will grow half a per cent to 3&frac34; per cent. They have now set themselves a target of growth which, based on their efforts last year when their ambition was not to make the economy grow but to make it smaller&mdash;and they could not even achieve that low ambition&mdash;few observers believe they will achieve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The interesting comparison is what the budget papers say our trading partners will do. Bear in mind that at the moment the Australian economy is operating at 3.25 per cent growth. The budget estimates that our major trading partners will grow their econo 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> mies at 4&half; per cent. So the people we do business with in the world will have a growth in their economies of 4&half; per cent. What is the Howard&hyphen;Costello government's plan for Australia? If they can reach it, it is to grow at 3&frac34;per cent&mdash;three&hyphen;quarters of a per cent less than our trading partners, a significant growth on the last year. Given their performance of being unable to even maintain the former year's growth, that is a fairly ambitious target.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unemployment is the crux of government responsibility, particularly at this time, when we know from all indicators that the economy is slowing, that business confidence is poor and that job security is worse now than it was 12 months ago. The budget papers show that when we left office unemployment was 8.5 per cent in 1995&hyphen;96. Last year, in its first budget, what was the Howard&hyphen;Costello government's aim for Australia? What did it want to reduce unemployment by? The answer is zero.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year, the government stood before the people and said they wanted unemployment to be 8.5 per cent. They did not even set themselves a goal of reducing unemployment in the last budget, but they could not even reach that. They could not even ensure that unemployment did not get worse. The budget papers demonstrate that unemployment is now expected in this year to average out at 8&frac34;per cent. It has gone up. So what do they say is going to happen in the next 12 months? They predict that unemployment will fall from its current high of 8.75 per cent down to 8.25 per cent. They reckon they are going to take half a per cent off unemployment while the economy grows at less than four per cent. There is no&hyphen;one in the economic community who believes that is possible unless, of course, through other measures, such as removal of child-care support and a whole range of other things, they actually force people out of the marketplace&mdash;people who are looking for jobs today and say, `I give up. I can't get a job. Things are so bad I won't even put my name down and try to get a job.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the only way they will get the unemployment figure down. They will get it down by reducing the number of Australians who are looking for a job, because the widely 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4214"> accepted view is that, to make unemployment fall in Australia, you need to run the economy at a growth rate of about four per cent. Even if all of their predictions come true&mdash;and, given that they got them all wrong last year, you do not hold out much hope that they will be right this year&mdash;and even if everything they wanted came true, their own estimate, their own target, is that the economy will grow at less than the required four per cent. No&hyphen;one is going to take that seriously. These are the principles that underpin the budget, and the people of Australia, unfortunately, are going to bear the brunt of those false assumptions. No amount of rhetoric and no amount of spin&hyphen;doctoring is going to make a difference to that sad fact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The forecast that this government has given on unemployment is a disgrace. Jobs should be the priority. Job security is absolutely critical. Instead of talking about jobs and instead of talking about some of those facts to which I referred, most government members have announced with great fanfare the lower interest rates. I, like all people, am delighted to see the lower interest rates. They are a good thing for the economy. But what this government has lost sight of is that they are absolutely undermined by the loss of job security.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have already seen that in the interest rate cuts that have occurred. If you had an orthodox view, a traditional view, about this, you would say that interest rates have come down, that there would be more growth, that people would spend more money, that the building sector would grow, that we would see job confidence up, and that we would see the Yellow Pages Small Business Index and all these things high. They are not. You do not need to read those surveys to find out. You just need to spend a day going around your electorate, talking to a few people in business, to know how bad things are. I spent a little bit of time doing that recently, and all bar one person I spoke to in small business said that this was the worst they had had for years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was interesting that they said they did not like my former government. They did not like Paul Keating. They were glad to get rid of us. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> But a number of small businessmen said to me, `We were better off when Paul Keating was Prime Minister. We are worse off now than we have ever been.'

This fellow was actually genuine and he was puzzled because he agreed, and he said everyone he knew in the business community was going backwards and was doing it harder than they had ever done it before. He was not quite sure why he was getting people in the door&mdash;he was just glad they were coming. That is the legacy that the coalition has produced. It does not understand that, while it destroys job security, interest rates are not going to have an impact.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To someone who does not have a job, it really does not matter whether interest rates are 15 per cent or five per cent. They are not going to buy a new car. They are not going to extend the house. They are not going to build a new house. For someone who has got a job but has just seen a third of the work force&mdash;their workmates&mdash;lose their job through a restructure, redundancy or government downsizing, they do not have the job security to think, `Yes, I'll go out and take a loan and I'll buy a new car or I will go on a holiday.' The simple fact of life is that, without job security, interest rates are totally undermined, no matter what level they are at. People today have no job security because of what this government has done in the last budget where it deliberately set out to reduce gross domestic product. It achieved it, it did slow the economy down, it has increased the number of unemployed and it has set about laying people off in their tens of thousands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Against that background, interest rate cuts will not stimulate growth. It is a simple fact of human nature and it is one that appears to have been lost on this government. People will not take out a loan if they are not confi 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4215"> dent they will have a wage in 12 months time to pay the debt off, and this government has taken away from most Australians that security of employment. In the course of the last couple of months, we have seen announcements that go to 8,000 positions in Defence being abolished and another 13,000 positions in Defence under review&mdash;under the knife. We have seen another 20,000 Telstra jobs announced to go, as well as 4,000 department of employment jobs, in this budget. There is a supreme irony in that: while unemployment goes up, this government is sacking the very people in the department of employment who are there to help unemployed people to get jobs but 4,000 people out of the department of employment get the axe in this budget. And, of course, the government stands by and does nothing while the so&hyphen;called Big Australian decides to lay off 2,500 workers in Newcastle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To cap it all off, in a couple of months time you will close every CES office in this country&mdash;the very place where unemployed people have become accustomed to getting support, and you shut the doors! You have put out the `For sale' sign on the CES offices of Australia. What signal does that send to unemployed Australians? What hope, what opportunity, does that give them to get a job? Do not worry whether interest rates are five per cent or 10 per cent. The signal you send those people is that, firstly, you do not care and, secondly, you have no plan. Sadly, this budget reflects both.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Against that, there has been a bit of window&hyphen;dressing. There have been plans like Green Corps, which is an interesting scheme. I was particularly interested in it for a range of reasons, so I put a question on notice to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp). I asked about the number of people participating in Green Corps, and I got a reply on 13 May. In my state of Queensland, the total number of people participating in the Green Corps program is 40. In the entire state of Queensland, 40 people are participating in Green Corps and you herald Green Corps as a major initiative to help people who are unemployed.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real irony of this is that of those 40, 15 of them actually had a job before they went into Green Corps. So out of the 40, there were only 23 people in Queensland who were unemployed. So what has Green Corps done for unemployed people in Queensland? Twenty&hyphen;three unemployed people in Queensland have been picked up in Green Corps. And how many of those 23 were long&hyphen;term unemployed? Six. Six long&hyphen;term unemployed people in the entire state of Queensland are being helped by Green Corps. Isn't that a magnificent achievement! </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Government members have been putting out press releases all across Australia saying what a great initiative this is. The sad thing is that it is not just Queensland that is in this situation. Every state is the same. The total number of people in Green Corps in Australia is 240. The Labor Party's program of assisting unemployed people by way of environmental programs employed 13,000 people every year. Do you know how many you have got on Green Corps? Two hundred and forty. And do you know how many out of that 240, right across Australia, were long&hyphen;term unemployed? Forty&hyphen;two. You have helped 42 long&hyphen;term unemployed people. Members of the Liberal and National parties, in debates and in press releases around Queensland, have been saying what a great thing it is. Quite frankly, it makes me a little sick.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to comment on one of the planks that the government heralded with its budget: the savings plan. The savings plan means that, if you happen to have $60,000 in the bank, you can get a $450 tax deduction. When? In the year 1999. Just in time for you to buy your ticket to the Olympic Games, I imagine. But you have to have $60,000 in the bank.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know about members on the government side, but I do not have too many friends or constituents who have $60,000 in the bank. The average person who has $3,000 in the bank at five per cent will get about $22 a year&mdash;about 50c a week. That will make a big difference. That will improve the savings. But the important thing is that this has been done at the cost of superannuation. Ordinary working Australians have lost their best 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4216"> chance at retirement funding, which was the superannuation scheme. You have traded that in for this program. What is worse, it has a negative effect on national savings. This will not increase Australia's national savings pool, and the government knows it. The Treasurer knows it. He has evaded questions on it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What you are doing is transferring public savings to the private sector and you are doing it in a way which will probably be negative. Every review of these plans has come out with that assessment. You should be ashamed of the deception that you have endeavoured to place on the people of Australia in that measure. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe the federal government's 1997&hyphen;98 budget is a practical, commonsense plan. I heard the member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) say that there is no plan. But the plan is to create jobs. I will say something about that a bit later and comment on some of the things the member for Brisbane has said.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The budget is designed to help families who, heaven knows, after 13 years of Labor need some help. It is aimed at boosting small business, encouraging savings and repaying debt. The budget has been widely accepted and praised in all sections of the community. The reaction has been positive, which is not surprising given the government's economic strategies. With a forecast $1.6 billion surplus in next year's budget, this means a staggering $12 billion turnaround in the Australian economy we inherited from Labor in March 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Brisbane said that only Labor governments have produced surpluses in the past and that we were not fair dinkum in saying that we were left with a $10 billion deficit. I can assure the people of Australia that there was a $10 billion deficit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tragedy is that, if we had known the deficit was there, we would have done some initial planning and said a few words about it during the election campaign. But we were told there was no deficit, that everything was hunky&hyphen;dory and that the economy was well. We had suspicions that it was not. You cannot spend like Labor governments spend 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and not have a deficit. But $10 billion was absolutely staggering.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we were to use the same accounting system that Labor used, we would be in surplus right now. But we are honest in our forecasting and we believe that we will have a $1.6 billion surplus in the coming year. As I have said before, to turn around a $10 billion deficit to a $1.6 billion surplus in next year's budget is an incredible performance. It is great news for all Australians and for their future standard of living.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I stated, the reaction to the budget has been positive. This is supported by the strong ticks of approval given by experts in their appraisal. The Chief Executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry said, `This is a very strong budget which will go a long way towards restoring growth and lowering unemployment.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Managing Director of the Housing Industry Association said, `The federal budget addresses Australia's twin problems of jobs and low national saving.' The Real Estate Institute of Australia said, `The government's debt repayment schedule will help keep interest rates down.' Business writer Terry McCrann said, `The path to prosperity&mdash;Peter Costello has decisively buried the Keating legacy in more ways than one with a very good budget.' The National President of the Council on Ageing said, `We are particularly pleased about the initiatives for carers . . . we appreciate the initiatives to improve acute care in the public hospital system.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most ringing endorsement of the budget came last Friday when the Reserve Bank cut official interest rates by another 0.5 per cent, bringing the total fall in rates to a massive two per cent since July last year. The government has managed to reduce interest rates to the lowest level in 24 years&mdash;an achievement that was way beyond the economic capacity of the previous government. We can all recall the painful and destructive interest rates spiral of the early 1990s. There are still people in the community who have not got over that, who have lost their businesses, their farms, their homes and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Reserve Bank has recognised the government's sensible approach to economic 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4217"> management aimed at eliminating the budget deficit during its first term. Low underlying inflation, good long&hyphen;term growth prospects and a continuation of the government's strong fiscal consolidation strategy confirmed in the budget were reasons given by the Reserve Bank for its decision to opt for another cut in interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the coalition government came to power the people of Australia have won an average cut in their housing loans of a staggering $225 a month. As the Treasurer said yesterday, comparing interest rates at the height of the Keating government to interest rates today would mean a difference of about $800 on an average home payment. That is about an average fortnightly wage. That has been a remarkable turnaround.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition government's management of the economy and the creation of a strong economic environment will see benefits flow to rural and regional areas of Australia, including my electorate of Riverina. The coalition government has always believed that regional Australia, small business and family farms deserve a better deal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The budget contained a number of initiatives totalling $4 billion in future spending for regional areas, which will begin the long process of overcoming the damage of 13 years of Labor. Rural health has been a major priority in this budget, which contained a range of measures designed to improve access to health care support programs for Australians living in regional and rural areas&mdash;programs taken for granted by those living in the cities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's measures include: $17 million over four years to target major rural and remote health priority areas with emphasis on extending specialist medical training in rural areas; the creation of a rural and remote health support program to increase flexibility in addressing changing priorities; and $5 million for a one&hyphen;year pilot study to develop alternative funding arrangements for rural obstetric services aimed at improved access in identified rural and remote communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of towns in my electorate are experiencing difficulties attracting doctors to their communities&mdash;a crisis situation that has 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> been exacerbated over the last 13 years. In sharp contrast to our predecessors, the coalition government, through a wide range of policies announced in its last two budgets, is making a concerted effort to tackle the problem of a shortage of rural doctors&mdash;an effort that is being given due recognition and praise in those affected communities in my electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The battle was also won to protect Medicare offices in regional areas. Not one Medicare office outside the capital cities will close and the government has taken the initiative to improve access to Medicare services for country people by introducing electronic lodgment of Medicare claim forms direct from doctors' surgeries and the establishment of Medicare agencies in pharmacies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first round of those Medicare claim areas in pharmacies has been announced. I am hopeful that towns in my electorate like Leeton will soon be provided with that service. It takes up to 17 days for many people to obtain their Medicare rebate. I understand that part of the problem is a 10-day delay which was introduced by the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our primary industries have also benefited from the budget, which contained a number of initiatives such as the integrated rural policy package worth $198 million, $76 million for increased quarantine services, $44 million to reform AQIS's meat inspection program and $37 million for the national land and water audit. The $76 million for increased quarantine services is very important, given the recent outbreak of fire blight in Australia. It shows just how vigilant we have to be with plants, animals and produce&mdash;anything that is brought into Australia that can carry disease into our area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These measures are designed to improve the service provision of government programs which, under Labor, were of no real assistance to regional families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition government is committed to delivering a more efficient waterfront for Australian exports, and that means more jobs for our regions. Our high cost, inefficient waterfront costs jobs and millions of dollars in lost export opportunities for our regional 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4218"> industries. The government is determined to ensure that our waterfront becomes efficient and the proposed removal of cabotage could lead to reductions in freight rates of between 20 and 25 per cent or $120 million to $150 million on current figures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also good news for country people on the education front following strong lobbying by National Party members and senators on behalf of their constituents. In recognition of the fact that country people face additional costs in providing an education to those children who have to leave home to further their studies at a tertiary or TAFE level, the budget contains an increase in the dependant deduction used for the parental income test for Austudy from $3,700 to $7,400 for families where two or more students have been sent away from home to study.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our regions are also the big winners in the work for the dole scheme and the historic $1.25 billion investment in our natural heritage. That was an amount that was opposed by the opposition, but I believe this natural heritage program is one of the most exciting programs we have seen in Australia. Certainly in my area of the Riverina and the whole of the Murray-Darling Basin I believe great work will be done and it is certainly long overdue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The budget recognised the high levels of youth unemployment in regional areas and it is now expected that most of the 70 projects, comprising up to 10,000 places, will be located in non&hyphen;metropolitan regions. My electorate in the Riverina of New South Wales is one of the largest irrigation and horticultural productions regions in Australia. The MIA's history spans 80 years and the system is now suffering from stress as well as rising levels of salinity, silt and pollutants. The Murrumbidgee River and the MIA must be given priority in the government's national rivercare initiative and national landcare program, which are vital strategies aimed at sustainable agricultural production.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regional roads are also receiving a significant funding boost in the budget. In excess of $2.37 billion has been allocated for future roadworks Australia wide. In 1997-98, more than 90 per cent of direct Commonwealth 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> road funding will be spent in rural areas, creating a total of 19,000 jobs. I would like to thank the federal government for the allocation of funds for the Kidman Way which is a very important alternative route from Melbourne to Darwin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The lack of domestic capital is a major reason why many Australian companies go offshore to invest. Under Labor, there was no incentive to save. The coalition government, acutely aware of this problem, has taken action in the budget to reverse the situation and endeavour to return savings to their pre-Whitlam level in order to boost domestic investment and create jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As part of that strategy, from 1 July 1999 there will be a savings rebate on up to $3,000 of combined personal undeducted superannuation contributions and/or net income from a broad range of savings and investments, including shares. Savers will be eligible for up to $450 per annum and there will be a transitional rebate of up to $225 in 1998-99. The coalition government is the first Australian government in history to offer a tax break on savings to give Australians an incentive to save. The innovative savings policy will not only boost savings; it will boost domestic investment and ensure Australian small businesses, farmers and families have a large pool of domestic capital to use in their economic activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition's negative protestations on this issue have been shown for what they are&mdash;hollow rhetoric. The member for Brisbane, who spoke before me, also raised this matter. Claims that the savings bonus would only benefit the rich have been completely destroyed by the results of independent research undertaken by the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling at the University of Canberra on behalf of Bankers Trust. This research revealed that 79 per cent of savings income eligible for the rebate is earned by people with taxable incomes of less than $40,000. It also found that half of savings income within the scheme's cap of $3,000 was earned by people with taxable incomes of less than $20,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since winning government in 1996, the coalition has launched a wide range of initia 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4219"> tives aimed at boosting small business, and this program of assistance continued in the budget. Businesses with an annual tax withholding obligation of $25,000 or less under the PAYE and reportable payments systems will have the option to make payments quarterly rather than monthly. More than 300,000 small businesses, including those in my electorate, will be able to reduce their paperwork through this measure which builds on other reforms already put in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From July this year, small business proprietors will be able to gain relief from the capital gains tax when they dispose of their businesses to purchase a similar business, and up to $500,000 from the sale of the business will be exempt from the capital gains tax if that money is used to fund retirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now want to comment on a few of the statements made by the member for Brisbane. I must admit that I have not heard many previous speakers, but there is no doubt that, as you travel around the community, there is a great deal of uncertainty in the community. I must agree with the member for Brisbane in that I think it is related to job losses, and that is a tragedy. One of the main aims of the present federal government is to create jobs and to create job certainty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had a great deal of this uncertainty developing over the last 13 years, and even before that. Times change with automation, with computer systems and the need to improve technology if you want to survive in the real world. That does create uncertainty. I must admit that. It is this government's intention to try to overcome some of that uncertainty&mdash;to use the levers of fiscal and monetary policy to create a steady growth in the economy, not a boom and bust growth but a growth which people can rely on. We are hoping that, by the end of this year, that certainty will be there and that people will want to invest, will want to get on with the job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But you cannot change what has happened over the last 13 years in 12 months. While I know that members on the opposite side have been asking, `Where are the jobs? Where is the growth? Where is everything else?', you cannot forget the foreign debt that was im 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> posed on us by a previous government. You cannot change the fact that we had these tremendous interest rates which affected communities, and which still affect communities. You cannot have a system where you are creating all these phoney jobs and spending millions and million of dollars of taxpayers' money without any real relief and without any real jobs. You cannot change all that in five minutes. It is impossible for anyone to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are doing our best. I can guarantee the people of Australia that this government has the interests of the nation at heart. We want to create jobs. We want to give certainty to people. We want to be able to protect families. As I said at the start of my speech, our main aims are to create jobs, to help Australian families and to give a boost to small business, and that is very important. While we are talking about small business, we do not have control of the Senate. Many of those measures that we are trying to bring forward to assist small business are being held up in the Senate. We want to encourage savings, and we have taken steps to do that. As I said before, it is not only the wealthy that will gain from this; it is right across the board. Finally, and very importantly, we want to repay debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very proud of the achievements of the Treasurer and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in what they have done so far. We intend to keep on this path, a steady path, despite a lot of criticism. I am sure you will find that our record will compare more than favourably with the previous government's as we go about the task of creating jobs, looking after Australian families and creating an environment in Australia where there is security.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not only those things I spoke about earlier. Here in opposition we have people who were previously&mdash;and I just thought of this when I was speaking&mdash;all for tariff reduction. Now they have changed their tune. They do not believe in tariff reduction anymore. Then they were for privatisation. Now they do not believe in privatisation anymore. No wonder the people of Australia are uncertain. It is up to us in the parliament to create certainty in Australia. Through this budget, I am sure we are going to do that. We are 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4220"> certainly on the right path so that, when we come to next year, we will have a budget surplus and we will be able to do all these things that we want to do for the people of Australia.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the major shortcomings of the government's budget for 1996-97&mdash;that is, the current budget&mdash;was the total absence of initiatives that might have encouraged an increase in private savings. In this way, that budget mirrored successive budgets of the former Labor administration. Despite its election promise to the contrary and at the expense of domestic savings, the Howard government continued to shore up the Treasury's coffers in the 1996-97 financial year by increasing existing taxes and introducing new ones under the guise of levies, surcharges and user pays schemes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By contrast, this budget incorporates several measures which, for the first time in more than a decade, have the potential to attract meaningful levels of savings back into superannuation and other savings vehicles. Some have argued that the proposed 15 per cent tax rebate on savings is not the most effective means of boosting domestic savings. But the government deserves commendation for engineering a scheme that is generous and easy to administer; that has negligible compliance costs; and which will apply to all taxpayers, regardless of income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The broad based savings rebate rewards current savers and should promote a greater level of savings in the future. This measure at last gives something back to the people who voted the coalition into office at the last election but who got next to nothing from the new government in its first budget. It is true that the rebate on savings held in banks will mostly benefit higher income earners. But the application of the rebate to the first $3,000 in personal contributions to superannuation means that lower and middle income households will also gain from this initiative. The rebate will have the dual effect of reducing an individual's tax liability in the immediate term, while encouraging more Australians to become self-reliant in the longer term.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has suggested that this rebate could be used to help finance private health insurance, and so reverse the trend which is seeing a record number of Australians relying on the public health care system. Hypothetically, this makes good sense. But the reality is that the maximum $450 rebate is insufficient to cover the annual cost of most private health insurance premiums, or even recent increases in those premiums. In some cases, increases in the cost of private health insurance will still exceed the combined benefits of the savings rebate and the new private health insurance rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Twelve years ago, half of all Australians were covered by a private health insurance policy; today that figure has declined to, at best, one in three. Partly as a result, federal government spending on health care has increased by 20 per cent in five years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both the savings and health care rebates are welcomed. But they will not, of course, see any significant increase in the number of Australians reverting to the private health care system. So a problem for this and future governments remains.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite possible quibbles about some of the measures within it, this budget is a prudent one. It sees the continuation of a long awaited and much needed budgetary reform process that sets out to restore some balance to the nation's finances. Assuming that the figures provided by Treasury are indeed accurate, this budget will see the underlying budget deficit cut to $3.9 billion, or 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product&mdash;an improvement of some $3 billion on the current financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In contrast to the budgets of the early 1990s, which bore little or no relationship to Labor Party policy, this budget is consistent with the coalition's election commitments&mdash;although by no means comprehensively so. It is the second of a budget trilogy that the government hopes will establish an underlying surplus in 1998-99 somewhere in the vicinity of $1.6 billion, with a zero government borrowing requirement and no further tax increases. If successful, the government should be complimented by all for turning around a chronic budget imbalance in a very short period of time.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4221">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By way of further contrast, the Labor Party's approach to fiscal policy was a sham. It refused to acknowledge the need for a broadening of the tax base, and continued to lean hard on personal and business income tax for revenue. In its relentless pursuit of revenue, the previous government did not only introduce new taxation measures, such as the fringe benefits and capital gains taxes; it expanded the scope and rates of the wholesale sales tax as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More insidiously, the previous Labor regime brought forward the times by which existing taxes must be paid. Imputation of company dividends, payment of business income tax by quarterly instalments and quarterly instalments of provisional tax payments, and the prescribed payments system, are all cases in point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Simultaneously, Labor in government used fiscal policy to drive interest rates to historical highs. The effect of its raid on small business cash flows, by expanding the wholesale sales tax regime by new taxes and by the earlier collection of existing taxes, was to force business to either borrow or raise capital by either retaining profits or issuing paper.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apart from the more obvious effect that this had on the efficacy of business across the nation, it further emasculated our private sector savings. That might have been all right if the savings were merely transferred to the public sector, but the Labor government spent the takings like a drunken sailor. The two budget surpluses it did manage in 13 years were as much a product of earlier collections of business taxes as of increased and new taxes. Forced as they were to collectively raise tens of billions of dollars instead of  
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> relying on cash flow, SMEs were devastated by the high cost of money under Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And all for what? In the cases of taxes collected earlier than before, once&hyphen;off&mdash;at best twice&hyphen;off&mdash;benefit to the budget bottom line. Obviously the affected taxpayers did not pay more tax. What was paid earlier than usual could not be required later&mdash;hence the one&hyphen;off benefit to revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government, in the fullness of time and perhaps in the lead&hyphen;up to its next budget, might seriously think about giving the economic powerhouses that SMEs can be the chance to play a leading part in regenerating our national economy. It might reverse Labor's policy of earlier collection of taxes in too many cases payable before the SMEs had themselves been paid by their customers for the goods and services which gave rise to the specific tax obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To do so will not adversely affect the budget bottom line after the first year. It would, however, return much needed working capital to SMEs without changing current tax obligations. Furthermore, such a reversal would eliminate one of the effects of the present regime of early collection of taxes which all too often requires SMEs to lend money to the Commonwealth because the final wash&hyphen;up of a year's trading reveals refunds of taxes paid in advance are necessary.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the legacies of the former Labor administration was that Commonwealth general government net debts sat at around 19 per cent of gross domestic 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> product when the coalition took over the reins in 1996. If the coalition's fiscal program delivers the goods it expects, then this compo 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4223"> nent of debt will be reduced by almost half to 10.5 per cent of GDP in the year 2000&hyphen;01.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1997&hyphen;98 budget is premised on a more responsible fiscal platform, one that recognises that a reduction in the deficit must occur through the control of public expenditure and the encouragement of domestic savings, and not through increased taxes. But, while unemployment levels may be contained in the short term as a result of the government's decision not to increase the levels of income  tax, it is no substitute for a sensible and thorough reform of our taxation system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The decision to reward workers who defer their pensions for up to five years should impact positively on aggregate savings and in a small way improve our balance of payments score sheet. The maximum tax&hyphen;free lump sum of $21,251 for a single person and $35,450 for a couple is the equivalent of 47 per cent of the pension entitlement over a five&hyphen;year period. This initiative will cost the Australian taxpayer half of what it would cost to fund a full pension over the same period&mdash;a pretty substantial saving.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More than 80 per cent of people over retirement age currently rely on aged or service pensions as their principal source of income, and any easing of that funding burden should be welcomed. It will also mean an increase in compulsory personal superannuation contributions for each additional year of employment. Given that the participation of older men in the work force is undergoing a long&hyphen;term decline in Australia, the importance of initiatives such as this one should not be underplayed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the absence of policies which encourage an extended working life, future generations of taxpayers will have to sustain debilitating levels of pension support. Accordingly, the introduction of the tax&hyphen;free lump sum payment to those who postpone retirement should be applauded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the same way the coalition is right to introduce measures that will see the preservation of retirement savings for retirement purposes. The decision to preserve all superannuation contributions and savings until the increased preservation age of 60 by the year 2025 is an important one, despite the 28&hyphen;year 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> lead time. This initiative demonstrates an understanding that there needs to be greater integration between social security and retirement income policies to cope with the challenges presented by an ageing population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To those who argue that this initiative will encourage older Australians to remain active in the paid work force at the expense of employment for younger Australians, a recent publication from the Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Western Australia, the CCIWA, on the factors affecting youth employment give that supposition some perspective. The CCIWA makes it clear that conversations about youth unemployment figures are often based on misinformation. It shows that not only have the number and percentage of young people looking for full&hyphen;time work in 1996 decreased from 1981, but that 40 per cent of all 15&hyphen; to 19&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds who were unemployed in August 1996 were in full&hyphen;time education and looking for part&hyphen;time work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given that an individual can qualify for the new pension rebate by working for 25 hours each week, this initiative should see the creation of many part&hyphen;time positions sought after by these full&hyphen;time students. However, it is not contended that this initiative will solve our national unemployment problem&mdash;far from it. Nor, for that matter, will the work for the dole pilot scheme or the billion dollar Federation Fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only solution to the perennial curse of unemployment is to improve national savings, reduce the budget deficit and foster business growth and investment while keeping inflation in check. A reduction in unemployment will only come about through a commitment to a policy line which might involve short&hyphen;term pain but is necessary to produce longer term benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has indicated that it favours stronger economic growth to improve employment opportunities rather than policies specifically geared towards resolving the unemployment problem. There is a growth dividend in prospect, which promises to alleviate strain on the next and possibly ensuing budgets. It is banking on a strengthening of economic growth to 3.75 per cent in 1997-98 to maintain unemployment levels for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4224"> that year. The government's claimed commitment to industrial relations reform and to reducing the budget deficit indicates that it knows the right path on which to travel to secure a longer term turnaround in unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It may be that a growth rate of less than four per cent  will prevent unemployment levels from worsening, and it does seem unlikely that economic growth will do much more than preserve the status quo in the  foreseeable future. However, economic growth, combined with mainly conservative estimates in this budget, will open up opportunities to ease the pressure of high unemployment in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is questionable whether this budget will facilitate adequate levels of business investment to stimulate longer term employment opportunities. Admittedly, industry has escaped the savaging it copped last year from the departments  of Treasury and Finance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But while industry might breathe a sigh of relief that assistance programs have not been further slashed, there is little in this budget that will directly promote a greater level of business investment. Take, for example, the infrastructure borrowing scheme. While the scheme has been maintained by the government, at least for the 1997-98 financial year, its eligibility criteria are now so narrow that less than 10 per cent of the projects currently in the pipeline would now qualify for the tax concessions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a consensus amongst economists that a nation's rate of investment impacts directly on how quickly an economy can grow. There is clear evidence to suggest that declining levels in infrastructure investment over the last three decades have led to a decline in a sustainable rate of economic growth in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An injection of investment expenditure is necessary to help reverse unemployment and the decline in public sector savings that became a long&hyphen;term structural problem under Labor. Further, the government should encourage revenue earning, productive investment. The government's estimates show that it anticipates total business investment will 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> increase by eight per cent in the four quarters to June 1998. This figure represents less than half that experienced in the current year and may yet prove to be an unduly conservative estimate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The decision to simplify and rationalise withholding tax obligations for some small businesses is good policy. Small businesses that qualify for this relief will see the number of their transactions with the Australian Taxation Office reduced to a third of the present level. This in turn should see the reduction in compliance costs for a number of small businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government stated in Budget Paper No 2 that this measure represents `a significant first step towards simplifying the range of withholding tax systems imposed on small business.' This would warm the soul of any small business proprietor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition professes to believe that small to medium sized enterprises&mdash;SMEs&mdash;provide the engine to economic growth and employment. The government is arguably correct in that assumption. Although it has claimed that small business has benefited or will benefit under its governance, it is far from universally agreed. Polls of SMEs would indicate the opposite&mdash;that, indeed, the government has a long way to go before its deeds match its rhetoric.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Except when called on to defend the election undertaking to reduce the incidence of red tape affecting the operations of small businesses by 50 per cent, the coalition no longer makes any pretence of meeting that goal. It will, however, not embark on reform of the taxation system as required by this country.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have much pleasure in rising to support the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1997&hyphen;98. The fact that the Treasurer (Mr Costello) has been able to reduce in the one parliamentary term a deficit of $10.5 billion to a $1 billion&hyphen;plus surplus is something that I think that he should be very proud of. This is a very sound budget and, as I said, the Treasurer certainly needs to be congratulated and indeed is to be commended for continuing the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4225"> very difficult task of making this ship of state of ours seaworthy. We are now back on course.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Through this budget the coalition continues its commitment to helping families, boosting small business, creating jobs, and encouraging saving. Confidence and growth are the framework for the Treasurer's 1997&hyphen;98 budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition's second budget provides us with mechanisms by which we can build a future of opportunity for all Australians. It consolidates the coalition's strategy of fixing  the Commonwealth's finances and it provides choice and incentives. It does this without any increases in tax. With our policy of broad based structural reform of the economy, Australian businesses will be in position to enjoy economic growth and therefore create job opportunities for young Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition has continued its support for northern Australia. The Commonwealth's expected general revenue assistance to the Northern Territory for 1997&hyphen;98 will total $953.3 million. The 1997&hyphen;98 estimated general revenue assistance grant therefore represents an extra $28.2 million increase on the 1996&hyphen;97 general revenue assistance grant. This is an increase of three per cent on last year's grant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe all Territorians will gain confidence from the important, informed statements by the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey), in particular the statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Northern Territory's economy has grown faster than the average for all jurisdictions in recent years; with this growth reflected in own&hyphen;source revenue.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That refers to revenue raised and collected in the Territory. This growth position has been achieved in spite of the Territory's fiscal disabilities associated with its small and widely dispersed population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Throughout the financial year 1997&hyphen;98 we must hold fast to the fiscal balance position we achieved by last year's responsible, deficit correcting budget. From that position, together with the solid thrust of this budget, we have brought into focus that vital source of economic vitality and power&mdash;business competence. I believe that the budget policies of this 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government will lift the pace of economic growth in this country and create the job opportunities forecast by the Treasurer. You might well ask why I have such confidence. It is because I have close day to day contact with people in my electorate of the Northern Territory; it is because I am in touch with the wide range of business organisations operating in the territory; and it is because I know the mood of the people and of the business organisations in the territory. The economic growth of the territory is self&hyphen;evident to those with eyes to see and ears to hear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps I should suggest to Senator Bob Collins that he opens his eyes and clears his ears. By so doing, he might see and hear for himself that economic growth in the territory is truly on the way up. In real terms, job opportunities continue to abound in the Northern Territory because there is a consistency and compatibility between the policies of the federal coalition government, led by our Prime Minister, the Hon. John Howard, and the territory's Country&hyphen;Liberal Party government, led by the Chief Minister, the Hon. Shane Stone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to take the opportunity to provide honourable members with evidence of economic growth and job opportunities within the Northern Territory. Firstly, the Northern Territory's economy continues to grow at a fast rate and is expected to continue to go even higher. The Hon. Mike Reed, Treasurer of the Northern Territory, states that the economic growth rate will be sustained at around five per cent per annum over the next few years. I am proud to say that this rate of growth in the Northern Territory is a testament to the responsible government of the Country&hyphen;Liberal Party over the last 23 years. The sensible fiscal management of the territory has meant that the territory is now enjoying a rate of growth significantly higher than that of the national forecast of around 3.7 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am in no doubt that the territory's economic growth rate has been sustained by the flow&hyphen;on effect from the economic and fiscal policies of both the federal and the territory governments. In this context, and in terms of the territory government's specific budget 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4226"> policies, it is important to note that the private sector is a major contributor to the territory's economic growth. Private capital expenditure over the past few years has increased dramatically and is expected to continue to do so. As a consequence of business confidence, the territory's unemployment rate of 5.5 per cent is the lowest in Australia. This is more than three percentage points lower than the national average. It is evident to most of us that the private sector orientated policies do provide jobs. It follows that our policies have resulted in the territory's higher than average participation rate for its labour force. In particular,  employment growth has been, and continues to be, positively influenced by the continuing expansion in tourism and an impressive growth in the mining and transportation industries, plus sustained growth in the rural sector with particular emphasis on the live cattle export trade to South&hyphen;East Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From statements made recently by the Hon. Mike Reed, Treasurer of the Northern Territory, independent employment forecasts predict that Northern Territory employment will increase by 3.2 per cent during 1997&hyphen;98. Without question, the continuing movement of defence personnel and logistics in the territory will have a confidence&hyphen;building, beneficial flow&hyphen;on to the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition's budget, as tabled, provides a catalyst for yet further improvement in the level of employment. The budget provides about $143.1 million for defence, for major and medium capital works facilities in the territory. These capital works include: $80.3 million for continuing work on the first and second stages of the army presence in the north project; $14 million towards the development of Bradshaw Station as a northern exercise area for the defence forces; $14.5 million&mdash;$13.3 million for base developments, stages 3 and 4, and $1.2 million for a child&hyphen;care centre at RAAF Base Tindal; $13.3 million towards the post&hyphen;force review development, involving a variety of works at RAAF Base Darwin; $8.3 million towards the north Australia naval infrastructure, stage 1; $3.2 million for the construction of airmen's reaction facilities in Darwin; $3.1 million on project DEF 333 at Shoal Bay; $3.2 million for extensions to technical support surface finishing facilities at Tindal; and $3.1 million 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> for the construction of other defence facilities at Darwin and Tindal. These capital works projects will also impact on the territory's employment and overall economic growth position. Bearing these factors in mind, the forecast increase of 3.2 per cent in employment to which I referred previously is a realistic forecast.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Turning to the mining industry&mdash;the largest industry in the territory&mdash;this industry recorded an increase in value of production for the second consecutive year. Both mineral and energy production were up in 1996&hyphen;97, with the outlook for both sectors being very promising. Production for 1997&hyphen;98 is estimated at $1.8 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one issue on which I find myself differing with some honourable members: the lack of progress on the commencement of uranium mining at Jabiluka. Honourable members will recall that this government has discarded Labor's restrictive three&hyphen;mines policy. I suggest that the economy and job opportunities across the country as a whole would be improved by the commencement of operations at the Jabiluka mine. In this context, it is to be noted that gold mining operations in the territory are increasing in value of production, with new gold mines and major upgrades of existing mines planned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The recent agreement to go ahead with the massive Laminaria&hyphen;Corallina oilfield project has, without question, lifted the air of confidence surrounding the territory's energy industry. It is important to note that massive projects such as these will have a significant impact upon the overall national upturn in economic growth foreshadowed by the Treasurer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The return contribution, that is, the flow&hyphen;on benefit back to the Commonwealth by reason of the territory's economic growth contribution via mining, tourism, pastoral and other major industries, should not be underestimated. It is a two&hyphen;way affair. It is the private sector's capital investment and growth activities in Australia that are fundamental to the success of the budget now before the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other major capital works activity in the territory includes the federal government's road program. The upgrading of the Victoria 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4227"> Highway has resulted in a significant improvement to the infrastructure road system serving the territory's pastoral, horticultural and tourist industries. Following completion of the upgrading of the Victoria Highway attention will be directed to the Stuart and Barkly highways. The budget has allocated $53.02 million to the Northern Territory for road funding in 1997-98. That level of spending will create or sustain about 720 road construction jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Included in this funding for the territory is $24.86 million for maintenance and construction on the Stuart, Victoria and Barkly high ways and $560,000 on selected accident black spots in the Northern Territory. There is a further $18.9 million contribution by the Commonwealth to augment spending by the Northern Territory government on major roads and an $8.7 million allocation to local councils for spending on minor roads under their control.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Funding in these latter two categories is untied and to the extent to which it is spent on roads will be at the discretion of the territory or council. In 1998&hyphen;99, work is expected to start on replacing the Elizabeth River bridge south of Darwin. It is likely that the existing bridge will be replaced by a high level crossing which would improve the flood immunity of the Stuart Highway and therefore allow easy road access to Darwin in the event of a cyclone or other flooding emergency. This bridge is expected to cost in the vicinity of $2.5 million. The overall strengthening of the infrastructure capacity of the territory and the importance of these and other territory roadworks to our industries generally is reaffirmed by this budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now turn to the budget measures for securing the future of indigenous territorians. Of significant importance to the future of indigenous territorians is the government's undertaking that ATSIC funding would be guaranteed for four years. This guarantee will provide the ATSIC board with greater flexibility and greater financial security. There will be no funding cuts to the ATSIC budget and some extra funds will go to priority areas such as employment and business development. As well as maintaining the community development employment project&mdash;CDEP&mdash; 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">quarantine provisions, the government will provide funding for some 30,800 places with an allowance for natural growth of some 600 places. In addition, the government has provided $5 million which will go towards programs to reduce high indigenous incarceration rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has also set aside $1 million for a range of pilot projects to integrate young offenders into economic and community life. A review of Abstudy will make sure that funds are used more effectively with $122.5 million for 1997&hyphen;98 and a further $493.3 million to 2001 in continued Abstudy support. Some $216 million per year from ATSIC's budget must be spent on community housing and infrastructure projects. An additional $10 million per year over the next four years will go towards economic initiatives. I consider the 1997-98 budget affirms the government's willingness to improve conditions for indigenous Australians and to provide the necessary resources in the most effective and positive way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would now like to turn to the budget papers covering federal financial relations for 1997&hyphen;98. The Treasurer and the Minister for Finance commented in relation to budgetary and financial developments in the Northern Territory:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Northern Territory economy has grown faster than the average for all jurisdictions in recent years, with this growth reflected in own&hyphen;source revenue. Moreover, under the horizontal fiscal equalisation principles, the Northern Territory continues to receive a relatively large share of the pool of Commonwealth general revenue assistance.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Northern Territory's fiscal contribution to the Commonwealth in terms of the arrangements agreed to in 1996 and 1997 at the Premiers Conferences is $6.3 million. The overall position of the territory is that, with the support of the Commonwealth funding and growth reflected in own source revenue, the Northern Territory's economy is on the move. Earlier in my supporting comments on the Treasurer's 1997-98 budget I detailed a rate of expansion of industries in and around the territory. I commented on the significance of continued Commonwealth funding and also highlighted the importance of the infrastruc 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4228"> ture improvements now taking place in the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will conclude my supporting remarks on the Treasurer's 1997&hyphen;98 budget with a comment on the Federation Fund. It is with great leadership and vision that the Prime Minister has established the Federation Fund. Clearly, this $1 billion capital fund is designed to be focused on providing support for major infrastructure projects of national significance.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The railway has the financial support of the Northern Territory and the South Australian governments with each of them providing $100 million in capital grants. More than 2,000 jobs will be created in South Australia and the Northern Territory. Many more jobs will be created indirectly across Australia as a result of the opening of the southern states to trade in Asia. The Northern Territory Minister for the Railway, the honourable Barry Coulter MLA, has been kind enough to supply me with some figures which I believe reveal the significance of the project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The railway will use: 155,000 tonnes of steel rail and 3,500 tonnes of structural steel; 2.3 million sleepers form 170,000 tonnes of steel or 240,000 cubic metres of pre&hyphen;stressed concrete; 100,000 cubic metres of reinforced concrete; 15 kilometres of concrete culvert pipe; two million cubic metres of ballast; and 17 million cubic metres of earthworks. These 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> figures really speak volumes about the economic and trade benefits for Australia resulting from the railway.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Honourable members are well aware that the Northern Territory is Australia's trading door to Asia. There can be no doubt that the Darwin-Alice Springs railway is an infrastructure project of national significance.

This means a long-term benefit to the nation up to and surpassing the second centenary of federation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the second reading amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans). In doing so, I specifically want to focus on a couple of the issues raised in the second reading amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Principally, as the shadow minister for employment and training, I want to pay some attention to the all important issue of jobs because, as the second reading amendment suggests, it is the nation's most overwhelming current economic and social problem. In that context I also raises point three of the second reading amendment, which goes to the continuing assault on families. To my way of thinking the most important issue to families at the moment is not only getting a job but the all important issue of job security.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I would also like to raise at the outset the community's reaction to the budget. That goes to the concerns expressed by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and shadow Treasurer, Mr Evans, in point six of his second reading amendment, which basically suggests that even the government's best friends have described this budget as one lacking in shape, direction and vision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that context I would just briefly like to remind the House of the reaction by the head of the Business Council of Australia, Mr Stan 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4229"> Wallis, just over a week ago and also the reaction by the New South Wales Chamber of Manufactures in the form of Katie Leahy. They had some telling remarks concerning the budget, basically on the issue which is raised by Mr Evans in the second reading amendment; that is, the issue of jobs and the lack of direction and leadership that the budget gives on the jobs front.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On that note, can I say that I believe it is for that very reason that the Howard government has today got the wobblies&mdash;it is to a large extent because of the reaction by the Australian community to the budget. It lacks leadership. It has lost its balance and it is shaking. I know for a fact that that was the message given to the government, especially the backbench, when they returned to their electorates just over a week ago following the delivery of the budget by the Treasurer, Mr Costello.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is clear today that in the cities, the towns, the suburbs, and the rural and regional areas the community has quickly given up on this government. The budget has disappeared. It is not an issue of major discussion out in the pubs and the child-care centres and the schools and the streets of suburban and regional Australia today. That is because the budget was a dud. It snubbed the unemployed. It gave no hope to families on the issue of job security.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is for that very reason that the Australian community has given up on its national leader, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). He promised so much before the election but has delivered so little when it comes to the priority issues&mdash;the issues of jobs and job security. You yourself know that, Mr Deputy Speaker Reid, because of the broken promise in your own electorate of Bendigo with respect to the issue of job creation and the promise given by the Prime Minister to construct that all important art gallery&mdash;the big black hole in View Street, Bendigo. That was a promise forgotten soon after the recent federal election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is because, unfortunately, Australia today has a road show. It is a road show best described as the Mr Wishy-Washy and Mr Smug budget road show. Can I say that in the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> lead-up to the budget I think the Prime Minister and the Treasurer went out to create an expectation across the length and breadth of Australia that the government was going to do something on the jobs front, but the problem is that the one clear reason that the community has begun to turn its face against the government is its actual failure to deliver on the jobs front.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that is just plain wrong. I suggest that it is plain wrong because the Howard government came to power saying that jobs were the No. 1 priority. That was the No. 1 issue that it was going to work so hard to create. The government said to the Australian electorate that it was going to go out of its way to create jobs, jobs and more jobs and, in doing so, lock into Australia a sense of job security. The real problem is that, when you really examine the facts as to the performance of this government over the last 12 months, the government has spent more time destroying jobs than creating jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In an attempt to turn around the Australian community's negative response to this government's budget, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer spent much of the week leading up to the budget promising that the 1997 budget would be a jobs budget. They especially promised to do so much for jobs in regional Australia&mdash;regional seats such as the seat of Corangamite. That was the catchcry&mdash;be it in Bendigo, Ballarat, Townsville, Cairns, Broome, Launceston or Burnie.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real issue for this government was to face up to the fact that regional Australia was demanding a sense of security and that the key to creating that sense of security in Australia was to create jobs. They talked it up and up: go out and examine the regional newspapers in the week prior to the budget. There was story after story about the need for this government to give a helping hand to regional Australia, to actually do something through infrastructure development and government activities to create jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem for the government is that after that build&hyphen;up the Australian community was let down. What a big bang it was&mdash;all talk and no substance. When the Australian community actually went through the fine 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4230"> print of the budget, what it came out with was no real plan to do anything for jobs&mdash;nothing for jobs in 1997 and, more importantly, nothing for jobs in regional and suburban Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The Prime Minister and the Treasurer, I suggest, have made no attempt at all in this budget to devise a comprehensive job strategy. Instead, the 1997 budget followed the precedents of the 1996 budget. Unfortunately, not only does it not create jobs or create a sense of security on the jobs front in the Australian community but in actual fact this budget yet again abolishes jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I go to the issue of direct Australian government employment. By the end of the impact of the first two budgets of this government, we will see 28,000 Australian public  servants lose their jobs&mdash;16,500 of those public servants will disappear as a direct result of the impact of this budget. Australians are now starting to understand that those public servants are not employed in Canberra; they are actually employed in their local suburbs, in their towns and in their local regional centres. Those people were employed in such important work as providing essential services to Australians&mdash;the local Medicare office; the local CES office; the regional Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs branches; the local family law court in Tasmania; and the local branch of the Australian Taxation Office in Cairns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In centre after centre not only are government jobs going and families and communities suffering as a result of those government jobs going but, importantly for those local communities, essential services are also disappearing. That is a huge setback for those centres&mdash;a setback on the jobs front and a setback when it comes to access for all Australians, irrespective of where you live, irrespective of the nature of the job that you have or irrespective of whether you require a service to try to get one of those all&hyphen;important jobs. The services that actually facilitate access to those opportunities in life have disappeared as a result of government employment being slashed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For that reason, no wonder the Howard government has got the wobblies. No wonder 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> it has lost its balance in the last couple of weeks. No wonder it is shaking, as reflected in the most recent opinion polls. No wonder it is clear that in the cities, the towns, the suburbs, and the rural and regional areas the community has quickly given up on this government. The community has quickly given up on the lack of leadership over in the oval office where the Prime Minister resides. It is no wonder, and we all know it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What were we talking about very soon after the budget? Not questions of what the budget was going to do about jobs, not questions about what the budget was going to do to reintroduce services to regional Australia, not questions about what the budget was going to do to rebuild industry assistance to create jobs in the private sector. No, those issues disappeared within 48 hours of the delivery of the budget. What we then had to debate was a GST. A new smokescreen was created by the Prime Minister. Having faced up to the fact that, unfortunately, his budget was a dud and lost out there in the Australian community, he had to create a new issue for debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1997 budget has disappeared without trace because it is a dud. I will tell you why it is unfortunate that it has disappeared without trace: in the lead-up to the 1996 election, the then Leader of the Opposition made much of his comments about jobs, especially jobs for young people&mdash;those 92,000 15&hyphen; to 19&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds who are out there at the moment desperately looking for jobs. They are told on a day-to-day basis by their mums and dads, `You have to front up and try to get a job.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is what the Prime Minister had to say to those mums and dads and those young people in the lead-up to the last election. The Prime Minister had many opportunities to make comments along these lines, as he did on numerous occasions prior to the election, but I refer to an article headed `Career goal is youth jobs'. Mr Howard, the then Leader of the Opposition, bravely told the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> on 29 February 1996, only just before the federal election of last March:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have gone into this election campaign committing ourselves above all other things to doing something effective and doing something realistic to reduce the level of youth unemployment.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will be a very disappointed man if I have not made very serious inroads into the level of youth unemployment in this country because I would like to see our performance in that area as being the mark of what we have been able to do as a government.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What has been the result of those brave promises 12 months on? It was the Prime Minister who made youth employment a key issue in the last federal election. But in the end you have to be measured by your performance, what you actually achieve in life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note that, in the first year of the Howard government, youth unemployment has not decreased; in actual fact it has jumped&mdash;not by half a per cent but by two per cent, from 27.4 per cent to 29.4 per cent. It is not just the figures we look at. What does that mean in human terms? It effectively  means that, after one year of the Howard government, 91,600 young people are on the jobs queue. But that is just the young people. In actual fact, officially registered, there are 802,000 Australians of all ages who are now regarded as unemployed and 246,400 of them are classified as long-term unemployed. That is 40,000 more than at the time the Howard government slashed access to labour market programs in May of last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the Australian community is now realising that there is a huge problem not just among the young unemployed and the long-term unemployed but especially among middle aged Australians, middle aged men and women in the suburbs in places such as Sydney, Adelaide, Hobart, Ballarat, Bendigo, Geelong, Cairns, Burnie and Broome. The facts show that today, for example, that there are 146,000 unemployed 35&hyphen; to 54&hyphen;year&hyphen;old men. What does the Prime Minister say to them? `This is how I am going to create jobs: slash expenditure on labour market programs, sack public servants and do nothing to restore industry programs.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were big promises in the lead-up to this budget. The community expected a brave Prime Minister to create a brave vision of how the Howard government was going to do something to tackle our growing unemployment queues. But, unfortunately, nothing happened. The Australian community is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> coming to expect that as part and parcel of the activities of the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the growth front: we require a level of economic growth of four per cent to reduce unemployment in Australia. What is the forecast? It is 3.75 per cent. Last budget they suggested that the level of unemployment today would be 8.25 per cent. They then revised it to 8.5 per cent. What is it today? It is 8.7 per cent. Now they expect the Australian community to believe that in 12 months time it will be eight per cent. If you want to achieve a level of unemployment of eight per cent, then you have to be willing to intervene, to get your hands dirty and to actually do something to create investment opportunities and confidence in this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the real problem for this nation because to do that you require leadership&mdash;strong, committed leadership, not wishy&hyphen;washy leadership that runs from the hard decisions such as the problems confronting Newcastle and the automotive industry at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately for Australia, when it comes to leadership in the automotive industry it was not the Prime Minister of Australia who said that we had to freeze tariffs; it was the Prime Minister of Japan who had to come to Australia and lecture the Prime Minister of Australia and tell him that if we want to retain an automotive industry in Australia then we have to face up to the fact that the industry needs ongoing support in the form of a temporary freeze on tariffs. Again the Prime Minister went missing in action. The Prime Minister of Japan says, `Yes, protect jobs in Australia, protect the automotive industry,' and the Prime Minister of Australia goes missing in action yet again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we are going to make progress in Australia on the most difficult challenge confronting the nation at the moment&mdash;the issue of jobs and job security&mdash;we have to face up to the fact that it requires strong leadership, not wishy&hyphen;washy leadership. In that context, the detail of the budget offers no hope for the future of Australia on the jobs front&mdash;no hope whatsoever. What do they say is now the solution to unemployment in Australia? The solution is a mickey mouse program called `work for the dole'. Today they are threaten 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4232"> ing a double dissolution if they do not get work for the dole through the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today there are 802,000 Australians unemployed, 90,000 of whom are young people aged 15 to 19 years. So here is the panacea for creating jobs in Australia: work for the dole&mdash;$21 million over 12 months and some pilot projects for 10,000 places around Australia. There are 90,000 unemployed young people in Australia aged 15 to 19 years. There are 800,000 Australians unemployed, and we get 10,000 places in work for the dole for $21 million, of which $6 million is actually going to the administration of the scheme. It is not even going to create opportunities for young unemployed people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no mention of training&mdash;it is two days on, five days off. And they are threatening a double dissolution over work for the dole. What a joke. Australians want jobs,  mums and dads want their kids at work, but they want five days on and two days off, not two days on and five days off as work for the dole suggests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we go to expenditure on vocational education and training. You also have to look at that in the context of the recent changes in migration. The government is out there suggesting that it is concerned about unemployment at the moment and has based its migration intake on that issue. I go to the facts. This government has increased independent skilled migration by 50 per cent, which is untargeted and not matched with the skill and labour market requirements of this great nation. If that is not bad enough&mdash;and we have a major unemployment problem in Australia&mdash;what does this budget actually do about training Australians to take up those skills vacancies in the future? If there are skills vacancies, and the government is suggesting that it has to bring migrants from overseas to now fill those skills vacancies, then I would have thought that the government would have laid out a plan to train unemployed Australians to take up those jobs in the future and actually invested in the training of Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But go to the fine print of the budget and this is what it does. At the same time as the government is increasing independent skilled 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> migration it has slashed $269 million from vocational education and training programs and more than $2 billion from jobs programs aimed at getting Australians back to work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is time this government invested in getting Australians back to work.

That represents the first ever serious and sustainable attack on public debt by federal government, which has inherited a legacy of endemic overspending, endless deficits and rising debt. It also represents a historic watershed in the politics of fiscal responsibility. Perennial overspending with spiralling debts symbolise everything that is wrong with government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Government deficits, more than anything else, highlight a failure of the political process. For too long political expediency has dictated that interest groups be bought off with frequent grants, wasteful government programs and lavish taxpayer largess. Government spending has been perceived as a fail&hyphen;safe vehicle by which to placate special interest groups, reward loyal supporters and win the support of marginal groups through unfunded generosity&mdash;all ultimately aimed at winning votes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The political imperative of granting special favours leads inevitably to a logical conclusion: more spending, higher deficits and increased debt. To illustrate the point, we should consider the fact that in 1960 total federal government outlays were 17&half; per cent of Australia's GDP. By 1996, when the Howard government came to power, the federal government's spending had risen to 27 per cent of Australia's GDP.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For 34 of the 36 years between 1960 and 1996, real government spending grew, sometimes by as much as 15 per cent in a single year such as under the Whitlam government in 1974. Only twice in that period between 1960 and 1996 did the government of the day see fit to actually reduce its real outlays. Since 1974 the government has run surpluses only on four occasions. In the early 1970s, the federal government owed no debt. By the time that Paul Keating became Prime Minister in 1991, the Commonwealth debt was $33 billion. By the time Paul Keating left office in 1996, the public debt had trebled to around $100 billion.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Virtually every Western democracy has been beset by its share of fiscal excesses, caused in large measure by the underlying desire of politicians to curry favour via the pork barrel. In Newt Gingrich's book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">To Renew America</EMPHASIS>, he describes the situation in the United States in these terms:</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Stockman's efforts to reduce government spending in the United States in the early 1980s largely failed because the reality of the political process would not allow it. Politicians made demands, based on political expediency, to be satisfied by an ongoing stream of largesse from the public purse. As Stockman recalls:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The politicians mostly got what their constituents wanted, but here and there we trimmed the edges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">But my relentless deal&hyphen;making inherently yielded savings that amounted to rounding errors in a trillion dollar budget because it was based on bluff and searching out for obscure titbits of spending that could be excised without arousing massive political resistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thus for example, we did get the second tier cost of living adjustment in the railroad retirement program capped below the inflation rate. This reduced overall spending by 0.0001 per cent!</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In other words, there was no constituency for fiscal restraint, but there were political rewards for uncapped spending programs and generous government entitlements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the 1990s, we are beginning to see a stunning reversal of that political orthodoxy. For the first time in a generation, the political process is generating fiscal responsibility as voters demand austerity, accountability and restraint from their elected representatives. The debts accumulated by three decades of politics are now being addressed and reversed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1992, the Kennett government came to power in Victoria with a sweeping mandate for fiscal repair. It cut government spending, reduced the public sector and engaged in an ambitious privatisation program. The combined effect of these actions has been to halve Victoria's state debt, to run consistent sustainable budget surpluses and to move steadily towards restoring Victoria's AAA credit rating. More importantly, the Kennett government received an electoral dividend, being overwhelmingly re&hyphen;elected in 1996 with a renewed mandate for sound financial management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1994, Newt Gingrich and the Republican Party won control of the United States Congress, campaigning on the basis of their <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Contract with America</EMPHASIS>. That contract promised to put an end to overspending in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4235"> Washington, introducing a balanced budget amendment to the constitution, and providing the President with a line&hyphen;item veto of any new spending proposal.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The American people demand responsibility from Congress. The spending madness must stop.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our Contract with America begins with fiscal responsibility. Just as every American sits at the kitchen table and balances his or her budget, just as every small business must balance its budget, Congress must begin balancing our nation's Budget&mdash;now.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Earlier this month, President Clinton and Congressional Republicans announced a deal which will see the US government budget balanced by the year 2002. That deal will see reduced growth in the big&hyphen;spending areas like health and social security but will still cut income tax and capital gains tax by around $135 billion over the next five years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, the Howard government was elected on a mandate to attack an inherited legacy of deficit and debt without new taxes or tax increases. In fact, the government will balance the budget over a three&hyphen;year period at the same time as providing tax cuts to families, capital gains tax rollover relief to small businesses, incentives for private health insurance, and now a tax rebate for savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The incessant growth of the government sector has been checked. When the Howard government came to office, government spending was 27 per cent of GDP. By the year 2000, it will be less than 23 per cent. Governments, politicians and voters are demanding fiscal responsibility, less government and an end to the debt habit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian electorate is increasingly aware of the drawbacks of excessive public outlays. The problem with government overspending does not stop with the spiralling  debt it creates, although debt servicing is a problem in itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1997&hyphen;98, the federal government will pay $8.5 billion just in interest payments on the public debt. The debt burden of the past has become a major budget outlay&mdash;greater than the cost of Medicare payments or assistance to the unemployed. Also, as governments 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> borrow a greater slice of available funds, big private investment projects face scarcity of capital, higher interest rates and, ultimately, a need to borrow more funds from offshore.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those economies which are big savers effectively generate the capital for those who are poor savers, who increase their foreign indebtedness. Big spending by government also decreases the incentive for private individuals and households to save. The unchecked growth of government in Australia over three decades has seen personal responsibility eroded, giving way to a culture of dependency. Australians now know that if they fall sick the government will look after them and they have little need to privately insure themselves. If they lose their job, the government will come to their rescue, so no&hyphen;one needs to save for a potential future loss of income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When they get old the taxpayer will provide, so personal superannuation continues to be optional. If they have children, their child&hyphen;care, education and Austudy expenses will be subsidised, so the incentive to take personal financial responsibility for children is lessened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Every possible contingency&mdash;from illness to child-rearing to tertiary education&mdash;is covered by some form of government provided assistance. Is it any wonder, against that backdrop, that Australians are saving less? Meanwhile, the tax system which finances this public spending has traditionally been biased against saving.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Interest from savings and investment has effectively been taxed twice: once when the fortnightly income is actually earned by the PAYE taxpayer and again when that portion which is saved yields some interest income. Higher marginal tax rates on middle income earners exacerbate the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today, household savings in Australia are at an all&hyphen;time low. Having peaked around at 14 per cent of GDP in the 1970s, household savings have steadily fallen to around eight per cent of GDP today. Big government spending and ongoing deficits are symptomatic of the wider culture which no longer values 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4236"> frugality and thrift. Again, to quote Newt Gingrich of America:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there has been a general rule that each generation would live within its means. As a result, our children would not be stuck with the task of paying off somebody else's debt.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principle was that we would pay off the mortgage and leave the farm to our children. There was great delight in working hard and living within our means so that our children could be better off than we had been.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Only in the last generation has this bias toward the future been reversed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It has now become imperative for Australia to invigorate the savings and investment culture. This budget's moves to reverse the anti&hyphen;savings bias are a solid start. This budget provides a 15 per cent tax rebate for interest on savings and for personal superannuation contributions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Significantly, the government has also moved to provide `rollover relief' from capital gains tax for small business people who sell their businesses to reinvest or provide for their retirement. That move represents a sea change in the view towards capital gains tax. This is particularly true given the exemption from capital gains tax on the family home which provides a bias in favour of housing rather than more productive investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note with some interest that the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) recently mentioned in his address to the Sydney Institute his hope that the government would seriously look again at the capital gains tax and its appropriateness in a modern economy where capital is mobile and entrepreneurship and risk taking are vital to realising new investment opportunities. Will international investors see Australia as an attractive investment location if we are perceived to have a punitive capital tax regime?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unlocking Australia's future economic prosperity relies ultimately on fiscal responsibility by governments, a tax system which encourages saving and a culture which rewards investment and risk taking.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two strains of political philosophy within the coalition. We have just heard one from the Son of Newt&mdash;the member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur)&mdash;quoting Newt Gingrich from the United States. This is the economic libertarian strain within the coalition, which holds out the answer to insecurity as individualism: the idea that individuals alone can somehow manage to combat economic and social insecurity. The truth is that the widespread insecurity in our society can be met only through collective remedies&mdash;by people working together, by finding in the public sector an expression of their values and interests held in common. So the economic libertarian strain, whether in the United States or in Australia, has had its day. It is a failed political ideology from the 1980s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other strain within the coalition is the sort of conservative populism we get from the Prime Minister (Mr Howard)&mdash;very much the politics of nostalgia. But this, of course, is just Hansonism writ small. It is an appeal to an Australia long past; an Australia which was isolated in its economics, isolated in its engagement with the region and very much isolated in terms of its social values and inclusiveness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition is faced with the failure of these two strains&mdash;the economic libertarian 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4237"> strain, washed out from the 1980s, and conservative populism, typified by the Prime Minister harking back to an Australia long past, and we have no way back to the 1950s and 1960s. This leaves the Prime Minister as a strange beast indeed in Australian politics. He was only ever a reformer while in opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That, of course, reminds me of what Eddie Ward had to say about Bob Menzies: that Menzies' brilliant military career was cut short only by the outbreak of war. So, too, for the Prime Minister, because his brilliant career as a public policy reformer has been cut short only by the outbreak of electoral success and actually winning office. Where now are all the reforms and ideas he hoped to place on the agenda from the 1980s? He has backed away from his reputation in Australian politics as an active reformer with a cogent set of ideas and answers for the Australian people. His brilliant career as a policy reformer has been cut short yet again, by the outbreak of electoral success and actually holding office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was the way it was back in the 1970s and early 1980s in the Fraser government. All those reforms of economic internationalisation that were left to Labor and in particular Paul Keating in the 1980s were reforms that John Howard shied away from. It was left to Labor to bring Australia out of its slumber in the 1950s and 1960s. Again, we find in the 1990s the Prime Minister has no answers to the main challenges we now face as a nation&mdash;that is, the challenges of widespread economic insecurity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget is making Australians feel much less secure, particularly in the area of education. With Australia's education system still reeling from last year's budget, universities and TAFE have had to cop a double whammy of 1997&hyphen;98 cuts and bad policy changes. This year's budget confirms that the standing of the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs,  Amanda Vanstone, is as a minister against education rather than for it. While the vast majority of Australians see education as a sound investment in their future, Amanda 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Vanstone sees it as nothing more than a narrow exercise in cost saving.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why else would the minister in this budget abolish a further 4,700 undergraduate places through the higher education Commonwealth industry places scheme, which has allowed universities, particularly in the regions, to establish strong industry links and funding sources? Why else would the government be planning a further one per cent cut in university funding on top of the $400 million cut in the previous budget? Why else would the government cut a further $70 million from vocational education and training?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would maintain that Senator Vanstone has plainly misled the Australian public with her claim on 2 May that there would be `no more bad news' for the education sector in the 1997 budget. If this is her interpretation of no `bad news' then one can only wonder what sorts of cuts she would really like to inflict upon the Australian education sector. This is a government which cannot help itself when it comes to running down educational opportunities across the Australian population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Cuts to vocational education, university industry places, Language Australia and Abstudy, plus ongoing confusion about the proposed youth allowance, represent bad news for our public investment in Australia's education system. More cuts on top of the $100,000 up-front undergraduate fees, 21,000 fewer university places and large cuts to government schools funding represent the politics of stupidity. This is a government which fails to understand that Australia's future&mdash;its economic and social security&mdash;lies in fully resourcing our education services, not subjecting them to a double whammy of budget cuts and bad policy.</PARA>

They show is that all undergraduate  enrolments are up by three per cent, but those commencing in first year are up by just one 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> per cent. Enrolments in second, third and fourth year courses are taking place as a product of fear. The fear of students dropping out of university in 1997 and being affected by the changes to HECS has made them stay on in much greater numbers through the university changeover from years one to two, two to three and three to four than would normally be the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even that increase in commencing first year courses of one per cent reflects the fear struck throughout the university sector of these policy changes. Universities always over enrol as a matter of course. This year the university sector has over enrolled more vigorously than ever out of fear of the potential impact of the HECS changes turning students away and out of fear of future funding cuts most of which, the $400 million cut, impact in 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is in a state of denial and delusion by arguing that on these preliminary enrolment figures all is rosy in the university garden. The truth is that students are fearful of the changes. That is why the retention rate through years two to four at universities has been so high in 1997. They are so scared of dropping out for fear of then facing the Vanstone HECS system if they were to subsequently resume their university studies. The institutions are fearful of these changes. They are more vigorously over enrolling, compensating for Vanstonism, to the point where there has been a very small increase in first&hyphen;year enrolments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has made use of these figures, as has her junior, who is now in the chamber. Amanda Vanstone had this to say last week at the University of New England and also earlier in the month of May, `Higher education is thriving.' Try telling that to Roderick West, who she has appointed to investigate the university sector. He has been to every single Australian university to examine the impact of her cuts. He does not say that the university sector is thriving. He says that the university sector is essentially in crisis&mdash;losing courses, losing campuses, losing opportunities, losing students' places, losing academics. Right across the sector there has been a simple equation that this government needs 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4239"> to understand: further funding cuts equal a further decline in quality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the truth of the matter. There is no thriving of higher education in Australia. The sector has been turned into crisis. Of course, the worst is yet to come, because the accumulated impact of these cuts will not be felt most severely until 1998 and 1999. When asked about that by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper, this is what Roderick West had to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The question to ask is will the cuts continue down the years, because if they will, then universities will become increasingly privatised.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">After the failure of Fightback in 1993 to establish its credentials with the Australian people, we now have the Fightback policy by stealth&mdash;Fightback through the back door, these swingeing funding cuts which, according to Roderick West, will lead to the privatisation of the Australian university sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are the things that Dr Kemp has always wanted to see in higher education&mdash;the Americanisation of our system where it is simply a matter of market forces, economic libertarian ideology and a two&hyphen;tier system where there is one set of opportunities for those who can afford to pay their way into university and a very different set of opportunities for those not so fortunate. So Roderick West has let the cat out of the bag. The smelly cat that Dr Kemp set running in 1993 in Fightback is back out of the bag. We have now the appointee of the government in higher education predicting increasing privatisation of the sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Labor Party stands firm against those changes. The Australian Labor Party believes that a university education is one of the core functions of the public sector. This is a public good as well as a private good. Unless there is a huge public investment in the quality of education in our society, then it is inevitably underresourced. It is left as a privilege of the rich while those who are not so rich go without. The Australian Labor Party is in the business of funding up the university sector as a public good, of public merit, as we did in government and as we will do after the next election.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now turn to the question of applications for university enrolment. This is the key test of the impact of the government's policy changes. Any university really can fill its places by dropping standards&mdash;that certainly happened in 1997&mdash;and by aggressive marketing, which the universities, out of fear, have also had to engage in. But the true statistical test of the impact of the changes in university policy comes from the application figures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What have those figures shown for 1997? An 11 per cent drop in the minister's own state of South Australia; a 4.4 per cent drop in New South Wales and the ACT; a five per cent drop in Victoria; and a 3.5 per cent drop in Tasmania, impacting severely on that struggling regional economy. For mature aged students, there was a drop in university applications in 1997 of 10.6 per cent. So much for lifelong education. So much for people taking up a university opportunity because they hoped to re&hyphen;skill themselves, to find the education they need which establishes employability in the new economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are the telltale figures of the impact of the government's changes in university policy. The application figures show that Australian students, young and old, have been driven away from their aspiration to take on a university education. They have been driven away from their opportunity to educate and skill themselves to be effective citizens and effective participants in the new economy. That is to the lasting shame of this government. That is the true test of what is happening in the university sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that the minister is engaged in this state of denial and delusion. Amanda Vanstone arguing that less is more is almost Orwellian&mdash;that $800 million of cuts in education somehow produces more places. It is straight out of an Orwellian novel&mdash;less is more. It is doublespeak from Amanda Vanstone, supported by Dr Kemp.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The truth is that the university sector is in decline. We are losing quality. We are losing opportunities. We are losing our unique chance to educate the Australian people in a competitive global environment where education counts for so much and to build up the virtues of enlightenment and tolerance through higher 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4240"> education. This is to the lasting shame of the government. The Labor Party will be reversing many of these primitive changes in university policy straight after the next election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not only the fact that the government has a lack of direction in university policy and that it sees university funding as a narrow cost on the government budget instead of a sound investment; it is the fact that the policies are not only wrong but also backward looking without a philosophy of education or any clear public purpose for where universities in Australia should head. This reflects a broader problem for the government. It had a big intellectual investment in Fightback but then only a political strategy for trying to win government&mdash;not knowing how to govern according to a mandate for policy change given to it by the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the tasks for the Labor Party is to not only point out the policy failings of the government and its regressive impact on a university education but also build a positive alternative. We believe passionately that nothing matters more to the Australian nation than the education of its citizens. Learning and social progress have always gone together, and the power of reason and knowledge exposes people to virtues of rational thought and problem solving. But now, in the new economy, education is much more than a tool of social enlightenment; it is, with the changing nature of work and production, the dividing line between the economic winners and losers in our society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More than ever, economic value is being expressed through knowledge and the skilful use of information. As society continues to move from the industrial age to the information age, the role of government is in transition, most notably shedding its ownership of fixed industrial assets and investing ever more in the assets and capabilities of a learning society. The quality and equality of our society depend on the success of this transition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Effective equality relies on something more than society's distribution of income and wealth. It is the interaction of these primary goods with social liberty and the skills of  knowledge and learning which determine a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> person's overall freedom to achieve and pursue his or her wellbeing. This is the basic capability set which, if available to all citizens, gives a post-industrial society the qualities of enlightenment, effective freedom and equality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nothing matters more to this freedom to achieve than a quality education&mdash;the chance for citizens to uplift their skills and social capability. Hence, Labor's core goals for a learning society: giving each citizen a platform of enlightenment and learning on which to stand, recognising that security in the new economy requires a solid threshold of lifelong vocational skills and giving all citizens the freedom to achieve, according to their own ambitions and innate abilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given the importance of skills and personal capability in a post-industrial society, it is more important than ever to ensure education is discharged as a core function of the public sector. The great bulk of its resources must be funded in the collective rather than through user pays. As a community and a nation, we are all made stronger, especially in terms of economic growth and shared prosperity, by a universal threshold of quality education and social capability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor recognises that all citizens have an interest in the provision of an adequate level of funding for the education system, especially when cast in terms of mass education. The appropriate tool for vertical systems of equity remains a progressive taxation system. This is, after all, what Australians have always meant by `a fair go': contributing to the common pool of public resources, according to their capacity to pay, and drawing from the pool, especially in the enhancement of education, on the basis of need and merit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I share one thing in common with Senator Vanstone, it is that I too want the rich to pay&mdash;I want the rich to pay more&mdash;but through the progressive taxation system rather than with $100,000 up-front fees that the average Australian family cannot afford. That is the folly of a two-tier education system&mdash;a government that is willing to quarantine defence spending but make education its No. 1 target for fiscal consolidation. What sort of

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Having just listened to the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) deliver this appalling speech, I feel constrained to make a few comments on his continual misrepresentation of the facts and the highly distorted perspective he presented. I suppose that one of the remarkable features of the speech we have just heard from the member for Werriwa, the shadow minister for education and youth affairs, is its very great concentration, first of all, on university policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say, for a start, that the government is very proud of its policy for universities and the reforms that have been introduced. Of course, what the shadow minister completely failed to mention was that enrolments in the university system are up this year by some 12,000 students, and the total resourcing of the university system is up very substantially this year. In fact, the universities are estimated to have obtained in the course of the year an additional $250 million through their teaching services alone. So we have, under the government's policies, a more accessible system, with more students in the system and better resourced universities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As somebody who has come out of the university sector, no-one would be more aware than me of the way in which that sector was run down by the Dawkins policies; it was starved of resources. The amount spent per student fell throughout the Labor years, as the Labor Party squeezed the universities but refused to give them the freedom that they needed to provide places for those Australians who were prepared to invest in their education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was the Labor Party that believed `equity in higher education' meant shutting out something between 20,000 and 40,000 qualified Australian students every year, while allowing students from overseas to obtain places in Australian universities. It was the Labor Party's distorted sense of equity that believed in charging university students who were doing the less expensive courses with 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> lower income prospects at the end a much higher proportion of the cost of those courses in HECS charges than they were prepared to charge students going into courses with much higher income prospects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That strange concept of equity, of course, arises out of the peculiar ideology the Labor Party promotes that, somehow or other, you must not allow people the freedom to invest in their own future, that you must not allow institutions to do something according to their own mission, that they must be tied into a system of bureaucratic central regulation which only leads to the running down of and the reduction of access to the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is very proud that it has expanded access to university education and that it has produced better funded universities. I challenge the Labor Party to go to the next election with a policy of reducing the universities' flexibility to raise resources for themselves.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="LATHAM" NAMEID="K26">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What policy is this?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BT4">Dr KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I challenge the shadow minister to tell us where this additional money will come from. It will come from higher taxes, as he said. So once again we see the old Labor philosophy that it is better for people to give their money to the Labor Party and it will spend it on their behalf than to leave it in their own pockets and allow them to decide where they will spend that money.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the features, one of the greatest failures, of higher education policy under the Labor Party is that the number of people from low income backgrounds accessing universities remains at around about 15 per cent of the total. Of course, with the fixation on universities that we heard again today in the speech from the member for Werriwa, we see that old Dawkins message coming through again that if you are not going to university you are not going anywhere. The problem is that those going to universities out of school are only 30 per cent of the total students leaving year 12. What about the other 70 per cent of students? What about those young people in the member for Werriwa's own electorate who have chosen another course?</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4242">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that under the previous government the number of apprenticeships and traineeships, as a proportion of the work force, fell to the lowest level for three decades. We know that there was no effort whatever to make sure that young Australians gained the basic literacy and numeracy skills they needed to get jobs. We know that there was no effort made whatever to make sure that the schools were offering the appropriate vocational courses to the students who were not going on in the academic stream.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In other words, the Labor Party throughout its entire 13 years in office abandoned the great bulk of young Australians and, as we know, condemned so many of them to long&hyphen;term unemployment. So let us not have any of the cant and hypocrisy that we hear and the sorts of remarks that were made by the member for Werriwa as he tells us how much more the government is going to tax and spend on the universities, totally ignoring the fact that, by freeing up the system, the government has expanded places and resources for the university system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me direct attention to the educational and training interests of the 70 per cent of young Australians who are not going from school into university. In this government's vision, vocational education and training has an absolutely crucial role to play in making sure that young Australians get the skills that will get them jobs and that will enable Australian businesses to adapt flexibly and dynamically to the changes of the global economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our vision recognises the importance of a quality, accessible national training system&mdash;and, of course, many young Australians are now choosing to go into that training system rather than go to university. The member for Werriwa regrets that because he believes in the old Dawkins' saying that if you are not going to university you are not going anywhere. But the number of places in TAFE this year will be up by 55,000. Not only is the number of university places up but the number of places in TAFE is up by 55,000 this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are more and more opportunities for young Australians who want to pursue a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> different course on which to build their different careers. And this government is determined to make sure that those opportunities are available. Businesses, industries and regions need to take up the challenge to develop a highly skilled and flexible work force with greater adaptability to change and greater ability and readiness to pick up new technologies. That is what those higher skills and the government's greatly improved training system will give young Australians, because we believe in quality training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous government spent $500 million on short&hyphen;term training schemes that shuffled young people through one scheme after another for six months and had a four per cent success rate. That is $500 million down the drain. This government is putting resources into quality training, apprenticeships, traineeships and into vocational education in schools. It is making sure that young Australians are getting those basic literacy and numeracy skills that are fundamental to them getting a job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has embarked upon a major process of reform to vocational education and training to develop a new system that will generate confidence in business and individuals. We are establishing a training system which is responsive to the needs of industry and business enterprises, while operating within a national framework that ensures national standards and portability of qualifications are maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This system will be built on an ongoing partnership between the training system and industry, under industry leadership. Of course, that is another dramatic difference between this government and the former government, because the former government believed that, after all, training was in the hands of the suppliers and that businesses should not be allowed to choose who was going to offer the off&hyphen;the&hyphen;job training to their apprentices; they should be denied that choice. This government, under its training reforms, is opening up that choice. The former government believed that the more you multiplied paper and regulation on small business the better. It is no wonder they destroyed jobs. Under our arrangements and reforms, 12 different forms 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4243"> across the states and territories to take on an apprenticeship will be reduced to one form.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The centrepiece of the government's reforms to vocational education and training is, of course, the new apprenticeship system. The new national apprenticeship system is bringing the concept of quality training, as embodied in the traditional apprenticeship, into new industries in a new and flexible way. New apprenticeships are being developed to expand the number of training opportunities for businesses by moving traineeships and apprenticeships beyond traditional occupations into new industries to take advantage of growth and employment potential. This is going to provide increased opportunities for young people who are looking for a career without going on to university.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I informed the House on Monday, a historic agreement was reached last week in Adelaide between the Commonwealth and state ministers to introduce a new national system for apprenticeships and traineeships from 1 January next year. For the first time since Federation, Australia will have one national system of apprentices and trainees operating across all state and territory boundaries. Appropriation Bill (No. 1) includes funding to support the key elements of the new national apprenticeship system. This funding will underpin the development of a world&hyphen;class training system of which all Australians can be proud.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a continual campaign of misrepresentation by members of the opposition regarding the funding being committed by this government to vocational education and training. Spurious claims have been made in this House this week about so&hyphen;called reductions in funding and cuts in spending. Let me place a few facts on the record regarding the impact of the budget. These are facts that are already on the public record; they are in the portfolio budget statements. If the opposition had the truthfulness to look at these figures, and the integrity to quote the facts as they are, then they would not be misleading this House and the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fact No. 1: in 1995&hyphen;96 when the Labor Party was in government, Commonwealth 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> spending on vocational education and training totalled $1.2 billion. Fact No. 2: in this government's budgets for both 1996&hyphen;97 and 1997&hyphen;98, Commonwealth funding for vocational education and training totalled $1.4 billion. Claims by the opposition about funding cuts are simply untrue. These figures show that the government has increased spending on vocational education and training by $144 million, or almost 12 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been some reallocation of funds within this total package to target our highest priority, which is the reform of the vocational education and training system and the establishment of new apprenticeships. As I announced during the budget, the government is delivering on its promise to increase genuine job opportunities for young Australians. There will be $415 million available in 1997&hyphen;98 for the new national apprenticeship system. This will include $265 million for more than 100,000 new apprenticeships and traineeships in the coming year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a priority for this government to establish the new national system for apprenticeships and traineeships. We are establishing a flexible, non&hyphen;bureaucratic, less regulated system that is easy to access and responsive to the training needs of Australia's small and medium sized business enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will provide national qualifications that are built on the skills and competencies demanded by industry. This new national apprenticeship and traineeship system has been developed in close consultation with industry and will deliver the reforms that industry and employers are seeking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new national system will also deliver new opportunities for young Australians. Under Labor's policies, as I have already said, apprenticeship and traineeship numbers fell to the lowest proportion of the work force for decades. The apprenticeship in particular, the symbol of high quality employment based training, was totally neglected in the policies of the previous government. The decline in apprenticeship numbers during the recession years, induced by the economic mismanagement of the previous government, is one of the most disappointing facts, one of the greatest failures, of that government. In the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4244"> last 12 months, the government has introduced reforms that will reverse the decline in the apprenticeship system. Under the new national system the concept of quality training will be extended into new growth industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This financial year, I am very pleased to report, there has been a record number of traineeship commencements. At the beginning of this week, we had already achieved over 42,000 traineeship commencements, which is 6,000 more than the total for the previous year. The total number of apprenticeship commencements and recommencements for 1996&hyphen;97 will not be known for some time because of delays in the collection of data. At present, the numbers are tracking at a marginally lower rate than 1995&hyphen;96, but we still expect to have some 47,000 apprenticeship commencements or recommencements in 1996&hyphen;97. Overall, therefore, the number of apprenticeship and traineeship opportunities for young Australians has expanded dramatically under the policies of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the significant agreements that underpin the new national system include, firstly, simplified regulatory arrangements which massively cut the red tape and workload for employers. This includes significant rationalisation of the paperwork involved in taking on trainees and apprentices. As I have mentioned, previously employers were required to complete up to 12 forms to take on apprentices and trainees. In the new national system they will have only one form to fill in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, there will be national recognition of training providers and qualifications, meaning that young people who undertake training in one state or territory will have that training recognised wherever they work in Australia. This new arrangement, of course, will therefore greatly expand career opportunities for young people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, there will be new funding arrangements for off-the&hyphen;job training for apprenticeships and traineeships, allowing employers and their trainees to choose which provider will deliver their training. For the first time, we will have a demand driven training system, giving employers an unprecedented opportunity to select the training that meets the needs of their business. More than $500 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> million a year in federal and state funding will be available for competition by public and private training providers under this system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Within Appropriation Bill (No. 1), over $265 million has been set aside to support the government's new employer incentives regime. As I have mentioned, this will fund over 100,000 new apprenticeships, including in the high growth industries such as technology, finance, tourism and the traditional trades&mdash;providing more opportunities for young Australians seeking a quality career based on industry recognised skills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new incentives regime will target Commonwealth employer incentives more tightly on quality outcomes and will provide greater incentives to employers to take on out-of-trade apprentices and trainees to ensure that they  complete their training and gain a qualification that leads to  real jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new regime also removes anomalies between the tax treatment of employer incentive payments for apprentices and trainees through the conversion of the tax rebate on apprentice incentives to outlays. This conversion, which is consistent with the National Commission of Audit report, will simplify payment arrangements, improve the transparency of payments and allow better accountability of Commonwealth financial assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An amount of $24 million has been set aside to develop a new national network of one&hyphen;stop apprenticeship shops as part of the new employment services market. These one&hyphen;stop shops will provide streamlined Commonwealth and state services to employers wishing to take on apprentices and trainees. With a single phone call or visit, employers will be able to access the complete range of Commonwealth and state recruitment, administration and payment services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These one&hyphen;stop shops herald a new era of cooperation between Commonwealth and state levels of government. They will remove duplication and overlap, and allow employers to access the training system through a single point of contact. Services will be delivered in a more timely and efficient manner, making employment based training through appren 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4245"> ticeships and traineeships a far more attractive option for employers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) also includes funding to support the expansion of group training arrangements. This funding will be targeted at servicing the apprenticeship and traineeship needs of small businesses, who often find it difficult to make a full&hyphen;time commitment to engage an apprentice or a trainee. Group training arrangements will help small and medium sized businesses access quality training offered through apprenticeships and traineeships. This training will deliver a highly skilled work force that can improve their productivity and help businesses gain a competitive edge in the global economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new national system will also provide increased opportunities for young people. The government is committed to providing quality training opportunities to all young Australians, including those who are disadvantaged in the labour market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) includes funding of $20.5 million for the access program, which provides preliminary training to disadvantaged young people to help them successfully participate in an apprenticeship or a traineeship. Funding under the access program will provide assistance to around 6,000 people through programs which can demonstrate direct linkages into apprenticeships or traineeships upon the completion of training. One of the reasons we need an access program is that many young people are simply not equipped with the skills they need to enter the labour market. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Immigration must be halted in the short term so that our dole queues are not added to by, in many cases, unskilled migrants not fluent in the English language.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The member for Oxley is peddling a view to Australians who are hurting under massive increases in unemployment. This view is that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> they cannot get a job because immigrants are taking them. The truth about unemployment is that immigration, on the scale undertaken in Australia, has a neutral impact on unemployment. However, there are 30,000 more unemployed people in Australia since the Liberals came to government. The Liberal government will not admit that it has failed them&mdash;it boasts that it has kept their faith. The member for Oxley is providing false answers to the questions the Liberal government refuses to respond to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) last year acknowledged research results which consistently prove that immigration has a neutral effect on a number of key aspects for economic life, including real wages and inflation, living standards and the balance of payments. This argument was based on the assumption that the balance of immigration under Labor was wrong, that it was too focused on allowing Australian residents to marry people from overseas and to have their families join them in Australia. This argument ignores the documented evidence that family ties are important for the establishment of a strong and cohesive nation and the successful settlement of newly arrived immigrants in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Liberal government believes that skilled migrants are more important for Australia because they have lower unemployment rates than family reunion migrants. The government cannot have it both ways, however. It cannot tell us&mdash;to justify a reduction in programs&mdash;that migrants take jobs and then change the intake quota to improve the capacity of migrants to get jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is worse, this argument places the priority on fundamentally flawed concepts of an economic rationalist migration program which has been proven to be wrong over the last year. If the so&hyphen;called balance that the government has achieved in giving priority to migrants who are skilled is the correct balance, why is it that unemployment is still at 8.75 per cent? The answer, clearly, is that migration has, at worst, a neutral impact on jobs. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Liberal government has recanted on its original statements on immigration and has now cut the program, after telling us last year that its program was a better balance which would reduce unemployment in Australia without reducing the number of migrants who arrive in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current immigration cuts proposed by the government in its 1997&hyphen;98 immigration program represent only 0.03 per cent&mdash;or one&hyphen;third of one per cent&mdash;of Australia's population. Is such a small cut really worth all of the angst, division and racism which has been beaten up in this country by the anti&hyphen;immigrant campaigners?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government does not really even believe its own propaganda, in my view. If it did, why would it adjust its figures by statistical manipulation, counting concessional family entrants as skilled migrants? The truth is that the government knows that immigration does not create unemployment. Its stance on this issue is patently an attempt to convince people who are hurting that it is not the government's fault. The government's approach shifts blame away from itself onto migrants who come to Australia to start a new life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs also noted that the demand migrants create for goods and services when they arrive in Australia creates at least as many jobs as they occupy. When the government denies migrants access to social security benefits for two years after they arrive in Australia, they are creating a pool of essentially slave labour that will have to work for a pittance under the industrial contract system. Migrant outworkers are a clear example of migrants having to find any work that is available, even at severe risk to their health and safety. The two&hyphen;year waiting period entrenches a society where migrants are seen as a second&hyphen;class labour force. The member for Oxley says she is about equality but really, in my view, she is about cutting support for the most disadvantaged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has created a myth that the two&hyphen;year waiting period was merely an extension of time&mdash;four times longer than the waiting period introduced by Labor in fact. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> The Liberals argue that they have maintained the exemptions to the waiting period which the Labor government established when it was in office. This is blatantly untrue. Spouse migrants make up nearly 40 per cent under the 1997&hyphen;98 migration program. Under Labor, this group of migrants were never required to serve a waiting period before they could access social security benefits, because the Labor government recognised that Australians should be allowed to choose who they marry and that they should not be punished for marrying people from overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) has said what we all know to be true&mdash;that the member for Oxley's anti-immigration agenda is more accurately described as an anti&hyphen;Asian immigration agenda. The member for Oxley suggests that Australia is subject to an invasion by people in the Asian region, claiming that, by the year 2040, some 53.6 per cent of our population will be Asian. The actual projections, based on current migration and growth patterns over the next 30 years, show that the Asian&hyphen;born population of Australia will be around 7.5 per cent&mdash;nowhere near 53.6 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Oxley has been telling Australia that she is running the government's immigration program. And who could really reasonably disagree? We have a Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs who, under the Liberal government, was removed from cabinet&mdash;the government's key decision making body&mdash;and it appears that the member for Oxley's incoherent and discredited statements are now guiding policy on multicultural affairs and the immigration program in this country. What sort of new life can migrants make for themselves in the current environment? The race debate in Australia is damaging the very social fabric of our society. It rips away social cohesion and reflects the petty prejudice of those who feel that society owes them more than those who are systematically disadvantaged by racism and discrimination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Racism is hurting the nation in the region and around the world. Australia has worked very hard for more than 20 years to dispel the old views of Australia on the international 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4247"> stage as being a nation of racist idiots. It was the Whitlam government, the Whitlam Labor government, which repealed the White Australia policy, and successive governments, until now, have delivered a multicultural policy to prove to the rest of the world that we are not a bunch of racist idiots. All of this good work, in my view, has been undone in the last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This debate means that people in Australia&mdash;neighbours&mdash;now view each other with suspicion and blame. Good people, people who are working, who are friendly and who want to work with each other, are being told that the people with whom they are working and living next to are the cause of all their problems. They are told that migrants and Aboriginals are being given `special treatment' by the government. If the government pays one cent towards assisting Aboriginals to recover from 200 years of discrimination and oppression, they are told it is `special treatment'. If the government recognises the value of migrants' contribution and seeks to enhance that contribution by providing them with language, training or job assistance, they are told that it is `special treatment'. If the government gives Aboriginals title to the land they already legally own, they are told it is `special treatment'. What they are being told by this government is wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will talk for a moment about the concept of equity of outcomes. There are no Australians in my view&mdash;or at least very few&mdash;who would like to see their fellow Australians victim to racist abuse or discrimination or starving in the streets. Yet Pauline Hanson and some of the pollsters in this country do not talk about racism in these terms. They pose questions which assume that migrants, Aboriginals and other disadvantaged groups in this country are getting special consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are people in Australia who wrongly believe that the government gives all migrants a new car and a mobile phone when they come into Australia. The only migrants who ever got a direct benefit from the government from migrating to Australia were the Poms who migrated to Australia under assisted package schemes&mdash;the so&hyphen;called &pound;10 immi 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> grants. This was an era when Australian governments knew the value of migrants and made contributions to their effective settlement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that discrimination and racism do exist in Australia. They require targeted inputs to deliver equal outcomes. Contrary to the current Liberal approach, targeted inputs do not mean cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Migrants have had a deep and positive effect on the social and economic development of Australia. The Snowy Mountains hydro&hyphen;electric scheme, for example, relied substantially on migrant labour. Throughout our history migrants have contributed vital new skills and training opportunities to the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other nations are not deaf to the racism which is currently being articulated in Australia. How is this debate hurting Australian interests in countries our business people have fought long and hard to gain entry into? How do workers feel when they are denied jobs because their companies are denied contracts because we are considered in the region as a pack of racists? The government have done very little in my view to counter what is essentially a very large problem that is growing in the region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many people have complained about the lack of response from the government to the comments expressed by Pauline Hanson. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard), who discounts every argument he disagrees with as political correctness, has consistently defended the right of Pauline Hanson to express her views when he has been asked to explain the government's silence on the issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget has broken the government's silence on racism. This budget outlines in simple dollar and cents terms what stance the government has taken on racism. This budget has put the government's money where its mouth is. But it is a mean and stingy response; an impoverished response to the racism and discrimination faced by migrants, Aboriginals and other disadvantaged groups. There are several key areas in the budget which speak volumes about the Liberal government, how they really view the emerging racism in Australia in their cuts to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4248"> Aboriginal affairs, cuts to education, cuts to multicultural affairs, cuts to Attorneys-General and cuts to health.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In National Reconciliation Week, it is vital that we scrutinise the budget to look for ways to ensure that past mistakes in this nation are not repeated. Many of the criticisms of the past revolve around the way in which Aboriginals were denied the right to self&hyphen;determination. This budget quarantines spending in a vast part of ATSIC's overall budget, including crucial employment and housing related programs, denying ATSIC, as the representative body of Aboriginal people and hence all Aboriginals, the right to appropriately allocate resources to resolve the problems which most affect them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been estimated that, without a serious effort on the part of both the government and the private sector, and without the injection of funds to make this effort possible, unemployment amongst indigenous Australia will reach 47 per cent by the year 2006&mdash;more than five times the current national unemployment rate. The government must listen to the Aboriginal community and provide that community with adequate funding and flexibility to most effectively combat this disastrous prediction for the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Appropriate funding for education and training is vital to ensure that indigenous Australians are able to compete effectively on the job market, particularly in the face of the discrimination they suffer. In the area of Aboriginal education and training, we see massive cuts to Abstudy and other education programs for indigenous Australians. Where is the government's commitment to ensuring that unemployment problems faced by this generation and past generations of indigenous people are not repeated in the next generation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Aboriginal health is another area of intense need. The Australian Medical Association has criticised this Liberal government's budget for its `steady as she goes' approach to dealing with major health problems confronting indigenous people, calling for an injection of funds into this fundamental area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The status of health in the Aboriginal community is appalling in a modern country 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> like Australia. Recently the Prime Minister and the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) have reflected upon this and have conceded that the real issue is how much resources are committed by the government. We like hearing the words, but what counts is the dollars that arrive at the end of the day. Comprehensive programs are desperately required to improve the health outcomes for indigenous Australians, not the half&hyphen;hearted attempt that the current budget offers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to turn briefly to part of my own electorate. The government is beginning to move some of its focus onto health and education for Aboriginal people. However, the Prime Minister is still talking about models of dependency rather than empowerment. The only effective model for real community development is the model that empowers Aboriginal people, and the model that Aboriginal people have adopted themselves has been that of land rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Booderee, formerly known as Jervis Bay, in my electorate is an excellent example of how an Aboriginal community has begun to be empowered by the partial realisation of their land right claims under the former Labor government, how they can work to effectively develop themselves. The model used by the community in Booderee has established a community which is beginning to regenerate itself. Houses are being constructed to replace the tin sheds which had no access to sewerage, water or power and that have been there since the thirties and the forties in some cases. This process is not complete, but it has been embarked upon. The community still needs help, but the recognition of land rights has increased the dignity and the capacity of the community to regenerate itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, this is a superior model than waiting for an ever diminishing socialised wealth which has been progressively cut by the current government. The empowerment model is a model which has been embraced by the Aboriginal community at Booderee. It depends on the land rights that they have been able to assert over the area. Land rights are a feasible vehicle for empowerment over dependency, which is why the Labor Party 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4249"> supports the recognition of native title. Booderee shows there is a better way to manage cultural diversity in the racist debate that is going on at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The budget goes against all of the values espoused by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. In his article, the minister recently debunked some of the myths that have been generated about migrants and their contribution to this country. He highlighted the damage that prejudice and racism have had in our society. Why then is he defending a 40 per cent cut to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission? What has changed in seven months?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These cuts have targeted the legal processes of the commission&mdash;the protection the commission provides to people who are victims of racial vilification and racial discrimination. The minister criticised recent racist statements as, at best, misconceived or ill&hyphen;informed and, at worst, damaging to Australia's interests. Language training is one of the greatest tools for engendering a sense of cross-cultural understanding. Why then does this budget abandon control of the Asian language studies program for schools to the states? Why does it refuse to support basic principles of productive diversity?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last budget, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs announced a $5 million anti-racism campaign and promised to review progress and consider further action in this year's budget to `build up on the momentum created in the 1996-97 budget'. Those were his words. Not only has there been no momentum to `build up on'; there has been no campaign, no extra money to get the campaign up and running this year, and half a million of the original $5 million essentially was lost by a sleight of hand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That campaign is essential, particularly at the moment, to ensure that all of Australia appreciates the commitment and contribution that the entire society makes. The government should be spending more money in my view&mdash;or should at least be spending the money it has set aside&mdash;on anti&hyphen;racism education. It needs to encourage Australians to engage in a multicultural society by learning 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> about the cultures and languages of our nearest neighbours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is widespread agreement that Australia must meet its international obligations to humanitarian entrants and refugees. Why then has the government cut funding for survivors of torture and trauma by 30 per cent? Some refugees arrive in Australia without a refugee visa. They are forced to undertake a lengthy process to prove their claims for refugee status. Why has the government cut nearly $3 million from the asylum seeker assistance scheme and foreshadowed a further cut of $6 million in forward estimates? Is the government's widely discredited economic rationalist agenda more important than our undertakings under international law, national law and common human decency?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the same way that human development self&hyphen;empowerment models have contributed to a small but growing independence of the Aboriginal community in my electorate, these models can and should be used&mdash;and have been in the past&mdash;to assist migrants in settlement. The Liberal government came to power last year with a commitment to a settlement program which would flourish with further grants to community workers who assist migrants to make the transition to a new life in this country. The commitment was backed up by a promise to provide $20 million directly to the community over four years. Why then has this government ripped $1.4 million out of the community sector which provides settlement services directly to migrants? This equals approximately 40 community workers. That is 40 communities which will not have access to the same rights as others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my view, the Liberal government has taken away any effective strategy for dealing with racism in Australia by cutting the services which exist to protect and promote a united and culturally diverse Australia for all Australians. The Liberal government has betrayed Australians with its budget cuts to this strategy which would eliminate racism. Like many of the cuts this government has introduced across the board, the cuts are not planned in any logical manner to support the rhetoric it mouths as policy.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4250">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only consistency in their response to the member for Oxley has been their failure to deliver any of the unity, any of the harmony or any of the respect and racial tolerance they talk about. The failure to rule out a cross&hyphen;party campaign of putting Pauline Hanson last at the next federal election shows that even when the Liberals disendorse a candidate the ties are still there. They can be seen from this budget. The member for Oxley is leading the Liberal government down a slippery slope which will destroy our future and multiculturalism. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 20 August last year the coalition government handed down its first budget in 13 years and set out with determination and commitment to chart Australia's return to responsible economic management. At the time it was described as the `fair go' budget. On 13 May this year the Treasurer (Mr Costello) handed down the second budget of the coalition government and in doing so handed down a budget which will continue the coalition's course as planned and will put the Australian economy into surplus in our very first term of office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a savings budget, not only in the sense that it is saving our economy but in the sense that it is saving our future as well. When we were elected to government on 3 March 1996, one of the most serious concerns on the minds of many people in my electorate of Hughes was the enormity of the budget deficit and the worry of how we would pay it off. After 13 years of aimless economic drift the previous Labor government left all Australians a losing legacy&mdash;an historic deficit of $10.3 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Through its commitment to responsible economic planning, this government is heralding strong economic growth through its plan of low debt, low interest rates and low inflation. Around 200,000 new jobs are forecast to be created over the coming year. This budget heralds decades of long and sustained growth which will take us into the 21st century, based on its program of fiscal consolidation which will be achieved on the expenditure side of the budget. This budget also heralds its delivery of promises by its strong commit 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment to families, to boosting small business, to creating jobs and to encouraging saving. No more will the Australian economy labour under Labor's high debt, Labor's high interest rates, Labor's high inflation and Labor's high unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government's economic leadership has focused on monetary policy as a key element of macro&hyphen;economic reform, on fiscal consolidation through realising over $12 billion on its first three years and on wages through industrial relations reform and enterprise agreements. This kind of leadership has outcomes which put people first. Yet the Labor Party has fought hard on all fronts, and had it succeeded in winning any one of them Australian families would not now be enjoying the low interest rates and low mortgage rates that are currently in effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that our Australian economy now holds such promise to work for the benefit of all Australian society is the brightest of all promises delivered by the coalition government&mdash;and no thanks to Labor. Such measures are of vital importance to the people of my electorate of Hughes which covers a large area of southern Sydney and comprises large residential suburbs, neighbourhood shopping centres and areas of light industrial activity. Such measures have been warmly welcomed by my constituents who understand the necessity of encouraging national savings and so reduce our reliance on foreign debt. They understand the need to finance more of our own investment to make our economy strong and to produce more jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the measure of this coalition government that the losing legacy of the Labor years will be turned around in only one coalition term. Clearly this is an economic achievement of the greatest significance for all Australians. It means that after only three years of responsible economic decisions the Australian nation will boast a budget surplus of $1.6 billion. This is such a great achievement that it deserves repeating and it deserves to be trumpeted from this House into all the houses of the nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This coalition government will turn the national budget deficit of $10.3 billion into a $1.6 billion budget surplus in three short 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4251"> years. This is a phenomenal achievement by any standard, so let the trumpets play and let them sound the reveille for the Australian economy, for the reduction in official rates, now down to 5.5 per cent, and for current low inflation rates that are at a level unheard of since the pre&hyphen;Whitlam era. The program is now in place for long and sustainable economic growth with none of the boom and bust of the previous Labor years. In this financial year alone the coalition government will pay back $5 billion of Labor debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But while the families of my electorate have welcomed the strength of the economic responsibility shown by our government, they are understandably very concerned about the government's decision to include two sites in the nearby Holsworthy defence area as options for a second international Sydney airport. As the government will recall, this was not on the agenda before the last election when our government won such a resounding victory that was felt from coast to coast across the nation. It is important that the government is aware that, despite the respect within the Hughes electorate for the strength of our commitment to and record of responsible economic management, there is also a great sense of betrayal felt by the people of my electorate in that my constituents feel a tremendous threat to their families, to their homes and to their local neighbourhood communities at the prospect of an international airport almost within their backyards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The EIS is now well under way on the two site options at Holsworthy. Two weeks ago the preliminary flight paths were released. It is appropriate that I draw the government's attention to one of the serious impacts upon my constituents, if it was decided that an airport should be located at either of the Holsworthy option sites. The most worrying concern, which has been expressed to me by many of my constituents, is the high level of pollution that can be historically expected to have an extremely negative impact on residential areas which lie within the proximity of an international airport. With respect, I would urgently draw the government's attention to just how severe and deleterious would be the collateral damage on the lives of my 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> constituents should an international airport be located in the proximity of the neighbourhoods of my electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The United States military uses the term `collateral damage' to mask any unavoidable negative impacts when some more `affordable' objective is deemed to be necessary. The affordable objective in this case is the consideration of the option of locating Sydney's second international airport within the Holsworthy defence area. In this case, unavoidable negative impacts include serious levels of atmospheric and surface pollution, amongst other things. A Boeing 747 does not simply waft into the air in a manner similar to hot air balloons. To get an aircraft weighting just short of 400 tonnes up to minimum flying speed of 300 kilometres per hour takes some effort.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of my constituents is a Qantas 747 pilot who holds a degree in applied science. He informs me that, in order to complete a single take&hyphen;off, these massive jets expel more exhaust into the atmosphere than two million suburban lawnmowers, each running for 20 minutes. Figures from the Department of Transport and Regional Development air traffic forecasts for Sydney dated February 1997 predict the number of aircraft movements in Sydney to rise from 270,000 in 1996 to over 565,000 in the first quarter of the next century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My constituent also informs me that, if the airport is centred at Holsworthy, the direct consequence of these movements will eventually be that around 594,000 litres of jet exhaust fumes, soot, combustion residues and raw, vented jet fuel will fall directly over the Woronora Dam and catchment area every year. And this figure will rise as operations increase. The bulk of these emissions will include minute particles of carbon dioxide, nitrous oxides, water vapour and a lethal mix of organic compounds. From the nitrous oxides we can expect various forms of nitrates such as nitric acid&mdash;otherwise known as acid rain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Eventually from this single airport, some 60,000 litres per year will disperse in the form of concentrated benzene, formaldehyde, volatile organic compounds and polynuclear 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4252"> aromatic hydrocarbons or PAHs. The United States Food and Drug Administration has deemed that there is no acceptable level of PAHs as a cancer causing agent to humans. Even in parts per billion they pose a serious risk. I am informed that benzene has been proven to cause leukaemia and birth defects and that formaldehyde is thought to contribute to lung and eye irritation as well as skin and brain cancer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should come as no surprise that airport refuellers are equipped with heavy industrial gloves and emergency shower facilities to protect them from accidental jet fuel contact. Yet, if an international airport is located at Holsworthy, minute particles of these toxic substances will either be present in the run-off or fall directly into the Woronora Dam and its catchment area within my electorate, and the Woronora Dam provides the drinking water for all of southern Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of these substances are powerful carcinogens and cannot be simply filtered from the tap water that generations of Australians, including my constituents in Hughes, take on trust to be pure and clean. The Woronora Dam supplies water to over 350,000 people living in Sydney's south. The families living in the neighbourhoods of my electorate from Helensburgh to Hammondville, from Como to Chipping Norton, from Menai to Moorebank and from Bundeena to Bangor, have every right to expect clean air and pure water.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is impossible for the current EIS to predict the outcome of contaminating these two precious resources which are imperative to the health and wellbeing of the hundreds of thousands of men, women and children now living in the southern region of Sydney. Only long-term, large population studies can give answers to such questions, after which time the damage may be unthinkable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even without an EIS, one does not need to look too hard to find a predictive model. In the United States of America, Chicago's O'Hare airport is currently operating at levels that we can expect from Sydney's future second international airport. Given the O'Hare example, we can observe an increase in birth defects, respiratory illness, liver damage, heart 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> disease and cancers in the surrounding population. American sources indicate over one million people are affected by pollution directly related to the O'Hare airport, which is detectable at 80 kilometres from the airport and progressively gets worse as you get closer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An international airport in the Holsworthy defence area will be further complicated by the proximity of the Woronora Dam, which is located less than a kilometre from the southern end of the option A north-south runway. The preliminary flight paths released last week show flight paths over the Woronora Dam and the Woronora catchment area from option A and the Woronora catchment area from option B.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The American Natural Resources Defence Council or NRDC concluded in its 1996 report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Flying off course</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Living near a major airport is like having an oil refinery as a neighbour, except that refineries are subject to much stronger pollution controls and disclosure requirements.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">How could it be logically explained that residents, who are prohibited from propelling a small powerboat around the Woronora reservoir `to preserve water quality', are now told that their government is considering the operation of literally hundreds of thousands of turbojet aircraft movements just a few hundred metres from the reservoir shoreline, both vertically and horizontally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am informed that aviation emissions appear as a tenuous, sticky mist that disperse over a very wide area. They attach to vegetation, they burn foliage and they acidify rain. These aerosols cannot be filtered by our lungs and are transmitted directly into our bloodstream as we breath them in. The NRDC found that America's international airports generate as much&mdash;and even more&mdash;emissions than major power plants, steel mills, refineries and incinerators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As legislators, we would be ridiculed and laughed from office if we were to suggest to the Australian people that it would be economically beneficial to place an oil refinery inside a currently protected water catchment. But it has been pointed out to me by my constituents that locating an international 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4253"> airport within the proximity of residential areas, of the Woronora Dam and of the Woronora catchment area is similar to igniting that refinery's half billion litre produce and flying it overhead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I am ever mindful of the strength of commitment shown by our coalition government in the mature and responsible economic leadership it has shown in the management of our nation, for the people of our nation and for the children of our nation's future. In the 1997 budget, our government continues its sound record of political and economic leadership which puts people first. Therefore, surely on the grounds of the serious impact of pollution alone upon the people of my electorate of Hughes and following our policy of putting people first as emphasised in the coalition 1997 budget, neither Holsworthy option should be justifiably selected for an international airport.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Despite its seeming innocuousness, the second Howard-Costello budget actually compounds the assault on decent social standards that they began in the first. It is another step toward producing a society characterised by private opulence for the few and public squalor for the many. It is built on the same dubious assumptions and mindless ideology and accelerates the destruction of consensus and generosity as the basis of public policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget demonstrates yet again&mdash;if we needed convincing&mdash;that the Howard government has uncritically embraced the ideology which insists on the necessity and rectitude of reducing government expenditure and of removing government from key areas of policy. This at a time, interestingly, when there are clear signs that the orthodoxies of economic rationalism and market based resource allocation are being challenged, often by those who were their most enthusiastic proponents to begin with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are led to believe that the reduction in the government deficit is to be the sole criterion for assessing this government's performance. Solving the problem of unemployment and providing for decent standards in health, education and social services is apparently relatively unimportant. This posi 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tion is not dissimilar to views espoused by sections of the business community and the financial press, and reflects an economic orthodoxy which, in my view, has not been sufficiently challenged, particularly given its obviously destructive effects on those who are less well off. I think it is time that more of us shouted, `The emperor's got no clothes.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Familiar too in the assumptions shaping this budget is the pressure to reduce government involvement in policies affecting the quality of people's lives and to replace joint government action with individual decisions made in the marketplace, allegedly allowing the market to better allocate resources throughout the community. Accompanying these cuts here, as elsewhere where it has occurred around the world, is the crude rhetoric of `getting government off the people's backs'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This rhetoric is predictably associated with mantras extolling the virtues of private sector efficiency and greater competition as the justification for cutting government expenditure, for selling public assets and for contracting out services, with the resulting loss of control over both the quality and the cost of those services apparently to be ignored. However, a recent analysis by Hodge of 245 studies of the effects of contracting out amongst some 20,000 enterprises found that, in reality, in areas such as policing, health and environmental management, changes in performance `were not significantly different to zero'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the results of this government's obsession with smaller government is a substantial reduction in the size of the Public Service and, of course, a corresponding reduction in the expertise that is available for public policy and for service delivery. Recent insulting observations about the level of expertise in the service by Max Moore-Wilton highlight the inevitable consequences of his and the government's favoured strategies of `contracting out, downsizing, outplacement and right sizing'. All of these insidious concepts, many now repudiated by their originators, are basically code for removing people from jobs that they previously held and either replacing them with contract workers or requiring fewer people to do the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4254"> same job&mdash;with greater stress, I might say. The expertise in public policy that we have had is apparently not valued by this government since it is being so easily discarded and then, I might say,  illogically complained about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A common associate of many of these free&hyphen;market nostrums that we are hearing from the government is that labour markets should be made more flexible&mdash;where have we heard that before?&mdash;for which read: it should be easier to sack people and pay them lower wages. Indeed, the Treasurer (Mr Costello) recently indicated that greater flexibility could mean lower wages for some&mdash;it has taken a long time to get that concession from him. The new Reserve Bank Governor was apparently unashamed, however, to recommend greater labour market flexibility while recognising very clearly that this contributed to greater inequality in Australian society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This same outcome was also recognised by the Confederation of Industry which suggested the effect could be ameliorated by further taxpayer funded payments to the working poor&mdash;this while simultaneously recommending huge cuts in public service expenditure, except apparently when it benefits business. If the government's savings initiative introduced in this budget and the private health insurance and family tax rebates introduced in the last are indicative of their approach to assisting those on low wages, then it is clear that the real battlers&mdash;as opposed to the ones the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) likes to refer to&mdash;are unlikely to get much at all. Most are ineligible for the private health insurance rebate since they do not have private health insurance; many would not obtain part B of the family tax rebate since both are likely to be working, at least part time; and the savings benefit is insultingly small to non-existent for those with little saved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Underpinning these budget and policy prescriptions is the proposition&mdash;and this is very clear&mdash;that individual gain and not the collective good should determine which services are paid for from taxes and which from individual incomes. For example, it has been argued that those on high incomes should insure privately, use private health 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> services and send their children to private schools rather than paying higher taxes and, with other citizens, creating a universal, quality service which is then available to everybody regardless of means. I much prefer what John Kenneth Galbraith calls simply the `good society': a society where we work together for the greater good and share in the wealth of our community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Much of the government promotion of smaller government and private provision uses, misleadingly, the rhetoric of choice to disguise that shift away from collective provision. Funds are being removed from government hospitals and schools ostensibly to give people greater choice to purchase these services with their own resources in the private sector. While the notion of greater choice is superficially appealing to a great many people, the possibility of choice, however, rests heavily on the individual's income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The inevitable result is a two-tiered system of service provision: one for those who can exercise `choice' because of their wealth&mdash;with private health insurance, private education or private aged care&mdash;and a second tier which is clearly residual or marginalised, the charity system for the indigent. For working families, this choice is hardly a free one. The massive cuts to child care over two budgets&mdash;we have some $820 million removed&mdash;and the flow-on increases in the costs of care have swamped any financial benefits that may temporarily result from the much vaunted reduction in home mortgage rates for those buying their own homes. In some child&hyphen;care centres right now weekly fees have risen more than $50 per child, and some parents are either having to abandon work or study altogether or having to `choose' inferior, informal care. This, of course, is no choice at all, but a government enforced reduction in their self-determination and in their standard of living.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cumulative impact of cuts to hospital funding over the two budgets&mdash;cuts to pharmaceuticals, to aged care and to child care&mdash;is already creating further inequalities of access to critical services and products. These are not discretionary. For example, the recently announced payment to nursing homes 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4255"> of $5 per day for each subsidised resident has rightly been attacked as derisory, particularly by the charitable sector. Alongside last year's decision to allow up&hyphen;front charges of an unlimited amount from those who do have some assets, this decision will inevitably lead to a rich man's and a beggarman's service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, the budget decision to cut a further $700 million from expenditure on pharmaceuticals hits the poor hardest. They will be expected to be satisfied with drugs of reduced efficacy or increased side effects or they will have to sacrifice other much needed expenditures to purchase these more expensive drugs. Many simply will not be able to afford to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have already been contacted, for example, by a number of women about the removal of vaginal anti&hyphen;fungal creams and ointments from the PBS schedule. Since candida albicans&mdash;which usually causes this condition&mdash;is a persistent condition which often recurs and needs careful diagnosis and care, this decision will selectively threaten the health of those on low and fixed incomes. It will not affect the wealthy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Reductions in university funding have already damaged the quality of Australian universities, according to the head of the government's own review of higher education, Roderick West. Mr West has found, from going around those universities, that many universities have cut tutorials, reduced staff numbers and axed many good courses on an ad hoc basis in an attempt to cope with the cuts&mdash;which are not yet finished. These effects, of course, are not being felt uniformly with older established universities, which are typically better endowed, likely to manage the cuts and attract more full fee&hyphen;paying students. This will inevitably be at the expense of the newer and less prestigious establishments, which usually operate in outer metropolitan and rural areas and cater for the less well off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The view that is already held by some of the so&hyphen;called brownstone universities that they are superior institutions will become a reality under this government. Two classes of university will emerge again, this time based on ability to pay.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to attempting to persuade the community that cutting government funded programs means greater individual choice, this government has cynically and spitefully offered citizens an invitation to constantly measure their entitlements and benefits against those of others who seem to be getting `more than they deserve'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is currently a very divisive and calculated exploitation of what is called, quite reasonably I think, the politics of envy and resentment. We are being encouraged to define certain groups as `outsiders'&mdash;as objects for our resentment&mdash;because they get `special treatment'. The irony is that these people who are described as getting `special treatment' are often those who are already marginalised in our society: for example, recent migrants from Asia and our indigenous people. They are being scapegoated. I do not think there is any other way to put it. The cuts to ATSIC last year and to Abstudy this year are clear examples of this policy. It is exploitative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These attitudes underlined in this budget and the previous one are part of a constellation of what I believe are deliberately cultivated values which are eroding the social contract between the government and the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A very ugly side of this value set is the tendency to blame the victim. Those in society who have fewer resources are to be blamed for any disadvantages they suffer. For example, if you look at the official statements surrounding unemployment, which is one of the most involuntary statuses that we as a society can confer on anyone, it encourages us to think that the unemployed are `ripping off' or `bludging on' the system, to use two much used phrases. The last time the word `dole' was used as an official government description of unemployment benefits&mdash;at least until its recent disinterment&mdash;was in the early 1980s, when we were encouraged to think that the 10 or 11 per cent who were unemployed were taking the rest of us for a ride. The reality is that they were not and they are not now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The great majority of people now unemployed would prefer to be in work. And many 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4256"> of those who are employed now would prefer to have more employment than they do. It is the governments which have failed them, not vice versa. The idea that those out of work should be compelled to work for the dole to repay society for giving them something to which they are really not entitled&mdash;that is the thinking behind it&mdash;is insulting and destructive. This budget compounds this insult by reaffirming the massive cuts to labour market programs and ignoring employment growth almost altogether as a major objective of its policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say I was flabbergasted last evening to hear the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) talking about the difference between the government's newly introduced Green Corps, which is a much smaller program than the former LEAP, which also covered conservation and environmental management. He told a rather small but startled audience that the virtue of Green Corps in his eyes is that it is made up of volunteers. The difference between Green Corps and LEAP is that LEAP participants were conscripts while Green Corps participants are volunteers. He goes on to say in the same speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is an enormous difference between Green Corps and work for the dole. Green Corps is an environmental program for young people. Green Corps is a job; it is a job lasting for six months at the national training wage. It is a real job.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Presumably, we are invited to conclude that work for the dole is not. He goes on further and says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Green Corps is very much a quantum leap ahead of the LEAP program because of the fact that these people are volunteers. These are not conscripts. They are not slave labourers. They are not there because they have been threatened with the loss of any benefit. They are there because they want to be there. They are there because they are people genuinely committed . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In other words, these characteristics seem a virtue in the Green Corps. Yet this is the same government that has just introduced an insultingly small program called `work for the dole' which has all of those characteristics that the member was deriding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say that I was amazed to hear the Prime Minister recently, when asked to defend cuts to higher education funds, express 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the opinion that many people who did not have a degree actually resented paying taxes so that others could pursue higher education. Whether that is true or not, the Prime Minister was inviting the listeners to feel resentful and refusing to recognise that there is a substantial collective benefit in having a well-educated and highly skilled population. His statement also ignored the fact that a fair and universal system is also likely to benefit most families directly at some time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true that higher education confers an increased earning capacity on some&mdash;it depends on what sort of work you do; and they do make a contribution&mdash;but if we have a well&hyphen;educated, well&hyphen;informed, highly trained population, we all benefit enormously as a community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government's budget, and its previous budget, and associated policies, do not contain any recognition that there are very compelling grounds for caution in embracing prescriptions which recommend free market solutions to our social and economic problems&mdash;any or all of them. These reservations arise both from the shortcomings in the economic theories that drive them and from a growing body of evidence, which I think we ignore at our peril, that they actually fail to achieve not only their stated economic goals but their unstated social goals as well. Furthermore, I think it is clear to say that such policies have been instrumental already in producing social, environmental and political consequences which will prove inimical to civilised standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we need to be reminded that at the core of the free market program embraced by this government and this budget is the extension of the market principle into almost every part of community life with targets as diverse as health services and university places, with contracting out and market testing being applied to everything from labour market programs to information technology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to recognise too that the emphasis in a lot of this change program&mdash;it is not reform&mdash;is largely or solely on efficiency, not on effectiveness or improving outcomes for society, or improving the status of the disadvantaged in our community. I have 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4257"> to say I agree with John Ralston Saul that efficiency is a low&hyphen;level technical objective, one we expect of everybody. Efficiency is a criterion of dubious benefit when assessing public goods or natural monopolies. For instance, a school may have fewer teachers per student and lower operating costs than another, but a very poor educational outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many have observed that the unrestricted operation of the market can produce perverse, not to mention socially damaging results. For instance, when contracting out occurs, the costs of contract development and the monitoring of performance of contractors is often not acknowledged. The result is the development of another tier of government which is not delivering a service or developing a policy, but monitoring those who have been contracted to do the work. What emerges is a very extensive bureaucracy devoted to auditing, managing and evaluating contracts over which effective control has been relinquished. Just ask Jeff Kennett about the ambulance services in Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am already receiving complaints about the operation of the private sector in providing case management for the long-term unemployed, including concerns about serious privacy breaches which, I am pleased to say, are now being investigated. These relate to highly sensitive questions about mental illness. I have here a copy of one of the questionnaires that is used by one of these private providers. It asks the potential user of this service, `Tick any of the following mental health problems you have had: diagnosed depressive illness, diagnosed schizophrenic illness, mood swings, suicide attempts, anxiety attacks, panic attacks, phobias, hospitalisation.' The person concerned rejected that and resented it and, I am pleased to say, with my assistance, has made that known to the department. But, at the time, no&hyphen;one from the department was apparently aware of these possible breaches. That was a contracted out service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt too that we are seeing increasing dislocation and disaffection as a result of many of these so-called `globalising economic pressures'. Furthermore, as Walter has argued, `It has been resort to a single 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> principle in public life which we've been persuaded to call economic rationalism,' which has been so damaging.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that it is not particularly rational as a framework for deciding how we run our lives. We are told that there are no options. Those who voice objections to this view of the world are derided as economic pygmies or ignoramuses who are out of touch with right thinking. We are told this in the context of outcomes for the wider community which are clearly far from perfect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is fair to say that, wherever these experiments have occurred&mdash;for instance, in the UK, New Zealand and the US&mdash;growing inequality has been their hallmark. Governments should intervene to reduce and remove inequality. Where governments do not intervene, or where they intervene less effectively than in the past, the result is, and will be, growing inequality. Cuts to government programs and benefits will further widen these gaps.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Kapstein said plaintively in a recent edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Foreign Affairs</EMPHASIS> `this is not how things were supposed to work'. Kapstein, along with others, had advocated expanding the role of the marketplace, increasing privatisation and having smaller government. He now decries the fact that today's advanced global capitalism has failed to keep spreading the wealth and that inequality has worsened. George Soros&mdash;also a recent convert&mdash;said:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is interesting to follow the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence), who is probably one of the socialist icons of this place, in this debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1). It is also interesting to try to understand the thinking of members of the Australian Labor Party, and to reflect upon their record&mdash;particularly the record of the member for Fremantle who managed the Western Australian economy, which had to be resurrected. The same could 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4258"> be said about the situation in Canberra and the effects that is having on Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 13 May, the Treasurer (Mr Costello) delivered the second Howard&hyphen;Fischer budget in this parliament. The Treasurer made it very clear that the government had not forgotten the reasons why the people had elected this government. They were concerned about the state of the Australian economy. They were concerned about the debts that had been run up over a number of years. They were concerned about the effects that was having on the Australian people, particularly with high levels of unemployment. They were also concerned about the effects that long&hyphen;term debt would have on this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Long&hyphen;term debt is not just a problem for the generation that we represent in this particular parliament. The real problem with long&hyphen;term debt is what it does to generations to come and the fact that our grandchildren will have to pay because we borrowed on the world bankcard to suit our purposes in this particular generation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the election campaign, the state of the budget was debated very actively, especially what the financial position of the country would be, no matter who won the election. It was made very clear by the now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), as finance minister, that everything was okay. He said that we would have a balanced budget, that the Keating Labor administration was managing the country very well, and that there was no need to be concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we clearly found out with the change of government, and with the first Howard&hyphen;Fischer budget that was presented last year, the accounts were different from what we were told before the election. Instead of having a surplus, as was claimed at one particular stage&mdash;and then that was revisited and we were told we would have a small deficit&mdash;in reality, the budget came down with a $10.3 billion deficit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One can only think that the previous government knew they were not going to be re&hyphen;elected and so went out and spent to try to buy their way back into government. To hell with the consequences; the next administration would have to try to straighten out the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> affairs of this country. Of course, that is never easy and trying to balance a budget having been left a $10.3 billion deficit causes considerable pain in certain areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is to the credit of the Treasurer that he could announce in this year's budget that, while we are still to have a relatively small deficit this year of $3 billion, by the time the term of this government is completed there will be a surplus budget in this country, estimated at this stage at about $1.6 billion. That is really a remarkable turnaround under the circumstances. I think that sets the stage for business and the community to go forward with confidence, knowing full well that we are not going to carry on going down the track of borrowing more and more money overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that this country now has very low interest rates, very low inflation and the budget under control puts us on a very sound footing and enables us to go forward. In fact, the Treasurer made it very clear in this particular budget that, through the sale of assets, $5 billion worth of debt would be repaid. How different that is from some of the asset sales of the previous administration, the proceeds of which were put straight into the current account to be spent in the one year. That is like selling your house and spending the proceeds in one year. It was totally irresponsible&mdash;selling off the farm and doing nothing about debt that might be accumulated. That was a totally irresponsible economic situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government obviously has a different agenda. It is determined to hand over to the future generations of Australia a country that is in good condition and a country that offers some incentives and opportunities. Not only did we show in this particular budget that we had addressed some of the fiscal problems of this country; we also started to show that this government understands some of the things needed to get individuals and the economy moving.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the rebate on taxation on savings introduced in this budget is commendable. I know that those opposite have ridiculed and condemned this particular measure, saying that it is not enough and that people will get 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4259"> only a small amount, et cetera, but you have to start somewhere. I think it is commendable that this measure is being put forward as a policy of this particular government to encourage people to save.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whenever you are trying to save, you do not save a lot in the first year, but as you continue to add to that then obviously your income from savings increases. This is a 15 per cent rebate which is not capped, so anyone who wants to improve their savings situation and continue to add to their savings obviously has an incentive. I think this will be of great benefit to Australia in the long term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This measure affects many other areas. There is always a very valid criticism in this country that we are losing too much of the control of our own companies, that overseas people are buying out our companies. The reason overseas interests are buying out Australian companies is that we in this country do not have enough savings and do not have the ability as individuals to invest in our own companies. If you look closely at our near neighbours in the Asian region&mdash;Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore&mdash;you see that there is a much higher level of investment by those individuals in their own companies because there is a much higher savings level. That is something we must address in this country. This government has certainly taken a very positive step in that direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In an electorate such as Page, on the north coast of New South Wales, anything to do with pensions and superannuants is very important as it is an area with a high percentage of retirees. In this budget the government has honoured the commitment it gave to pensioners during the election campaign&mdash;I think the legislation has been introduced to this place&mdash;to legislatively guarantee pensioners 25 per cent of male average earnings. Added to that is the fact that we have low inflation and should have&mdash;I think there is probably some debate about it&mdash;low increases in costs. That is of great benefit to that particular section of the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Superannuants were addressed in the last budget. They were treated in the same way as pensioners in the eyes of the tax system. I am 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sure those two areas are very important ones the government needs to address.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Harking back to statements by the member for Fremantle, something the Labor Party never seems to be able to come to terms with is that you cannot be a compassionate society and you cannot look after those who are in need in society if you do not look after the income you generate in society. If you do not have anything, you cannot be compassionate. I think that is a very important ideological difference between the coalition parties and the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because I am a regional member, I will devote quite a bit of my speech to regional issues. I commend the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp), and I dare say the Treasurer and Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey), for the allocation of $800 million for roads in regional Australia, part of the infrastructure that is vitally important to this country in light of the need these days to compete on a so-called level playing field. We need to be able to transport our produce, particularly to the ports but also in reverse, in an efficient way and we need to ensure that country people have access to different areas. In this regard, the federal government is looking more at the national highways, at the roads of national importance, which is a new category, and at an agreement with the New South Wales and Queensland state governments for the Pacific Highway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Pacific Highway between Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane is the busiest highway in Australia. It is not a national highway. Some of the road alignment between Brisbane and Sydney is not adequate for a highway of that category. There is no doubt that the commitment given by the federal government in conjunction with New South Wales and Queensland state governments will see a very big improvement in the Pacific Highway. I believe that will be a great advantage to the country and its economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other area that is very important for regional Australia is that of roads of national importance. The one road in my particular electorate that has had some benefit from this scheme is the Summerland Way, which takes off at Grafton and moves through the towns 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4260"> of Casino and Kyogle into Queensland. This is a very popular route for heavy transport. It is a substandard road which has a number of problems; for instance, the very fact that it must go up the main streets of the towns of Grafton, Casino and Kyogle. Some of the alignment is impossible for a major highway, which takes a considerable amount of heavy traffic. The $25 million that has been allocated over a five-year period will certainly be of great benefit in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is some problem at present with the New South Wales state government, because they are refusing to accept that this should be a road of national importance. I believe the government of New South Wales should take heed because they did make a promise before the last state election that they would contribute considerable funds to this particular road. There is no doubt that this is a road of national importance. I urge the government to acknowledge that and commit funds towards it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Something that is very dear to my heart is the $250 million that has been allocated to regional  telecommunications. I do not think there is anything more important to regional Australia than the telecommunications network that services&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government has made a submission to the inquiry conducted by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and that particular submission rested on a number of propositions. One of them is the very strong proposition that the practices 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that occurred over a period of time involving indigenous children were practices that were authorised by the laws in force, as I understand it, in the various states and territories where the practices occurred.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said at the convention on Monday, I continue to feel a deep personal sorrow for people who have suffered injustices under past practices, but I and the government believe, as a matter of law, as a matter of good government and as a matter of commonsense, the notion that, once any contemporary society goes down the path of compensating for conduct which, although at the time it was embraced was legal and was believed by a significant number of people who were involved in it to have been carried out for a positive purpose, however much we now in the fullness of time and with the passage of time might regard that as being an unacceptable practice, there is in fact no end. There will be no end to the number of claims that can be made and allegations that can be made that the conduct and practices of an earlier generation, judged at the time to be acceptable by people on both sides of politics in that earlier generation&mdash;let that not be forgotten&mdash;are now in the light of different attitudes to be regarded differently.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government gave a lot of thought to this. I do not believe that the analogy in relation to guns is a relevant analogy in relation to contemporary action concerning contemporary possession and contemporary ownership of weapons. This is asking one generation to accept legal responsibility for the acts of earlier generations, sanctioned by the law of the times, over which it had no control. That is the basis of the government's attitude and that will remain the government's position.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Makin for her question. I also thank her for her invitation to her electorate last week which gave me the opportunity to meet constituents and young home buyers at Tea Tree Gully who are very concerned about their home mortgage rates and of course welcome the representation that they have in this place from the member for Makin.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can inform the House that the St George Bank yesterday announced that its variable home loan rate would fall from 7.55 per cent to 7.05 per cent. The St George Bank has passed on the full half a per cent interest rate reduction in its standard variable mortgage rate. This reinforces the cuts which were announced by the ANZ Bank yesterday and which proved that, amongst the big four banks, ANZ is certainly the most competitive when it comes to home loans. Yesterday it announced more than the half a per cent reduction; it announced a 0.56 per cent pass&hyphen;on in relation to standard variable rates, taking its standard variable rate down to 6.99 per cent. ANZ customers will have seen their variable rates decline from 10.5 per cent when the coalition first came to office to 6.99 per cent now&mdash;interest savings of $292.50 per month. I encourage those people who are taking out home mortgages to shop around and get the best deal they can.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have also said that this government believes that competition is the best way to get the best deal for home borrowers and business lenders and its our policy of competition which is working. I was somewhat amazed to read on the AAP news this morning a statement from the Leader of the Opposition. He said that the government could not claim

I ask him: what is the significance of the visit in terms of outcomes for Australia and for Australian interests in China and the region?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="4262" SPEAKER="Downer, Alexander, MP" NAMEID="4G4" ELECTORATE="Mayo" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Foreign Affairs" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4G4">Mr DOWNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Hindmarsh for her question and for the interest she has shown in the visit by Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji because this visit, as I reminded the House earlier this week, is the most important visit to Australia by a Chinese leader since 1994. There is no doubt that both our side and the Chinese side believe the visit has been an outstanding success.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a visit that has underlined the strength of the bilateral relationship between China and Australia and also the breadth of that relationship. It also illustrates very strongly the government's deep commitment to our own region and the way in which week by week Australia in broad terms, not just at the level of government but across the board, is building those ties with its own region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This visit particularly strengthened the economic relationship between our two countries. The Chinese side gave a commitment to invest in joint ventures in the direct reduced iron industry, and two memorandums of understanding were signed. They agreed to buy more wool from Australia and to reduce wool tariffs, which is very important to all those members here who represent rural electorates. I think they would be pleased to see the coalition government once more doing something constructive for wool growers. The visit also led to the announcement by China that they would issue a new licence to an Australian law firm to operate in China in the form of the firm Blake Dawson Waldron.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I also mention that in the discussions with the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism there was progress made towards Australia being defined as an official tourist destination for Chinese tourists. As the minister would be happy to tell the House, if the opposition were to show an interest in the issue, the potential for tourism from China is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4263"> simply massive. So I was delighted with the progress made in those talks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, let me say that there were three other issues that came out of the visit. Firstly, both sides confirmed that the human rights dialogue Australia and China are to enter into will begin in August of this year. We are delighted that we have been able to put together this initiative as quickly as it has turned out to be. Secondly, Zhu Rongji made it clear that China would have no objections whatsoever to Australian participation in the Asia-Europe summit meetings. Thirdly, there have been some press reports critical of the Australian alliance with the United States and suggestions that somehow China disapproves of this relationship. I can just say that in response to an article that appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">China Daily</EMPHASIS> a couple of days ago, Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji said that that article did not reflect the views of China's leadership or the Chinese government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So this was a visit which was truly a very substantial success and which has taken the relationship between Australia and China forward significantly. But, I suppose, above all, this is a very good illustration of the breadth and depth of Australia's engagement with Asia.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK></QWN>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question asked by the Leader of the Opposition raises a number of important issues about the future of Newcastle and about the Australian steel industry. It is true that, in answer to a question some time ago, I had some mildly complimentary remarks to make about some aspects of the previous government's policies. Being a person of generous spirit, I have never been reluctant to remind the Australian parliament&mdash;it is a long time ago; that is why you have to keep reminding them&mdash;that on occasions some of the things that the former government did had some merit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nothing could alter the fact that the circumstances that ultimately led to the decision taken by BHP in relation to Newcastle were essentially put in place during the 13 years that the Labor Party was in power. You cannot have it both ways. You cannot say that you had a wonderful plan, you ran the country for 13 years, you got a new government and after 13 months something happened which has clearly been the result of circumstances in train for a long period of time and then turn around and say, `It is all the fault of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4264"> the way that you have run it over the last 13 months.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Newcastle, who asked me a question about this in March of this year before the announcement was made by BHP, in the preamble to his question actually acknowledged the non-viability of certain BHP operations in Newcastle. That was the whole premise of his question. I remember it very well. You lot now come along, devoid of any kind of credible industry policy, as the member for Melbourne has quite rightly pointed out. The member for Melbourne has done the debate on industry policy an immense service because what he has really done is expose the complete humbug of the member for Hotham, the good old Mr Flip Flop on protection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When he was a minister, he used to go down there and make these hairy-chested speeches about globalisation.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HQ5">Mr FAHEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Gilmore for her question. As honourable members would probably be aware, at the time of the budget it was announced that the government would outsource its information technology on a whole of government basis. This sets the scene for a significant opportunity for small and medium enterprises and it will also save the Commonwealth some $1 billion over the next seven years. The initiative is designed to improve the delivery of service, to reduce the duplication of management and to standardise and consolidate information technology across Australia. The initiative will be undertaken through multiple competitive tendering processes over the next two years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to note that part of the criteria for the outsourcers will be to demonstrate a commitment to providing employment in regional Australia and a capacity to partner with local small and medium information technology companies. Already regional Australia is embracing this concept. I have 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4266"> noted, for example, that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ballarat Courier</EMPHASIS>&mdash;supported and encouraged by the member for Ballarat&mdash;has put an article together on its front page which indicates that it is `our chance'. In addition to that, with the support of the honourable member for Bass, Tasmania has recognised this as an opportunity as well. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mercury</EMPHASIS> provides a headline which says `Tassie answers the call'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have noted also that in Canberra a number of companies have already started to take some initiative in this particular area. A group of some 16 small to medium enterprises have formed a partnership in the Australian Capital Territory under the name of Outsourcing Information Technology Pty Ltd and they are going to be ready for the opportunities that will be provided. The multinational EDS has formed a consortium with a small business here in Canberra, a company called Select Computer Technology, also to respond to the opportunities that are there. So this means opportunities for jobs in regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To address the second part of the honourable member's question, relating to privacy, I should state firstly that the property remains with the government. The property in the hands of the contractors remains the property of the government. The contracts will provide very stringent obligations to ensure that privacy is protected. But, perhaps even more importantly, the government has made it abundantly clear that it will extend the Privacy Act to cover the contractors, to cover the outsourcers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A second concern was that the data processing might occur offshore. I can indicate quite clearly that, following further examination of that particular matter, the tender documents will contain provisions that all data processing occurs in Australia. I should add that this outsourcing of information technology was the policy of the Labor Party. To outsource information technology was in the industry statement that was made by the former Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, and in a document released in 1995 by the now Leader of the Opposition</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not one effort was made in respect of privacy by the Labor Party, even though the Department of Veterans' Affairs in 1991 let

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AJ4">Mr SHARP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Grey for his question. He, of course, has a very great interest in this issue and has been very concerned about the future of AN and its work force. Particularly, of course, members on this side of the House have been trying to do things to provide AN and its work force with some certainty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members will recall that last year the government announced a $2 billion rail reform package, which involved the sale of AN to provide AN with certainty that it has not had over the last few years and to provide it with a new owner, with fresh capital investment, with new management expertise and with a new direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This, of course, was seen by many people, in the industry, in the community and within the work force at AN, as the end of the era of uncertainty and death by a thousand cuts which had been inflicted upon them by the former Labor government in its management of AN. Now it appears, following the caucus decision yesterday, that the Labor Party, in opposition today, seeks to block the legislation necessary to see the sale of AN proceed and to see the certainty that that sale would offer the work force of AN and the communities that depend on AN for their future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the same Labor Party which yesterday decided to oppose privatisation of AN and which, when they were in government, were enthusiastic and, indeed, led the charge for privatisation in a number of sectors of the economy such as the privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank undertaken by the Labor Party, the privatisation of Australian Airlines and the privatisation of Qantas. Now, 13 or 14 months after they have lost office, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> they have done a complete reversal of that attitude and have opposed the sale of AN. Of course, if the parliament were not to pass the sale bill for AN, the work force at AN can continue to expect to see the sorts of bad policy decisions inflicted upon AN and its future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When AN was being managed by the Labor Party when they were in government, some 7,000&hyphen;odd jobs were lost at AN. Some 16 lines were closed by the Labor Party when they were in office. Some 1,300 kilometres of rail track were ripped up by the Labor Party when they were in office. Six or seven passenger services were closed down when the Labor Party were in office. Indeed, what the Labor Party inflicted on rail in Australia was death by a thousand cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This proposal that the coalition government puts forward gives a certain future to AN and its work force. The only people who appear to be opposed to the sale of AN are the Labor Party here in Canberra. If you speak to the workers, they have a totally different view of the government's proposals.</PARA>

The same issues have, in fact, been drawn to my attention by other members, including the member for Longman, the member for Lyne and the member for Kingston.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The letter refers to a discussion paper entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sexual offences against the person</EMPHASIS> which was developed for public consultation by the representatives of the New South Wales government on the Model Criminal Code Officers Committee. All states and territories, as well as the Commonwealth, are represented on that committee. It is important to note at the outset that the contents of the discussion paper do not represent the views of this government or any of the governments, or even any of the individual Attorneys&hyphen;General.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The officers committee will, in due course, report to the Standing Committee of Attorneys&hyphen;General, SCAG, which will no doubt take into account community views expressed on the issues in question. It is also important to bear in mind that, under the federal system, primary responsibility for the offences dealt with in the discussion paper rests with the states and territories, and the governments ultimately will deal with the matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the letter, the Australian Christian Coalition is disseminating extremely misleading information about the proposals in the discussion paper. Several of the recommendations attributed to the officers committee are quite outrageous. The allegation referred to by the honourable member is an example. One of the claims made by the Australian Christian Coalition is that the discussion paper proposes that it be lawful for adults to engage in sexual activity with children. This is absolutely untrue. Under the draft legislation proposed in the discussion paper, it would be illegal for an adult to have sex with a child under 16, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4269"> regardless of whether the child consented or not.If an adult has sex with a child&mdash;and even if the adult genuinely believes that the child is consenting&mdash;that adult would be guilty, under the proposals, of a serious offence and subject to severe penalties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While public comments on the actual proposals are welcome, the circulation of misinformation does not assist the committee in formulating final recommendations. The interests of Australian children and the protection of important family values are not served by grossly misleading material that deceives rather than informs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am aware that some of the committee's recommendations which deal with quite sensitive issues have given rise to legitimate community concerns.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The truth is that the Labor Party on this issue has been bouncing from one side to the other depending on who the spokesman is and depending on what day of the week it is. This is what the member for Hotham said on 13 May: `Had Labor still been in government 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> what was announced two weeks ago would not have happened.' What did he say a few weeks later? `What we now need is steel plan mark 2.' Perhaps the Leader of the Opposition wants steel plan Lindsay 2.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now that he is in opposition he believes that the path to political success, economic salvation and building something decent for the workers of Australia lies in cheapjack opportunism, running around any part of Australia where he can spread some misinformation, where he can create a bit of instability.

As he said, in late February this year the Oombulgurri community suffered extensive flood damage, which resulted in the evacuation of all 375 people to Wyndham. I was asked for help in March by the Western Australian Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. Originally this was to be an emergency fix to the barge landing site to get people back from Wyndham.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fifty&hyphen;five army personnel, mainly from Darwin, went to Oombulgurri on 23 April. All the equipment was brought in by barge. They had graders, a crane, medium and light bulldozers, rollers, water tankers and dump trucks. They installed a new barge landing area in a better location allowing easier access and improved the lighting and refuelling capacity in the town. They levelled and resheeted the airstrip, upgrading it to allow larger aircraft to land, as well as doing ongoing maintenance to the community's 33 houses. That included plumbing and electrical services. For extracurricula activities they reactivated some of the waterlogged vehicles along the way.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4274"> cratic principles which underpin our peaceful and tolerant society, and of the institutions which embody and protect those principles. It is clear that many young people do not know about Australia's remarkable democratic heritage. The report of the most recent Constitutional Commission showed that 50 per cent of Australians were unaware that Australia had a written constitution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia is, in fact, one of the world's pioneering democracies and is today one of the great democratic nations of the world. How many Australians, I wonder, realise that this nation was one of the first countries in the world to remove the property requirement from voting; that in Australia women got the vote nationally decades before they obtained it in the United States or Britain; that secret voting in elections is known in the United States as `the Australian ballot'; and that it is this democratic heritage which requires that we cannot have other than policies such as a non-discriminatory immigration policy, and that has made this country such a successful and tolerant society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is our democratic heritage that requires us to recognise the cost of establishing this democratic society, and of course that is the dispossession of the Aboriginal people. And it is our democratic heritage today that demands that we address these issues with reference to the dignity of all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Talking further to Discovering Democracy, the government civics and citizenship initiative I recently launched, I want to make the point that this initiative establishes a very strong historical focus on the history of Australian democracy. The students will study the responsibilities of the different levels of government, how and why the basic freedoms of speech in Australia were established, and the history and role of indigenous Australians. The federal government will be providing some $17&half; million over the next three years to establish the civics curriculum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Civics Experts Group has been expanded in its membership to include as chair Dr John Hirst, the reader in history at La Trobe University, and Professor Greg Craven, the professor of law at Notre Dame University. The remaining members of the group are

Last year the minister told the RSL National Congress that the government would honour its pre&hyphen;election promise to award the Australian Service Medal 1945&hyphen;75 to all defence and former defence personnel who served in that period. Why has the government reneged on the promise to make that award?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SE4">Mrs BISHOP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true that, before the election, there were statements made about the awarding of the ASM 1945&hyphen;75 to people who served in the Korean War, the Malayan emergency and the Indonesian confrontation. I said at the conference that was mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition that we were honouring our promises. I also pointed out that, as the proposal was to award the ASM to people for active service as distinct from non&hyphen;active service, or non&hyphen;warlike service, there was a required change by Her Majesty the Queen to the regulations to allow the ASM to be awarded for active service. I then instigated the process to obtain that concurrence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the course of that, discussion arose as to the question of double medalling, and it was indeed then discovered that those people had been awarded an Imperial Medal at the behest of the Australian government, and therefore it was an Australian medal rendered in respect of that active service given in Korea, in the Malayan emergency and in the Indonesian confrontation. Accordingly, the government made a decision that that would represent 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4275"> double medalling and that that would not be done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government gave the reason that it was important to protect the integrity of the medal already given and therefore the decision was made. However, all the other medals as promised regarding the lessening of time for the receipt of the ASM 1939&hyphen;45&mdash;down from 180 days to 30 days; the awarding of the ASM 1945&hyphen;75 in respect of the Far East Strategic Reserve, in respect of Papua New Guinea, in respect of BCOF&mdash;the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan&mdash;and in respect of the Berlin airlift, were all honoured and have been awarded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was some publicity in the press that said that those medals would be affected. In fact, they will not. I repeat: the reason that the government made the decision arose from the process that I had instigated to obtain Her Majesty's concurrence, and it was then that the discussion on double medalling arose and the government took its decision that no double medalling would be made.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I thank the honourable member. With his electorate and its horticultural production, he is particularly interested in making sure that we take advantage of the emerging opportunities in Asia. The Supermarket to Asia Council, which is actually chaired by the Prime Minister himself, brings together key ministers in the government and industry leaders, and it constitutes a cornerstone of our efforts to achieve the government's vision of a truly 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> competitive Australian agrifood industry which is able to take as big a slice as possible of the emerging action in Asia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia exports around five times as much food as we import. There are some 400,000 people directly employed in producing agricultural product and another 200,000 people in the manufacturing sector in food processing alone. That is the largest single sector in manufacturing in this country. This strategy will undoubtedly bring more investment and more jobs to rural and regional Australia. That is the key message out of this for the bush.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has committed total funding of some $11.8 million to help implement the strategy. There is $2 million per annum, for example, to be used to fund a technical market access program. That will see, amongst other things, two AQIS technical access experts&mdash;one in each of Japan and Korea&mdash;to vigorously pursue Australia's access concerns in those and other Asian markets. Members will be aware of the broad parameters&mdash;some 78 new products now enjoying access to some 35 different countries throughout Asia as a direct result of activities in recent times.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is $1.4 million per annum for three years which has been provided to establish and run the council itself. In addition, there is funding for the quality food Australia proposal and there is seed funding for the assistance of the promotional activities in Asia in 1997, with industry to be responsible for this program from the beginning of 1998.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there are working groups, one of which, for example, is the Asian Marketing Working Group. It is looking at undertaking coordinated retail and food service promotions in Asian countries with Australian food companies, promoting a quality food Australian logo and establishing a network of contacts throughout Asia which will assist current and new exporters with the development of their business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are program such as the `delicatessen', as it is known, to assist Australian food processors to better appreciate the specific requirements of Asian customers. There are efforts being made to promote new&mdash;in many

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We want to build on all of these things, because in turn they will contribute to an increase in the volume and the variety of exports of high value products from rural and regional areas. We are very good at these things, but we want to maximise our opportunities because it is a large part of restoring job opportunities to rural Australia after the mess that you people opposite left it in.</PARA>

It is motion and a proposition which we anticipated that we would have an opportunity to debate here today. People who are listening to this ought to know that that there has been a sense around this parliament for the last three days that on this day this parliament would discuss this report. It has been an understanding that that would occur both here and in the Senate. This day it will occur in the Senate; it will not occur in the House of Representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the significance is that it gives us an opportunity to pass and move resolutions related to it. In case people defend themselves in this place for the fact that we have not had the opportunity to debate these matters by reference to the propositions that were put down yesterday, it needs to be pointed out that those issues that we considered in the resolution on Aboriginal matters yesterday did not go to the matters related to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bringing them home</EMPHASIS> report; they went of course to a recognition in this parliament of the 30th anniversary of the consideration by the Australian people of the referendum empowering the Commonwealth to make laws for the benefit of Aboriginal people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, when that particular referendum was passed, it meant that for these sorts of issues the buck stopped in this chamber.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those things that we are responsible for I apologise, as Leader of the Australian Labor Party. This is a terrible, terrible record. This record does not deal with the experience of Aboriginals in good&hyphen;hearted homes with kindly foster parents. There may be some reference to that and the consequences of that, which of course were the consequences which were the least difficult to bear for the Aboriginal people. Many very decent people took up that fostering status, and they did so without maliciousness and with the very best intentions. This report is not really about them. That is the truth of the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does refer to them of course in the context of the extent to which those people nevertheless, without knowing it, were implicated in a deculturalisation of a race, with all the loss of identity that flowed from that and the extraordinary difficulties that they confronted. However, what the report does detail is very different experiences, experiences of viciousness of extraordinary dimensions&mdash;experience of sexual assault, of physical assault, of overt pressured propagandisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not a matter that we can sweep under this table. This is not a matter that we can stand aside from. This is not a matter about which I direct blame at this government. It is not a matter about which I would believe that I am in any moral position to do so, and that is not what my intention is here today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My intention is to try to provide this parliament with an opportunity that the Western Australian parliament, under Richard Court&mdash;of all people&mdash;and the South Australian parliament, under John Olsen, took without any blush, without any concern for their reputations and without any worry about what might be the legal implications of what they said. They decided that they would stand in their parliaments and apologise; they would stand in their parliaments and make a statement about what their intentions were. This is what we believed that we would have an opportunity to discuss here today. We have not. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4278">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I raised a question earlier on: the question of compensation for the situation in which the Aboriginal people of this country found themselves. The question of compensation is a question which governments consider repeatedly. They consider it in relation to people who have committed acts, either whilst in government or in private organisations, without any maliciousness at all. The people who invented particular breast implants procedures, for example, did not invent those with an intention to do malicious harm to women in our community. Yet compensation is expected of them. What about the people who originally planned, for example, situations which saw folk who were not actually orphans, nevertheless declared such, taken out from Britain and settled in Australia, and themselves experiencing some of the things&mdash;not all of the things, but some of the things&mdash;that the Aboriginal community experienced? There are committees of parliament in other places in this nation which are contemplating the compensation issues related to that. There is no maliciousness there. There may have been abuse experienced in some circumstances, but no maliciousness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To take it a point further, there are equivalents elsewhere in the community of acts which are detailed in this which were perpetrated upon members of the European community, if you like. The Catholic Church is struggling with the issue of compensation now to deal with very equivalent acts to that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why should not the Aboriginal people of this nation be accorded equality? Why not? Why not let the Aboriginal people of this nation have the same experience and the same access? When, for malicious reasons or non&hyphen;malicious reasons, deep personal damage is done to you, you have recourse. Why not? Why should that not happen? Why are they not people who are at least equal to us in the opportunities that are available to them?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not an easy process to contemplate. I was going to read some of these cases, but I cannot. I was up pretty late going through it&mdash;and this would have been a better speech if I had not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Speaker, you cannot walk away from them. This chamber cannot walk away from 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> them. The government cannot walk away from them. They have to be confronted. There are processes by which you can do that. You can do it the easy way, or you can do it the hard way. The easy way is to allow a motion to proceed to make the first step of restitution: that is the apology. That is part of the easy way. The second part of the easy way is for the Commonwealth to engage the states in a conversation as to how they will handle it. The third part of the easy way is to deal with this, possibly, in the way in which the land fund has been dealt with&mdash;there is an opportunity not to do the compensation on budget, but to draw down from it from time to time. The fourth part of the easy way is to get a formula in place, as suggested at length in this report, whereby, for various types of problems, people's situations are assessed and dealt with. That is the easy way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The hard way is this: ignore it and let those compensation cases roll through the court with every piece of disturbance in race relations in this country that follows as, one after another, the courts compensate Aboriginal people for the wrongs done them. That is the hard way; it is the divisive way in this community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I urge the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to seize this opportunity now and to take the easy way for all of us, and to reach a conclusion on this that will ensure that this parliament performs its responsibilities for an apology, and that this parliament performs its responsibilities for restitution. It is a situation that lies in his hands and cries out for leadership&mdash;he must provide it.</PARA></SPEECH>

Do not sit in here with your cheap personal insults and then stand and say to us that the slinging around of personal insults is somehow a pathway to fixing some of the issues which confront us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The position is that yesterday we did have a resolution in this House. I think it is a shame that the opposition were not prepared to attempt to find common ground in a successful way so that we could have had one resolution. The reality is they did not. Why didn't they? Because sometimes it suits oppositions not to find common ground.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So yesterday we had a resolution. There were opportunities for people to speak. This motion to suspend standing orders today is therefore both repetitive to the debate that we had yesterday and pre-emptive of the debate that will ensue in due course when we have a proper, full response by the government to the report that has been handed down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not as though these issues have not been the subject of a lot of public debate and comment in the national arena. Both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) spoke at the convention this week and, as I have referred to already, there has been a report handed down and a statement made by the responsible minister.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that statement he has said that the government does not support the concept of cash compensation. I was very interested in the questions which came from the opposition today on the question of compensation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we treat this motion on the basis that we had a resolution yesterday and opportunities for various parties to speak. The report was tabled earlier this week. The responsible minister has made a preliminary response on behalf of the government to accompany the tabling of that report. But so as to treat the report properly and comprehensively, the government now will, in a measured way, continue the process of consultations with the interested parties so that we are in a position to provide the comprehensive response that this important report deserves.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this motion asks the House to do today&mdash;and this is all it is asking the government to do&mdash;is to agree to appropriate processes to provide compensation and restitution, including assistance for the reunification of families. What this motion is asking the House to do and the government to do today is not, again, respond in detail but to establish appropriate education programs to enhance community awareness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what, above all else, this motion is asking the House to accede to, the government to accede to and, above all else, the Prime Minister to accede to&mdash;because he has abdicated and failed every exercise of his responsibility to date on this&mdash;is to unreservedly apologise&mdash;apologise&mdash;to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians for these appalling separation policies. That is the issue before the House. That is the issue about which the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) spoke so movingly a few moments ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Was that emotion reflected in any way in anything we have heard, or anything we have seen, or anything that we have experienced from that side of the House?

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This bill represents the culmination of a process aimed at providing the Australian wool industry with a clear direction for the future. It is the final stage in preparing the industry to stand on its own feet, unencumbered by unnecessary government regulation and direction. It heralds the end of an era in Australian wool, an era that has been marked by significant debate and controversy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year, this parliament passed a bill providing for the final stage in the disposal of the wool stockpile which was created during 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the last years of the reserve price scheme. The bill I now present establishes the wind&hyphen;up procedures for Wool International, through liquidation, and the distribution of equity to wool tax payers in Wool International.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Above all, this bill represents the success of the consultation process established in the early months of the life of this government which has had the ultimate aim of developing, with industry, a clear future direction for Australian wool, including finalisation of the sale of the wool stockpile, retirement of the associated debt and deregulation of the industry. Furthermore, the government will provide for the distribution to wool tax payers of equity in Wool International, providing wool growers with much needed, and deserved, entitlements to profits from the sale of the wool stockpile and associated assets. The granting of entitlements to wool tax payers will also provide a more secure basis for those wool growers in most need to either sell, or borrow against, their entitlements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A further, related, development in the wool industry has been the emergence of the proposed wool marketing joint venture, Global Wool. This proposal will only be developed, on a commercial basis, with the concurrence of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and the government. I emphasise that the government has no direct role to play in Global Wool. If the venture proceeds, Wool International's only proposed involvement would be by way of establishing the vehicle for wool grower investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill provides a package of measures which will see wool growers given entitlements in Wool International. As well, it will see the development of a loan facility which will allow growers to better use their entitlements as security for loans; provide for the liquidation of Wool International; enable interim and final payments of Wool International assets to wool tax payers; and offer a mechanism to allow growers to invest their equity return in a growers' investment trust, which might participate in the proposed Global Wool wool marketing joint venture. It will also introduce the corresponding changes to the objects and functions of Wool Interna 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4284"> tional and reduce the size of the Wool International board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first and most fundamental of the amendments is that of giving wool tax payers entitlements in Wool International. When Wool International was established in 1993, it was intended to corporatise and then privatise the organisation by 1 July this year. Although the act never provided for this to happen, this government has made a commitment to provide growers who paid the debt component of the wool tax from 1 July 1993 to 30 June 1996, including voluntary contributions, with an entitlement to equity in Wool International.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All wool tax paid up to 30 June 1996, including voluntary contributions, is to be converted to units. Wool tax payers are to be issued a statement of unit holding on the basis of a unit for every dollar of wool tax paid. Depending on the net assets of Wool International, each unit would then have an implied value which can be used as a basis for trading units.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This will give wool growers not only a right to the equity of Wool International, which has been an intention of the act since 1993, but the ability to trade their units. Similarly, wool tax payers will be able to offer their entitlements in Wool International as additional security when taking out a loan with a financial institution. Wool International will maintain the wool tax register to record changes in ownership in future equity and, in the case of a loan over the units, the register will record the financial institution's interest in the units.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Wool International will issue wool tax payers with a consolidated wool tax record in early June this year. Wool tax payers will be required to respond as to the completeness and correctness of this wool tax record as soon as possible. I cannot overemphasise to wool tax payers&mdash;I must stress this&mdash;the importance of a prompt response to ensure they gain their correct entitlement to Wool International equity. When finalised, this register will be the basis for entitlements and equity distributions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, the legislation will allow Wool International to arrange, through a public 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tender process, a loan facility with a financial institution for the benefit of wool growers who hold entitlement to equity in Wool International. It is expected that this arrangement will produce more advantageous terms than would otherwise be available to borrowers negotiating individually. In performing this function, Wool International will be required to complete the tender process by 31 December 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having provided wool tax payers with rights in Wool International, the scene is set to enable the liquidation of Wool International and, in the meantime, to make interim cash payments to wool tax payers of Wool International equity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The liquidation of Wool International will take place by removing reference to the privatisation of Wool International currently set out in section 3(3) and parts 10 to 12 of the act. Further, it is necessary to provide in the act for the final wind&hyphen;up arrangements of Wool International. These include the provision for leftover funds, treatment of small holdings, the final annual report and ensure provision for the wind&hyphen;up costs of Wool International. It will also provide for a scheme for the distribution of entitlements to the beneficiaries of deceased wool tax payers and insolvent businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Interim and final payments to wool tax payers of equity in Wool International is another major aspect of these amendments. Wool tax payers will receive their interim payment as a cash entitlement. The payout to wool tax payers of funds held under section 51 will not delay the retirement of the debt associated with the stockpile.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The act will provide for wool tax payers to have the option to invest their initial payment, from the first Wool International payout, in a growers investment vehicle&mdash;which may subsequently invest in a wool logistics and merchanting venture, commonly referred to as `global wool'. But the act will not involve Wool International other than to facilitate investment in the proposed growers' trust by those growers who elect to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The act will require Wool International to receive my approval to establish the growers' investment trust. Wool International will be 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4285"> allowed to support preliminary steps in the establishment of the proposed trust, and will also be able to undertake, in a limited way, feasibility studies and related activities for possible investment targets for the trust, including the global wool joint venture proposal. As I have indicated previously, global wool will not proceed without clearance by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A final distribution will take place after the stockpile has been sold, and will signal the liquidation of Wool International. It is intended that the stockpile funds after sale and disposal of the stockpile will be the last of the Wool International assets available to wool tax payers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These amendments clearly signal the government's withdrawal from the wool market. Wool International will also be required to reduce its activities to the core functions of disposing of the stockpile and retiring the associated debt. This will result in the phasing out of the subsidiary functions of Wool International and the corresponding reduction in the size of the board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The provision of services to the Australian wool industry, the development of a viable international wool futures market and the development of mechanisms for the sale of wool to allow more efficient management of risk, will be phased out as functions of Wool International.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is, however, necessary to provide for the winding up of several current Wool International functions not associated with selling the stockpile and retiring the associated debt. These are to ensure that Wool International can continue the education program on forward marketing and a market reporting service on a commercial basis. It would be disadvantageous to the industry to remove these functions at this stage and under the legislation these functions will cease by 30 June 1998.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Provision has been made to give Wool International the role of establishing the growers trust an investment vehicle as I mentioned previously. An end date of 30 June 1998 has been included to ensure Wool International's function in this area is short 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> term and on the basis of a simple facilitation of investment by wool tax payers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the legislation, Wool International will be able to spend up to $1 million on the establishment of the investment vehicle and in contributions to the development of the global wool proposal.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the functions reduced to only core activities, it is appropriate for the board to be reduced in size. In keeping with the phasing out of subsidiary functions, this is to occur gradually, with the board being reduced from its present number of 11 to five by 1 January 1998 as the workload associated with liquidating the organisation declines. I would take this opportunity to thank the retiring board members for their valuable contributions during their service on the board. The composition of the new board will be announced in due course.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I stated at the outset, these amendments signal the beginning of the final stage of government's involvement in the wool industry. It will of course still collect wool tax on behalf of the industry, contribute to R&amp;D and continue negotiations with customers on trade access issues. From this point forward the industry will have a clear view of the future and can plan a new, prosperous and independent environment. I commend the bill to honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This legislation is one of two bills arising from issues associated with the sale of DASfleet. The other companion bill is the Commonwealth Motor Vehicles (Liability) Amendment Bill. The government announced 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4286"> in 1996 its intention to either sell its vehicle fleet business, DASfleet, or refinance the vehicles which DASfleet operates. The government decided to approach the market for bids based on both sale and refinancing to ensure the best possible outcome for the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is committed to public sector reform and has sought to identify functions where direct Commonwealth involvement can no longer be justified. In the case of DASfleet and the other Department of Administrative Services business units currently being offered for sale, the government has identified areas which do, or could, compete directly with private sector suppliers. It has decided to divest itself of these functions, while at the same time ensuring a fair return to the taxpayer for these quality businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The operation of the Commonwealth motor vehicle fleet has historically been undertaken internally and the origins of DASfleet can be traced to the Department of Defence in the early 1920s. At that time, the options available to the Commonwealth for the provision of motor vehicles were limited. Today, however, the provision of motor vehicles and fleet management services is undertaken by a dynamic and competitive industry and the case for maintaining a Commonwealth owned vehicle fleet is no longer compelling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth Vehicles (Registration and Exemption from Taxation) Bill and the Commonwealth Motor Vehicles (Liability) Amendment Bill have been prepared in the context of the government's decision to sell or refinance Dasfleet. The ongoing measures in these bills will, however, apply to vehicles leased to the Commonwealth by any company, not just the purchaser of Dasfleet. In addition, because Dasfleet currently provides only half of the vehicles in the Commonwealth's fleet, the ongoing provisions in the bills will extend to any future sale and lease&hyphen;back of Commonwealth vehicles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The two pieces of proposed legislation are intended to ensure that registration, taxation and third party insurance arrangements which currently apply to vehicles used by the Commonwealth can continue once those vehicles 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> are privately owned and leased to the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth Vehicles (Registration and Exemption from Taxation) Bill will establish a Commonwealth register of motor vehicles in which vehicles owned by or leased to the Commonwealth may be registered rather than being registered under state or territory law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The use of Commonwealth number plates allows ease of recognition of Commonwealth government vehicles and has proven to be an effective mechanism for the regulation of their usage. This bill will allow for the continued use of Z and other Commonwealth number plates on vehicles once they are no longer owned by the Commonwealth but are leased for a period of at least three months to the Commonwealth for its use.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also allows for the making of regulations which will provide for details of how the motor vehicle register will be kept and other matters such as how registration plates and labels should be displayed. Further, I intend that public trading enterprises will be exempt under regulations from the coverage of this bill and its companion bill. This will ensure that the proposed legislation does not impact on the competitive position of Commonwealth business enterprises which operate in the market place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to establishing the motor vehicle register, the bill contains measures to exempt the transfer of assets, as well as the ongoing provision of vehicles to the Commonwealth, from state and territory taxes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the Commonwealth Vehicles (Registration and Exemption from Taxation) Bill, the transfer of Dasfleet assets, including the motor vehicle fleet, will be exempt from state and territory imposts. This will allow all Australians to benefit from the full proceeds of sale, rather than a proportion of those proceeds being distributed to those states and territories in which the transfer of assets happens to take place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth currently operates several thousand vehicles which it registers under state and territory law, most notably vehicles which are provided under the senior 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4287"> executive vehicle scheme. While the Commonwealth pays registration fees, by virtue of its constitutional exemption from state and territory taxes, it does not currently pay stamp duty on the registration of such vehicles. The Commonwealth Vehicles (Registration and Exemption from Taxation) Bill will maintain this position by extending the exemption to the private owner of vehicles where those vehicles are leased to the Commonwealth for at least three months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, where a vehicle is leased to the Commonwealth for a continuous period of three months, these leases will be exempt from state and territory taxes levied on leasing arrangements. The three&hyphen;month period is intended to capture leases which could be considered to be long&hyphen;term leases and exclude the short&hyphen;term rental of vehicles for which the taxation exemption would be overly complex to administer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The measures in the bill now before the House are not intended to change the Commonwealth's position with respect to the states and territories. They are merely intended to ensure that the Commonwealth is in the same position with respect to state and territory law and third party liability coverage after the sale of its vehicle fleet as it was before the sale. This bill together with its companion bill will ensure a minimum of disruption to the supply of vehicles to the Commonwealth once these vehicles are privately owned.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Through this bill, the government is furthering equitable access to higher education by introducing a 25 per cent discount for partial up&hyphen;front higher education contribution scheme payments of $500 or more. This will benefit students who have been unable to access the previous 25 per cent discount available only to those students who were able to pay their full HECS contribution up&hyphen;front.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The measure also redresses the existing inequity between an arts student receiving a 25 per cent discount on an up&hyphen;front payment of their full HECS contribution of $3,300 and a law student who might wish to pay the same amount but would not be eligible for any discount unless they could pay their full up&hyphen;front HECS charge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This measure provides an incentive for students to partially pay their HECS contribu 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tion up&hyphen;front and will be of real benefit to HECS liable students. The arrangements build on and strengthen the essential features of HECS to continue to ensure that no qualified student is prevented from entering higher education because of an inability to pay at the time of enrolment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also provides for streamlining of the application arrangements for remission of student debts incurred under HECS and the open learning deferred payment scheme, OLDPS. This measure will make the remission arrangements simpler and more accessible to students by replacing the complex two&hyphen;tiered application process with a more generous set 12&hyphen;month time frame for all remission applicants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of this measure, most students will actually have longer to seek remission of their debt. Students will no longer have to apply within a set three&hyphen;month period which has been an artificial barrier for students seeking to have their debt remitted. The new arrangements make the application process more transparent and accessible to students and are less cumbersome to administer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time, this government has moved quickly to address concerns expressed by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal about the legal limitations of the guidelines that have applied to the remission of debts. The bill will now give legislative force to the administrative guidelines on remission of debts by providing for them to be a disallowable instrument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill reflects the government's commitment to a relevant, high quality education system which is striving for excellence and innovation in teaching and research. I commend the bill to the House and I present one signed copy of the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I was interrupted prior to question time, I was dealing with the $250 million that had been allocated to telecommunications support for regional Australia, and I had noted that this was very important to that particular area of Australia. As a member of the National Party, I believe that to be absolutely imperative if some of the decline we are seeing in regional and rural Australia is to be reversed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all know that, with the policies being adopted by the private and public sectors at the present time, there has been a decline in regional jobs, a decline in regional growth and that many pressures are being placed on small local communities. If they do have the ability to compete with cities with the fibre- 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4290">optic cable, then I think there is a tremendous opportunity for decentralisation of services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">`Decentralisation' is a word that has been bandied around by many governments for many years, and it is very difficult to achieve if you do not have a market or a raw material&mdash;a resource. We do have many resources in Australia. However, I believe that those particular areas in many instances are exploited. Also, we do get as much as possible the value adding that can be found in the natural resources of the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But in this particular instance where there is an argument being put forward that, in fact, services can be centralised with the technology we have today, I believe that it is a very sound argument that those services can be delivered from regional centres. In fact, with many of the information services, the 1800 lines and even computer services, if these telecommunications are available and can support such a system, then the regional centres, such as the great regional centres of Australia&mdash;and particularly that of my north coast area&mdash;can deliver such services. History has proven that the type of work force you can get in regional Australia is very dedicated and very loyal and, of course, there is a very good working environment. That all adds to the service that can be provided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I think the government is certainly moving in the right direction in this area, and obviously we should be taking advantage of it in regional and rural Australia to see that the pressure is put on government and also the private sector to move some of these services from Sydney and Melbourne. When we consider that half the population of Australia resides in Sydney and Melbourne, then there is plenty of opportunity to have some of those services decentralised and relocated to regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also within the budget I note that there is $48 million for regional forest agreements. This, of course, has been an ongoing process now for a number of years. But in New South Wales it has not yet been resolved, and I have great concern about some of the processes that are being put in place in that state. I come from an area that is, and has been for a number of years, very dependent upon the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> forest industries, and they have been very well managed in that area. But we do see a Labor state government, the Carr government, in New South Wales taking the opportunity with these regional assessments to put in place their agenda of more national parks, more wilderness areas, without any socioeconomic studies as to what effect that might have on small country centres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part of the national forest strategy, the national forest policy, when being implemented, was to look very closely at the socioeconomic effects. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has made it very clear that he is committed to that. With some of the proposals that are being put forward being the protection of 15 per cent of forest areas pre-1770, I believe that that type of area must be looked at very closely. There is an agenda in New South Wales being driven by that state's Minister for the Environment, Pam Allen, and it has no regard for those country areas and it has no regard for the effects some of these policies will have upon those rural communities. I think that has to be looked at very, very closely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also note that there is a continuation of the regional minerals program, which I happily say I was involved with when I was the minister for minerals in New South Wales. That program is looking very closely at areas like Broken Hill, which is one of the great mining centres of the world, let alone Australia. But the resource is declining in that area , and there is a grave concern for the city of Broken Hill as to whether it can be sustained into the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you take into consideration that the lode at Broken Hill is no more than three kilometres long and about 230 to 240 metres wide at its widest, you can easily see that such a lode&mdash;given that it might be underground and not on the surface, such as the lode at Broken Hill&mdash;could be easily overlooked. The purpose of these aerial surveys is to locate areas where there might be more mineralisation, hopefully close to an area such as Broken Hill so that that city can be sustained into the future. I commend the continuation of that operation.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4291">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is impossible in the 20 minutes available to me to go through all of the issues in the budget. I note there has been an increase of $75 million for AQIS. In recent times we have seen the necessity for such a body to oversee and protect the industries that we have in Australia. With fire blight and the debates about the chicken meat industry, the pork industry and the salmon industry&mdash;especially under the World Trade Organisation and the agreement&mdash;we can see that an organisation such as AQIS has to be efficient and vigilant to ensure that our great industries are protected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other speakers have talked about the work for the dole scheme. This scheme is important in my area, where we have 16 per cent unemployment and 30 per cent youth unemployment&mdash;an area that we have to address very clearly. Some $20 million is provided for depressed areas. As I have already said, this clearly outlines that my area is a very depressed one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Austudy is another area of some concern. The minister has addressed some of these concerns in the budget to try to alleviate some of those problems. In the little time that I have available, if I have any, I would like to talk about the money provided for credit care&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the second coalition government budget. It is structurally rather  different from the one they brought down last year. Last year's budget was characterised by some fairly draconian spending cuts in a variety of areas. The underlying rationale for those cuts was that the government allegedly faced some sort of fiscal crisis when it came to office, characterised by a large black hole in the budget. </PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that, if you compare Australia to other developed countries, our stock of public debt as a proportion of GDP is very much at the low end of the range. Our deficit as a proportion of GDP is likewise very much at the low end of the range. We are in considerably better shape than most of the countries affected by the Maastricht Treaty in Europe. In general, the claim that there was some sort of crisis that required drastic measures to resolve was clearly untrue. A number of decisions taken in last year's budget have had very adverse effects on a great many people and significant adverse effects on Australia's long-term prospects&mdash;particularly such things as the cuts to education and training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you aggregate the cuts to higher education, which, contrary to the claims of Senator Vanstone, were very much more than a nick, the cuts to vocational education, which, particularly when combined with decisions taken in this year's budget, exceed the extra money that the government provided for aspects of its new apprenticeship and traineeship scheme, the very substantial cuts to labour market programs which the government is seeking to replace with mickey mouse schemes like work for the dole and the green corps, then there are some major adverse impacts on this country, the effect of which will come to bear as the years go by.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think many of those decisions will produce some tragic consequences and will severely undermine much of the good work that was achieved by the former government. The rationale for all this was the alleged need to engage in fiscal consolidation in order to increase national savings. The Labor Party have never disputed the need for a fiscal consolidation program. There was an argument about whether it needed to be proceeded with at the rate that the present government believes is appropriate. The long-term need to achieve a better balance between savings and investment in this country is not something that we disputed. Indeed, the former government put in place long-term structural measures designed to improve national savings. The most important of those was the succession of initiatives in the superannuation area.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4292">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at the various modelling exercises that were undertaken by the previous government, there is no doubt that over a period of decades those measures would have significantly increased national savings. The outcome of those modelling activities was very clear on that point. Contrary to what the present government claims, these were effective measures to raise national savings through the extension of superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As part of an overall long-term strategy to ensure that future governments of this country are in a viable fiscal situation which will enable them to sustain an adequate social safety net and cover all the other various functions of government that governments ought to carry out, we put in place a good framework. For example, if you look at retirement incomes, in the year before last the World Bank brought out a major report on approaches for getting a retirement income structure in place that was capable of dealing with the phenomenon of ageing populations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The kind of model that we had established was pretty close to what they regarded as the desirable model&mdash;that is, one that has the inherent flexibility and capacity to sustain decent retirement incomes over time. It was based on a combination of provisions through private savings and a targeted safety net pension arrangement, and was increasingly supplemented by contributory superannuation. That three&hyphen;tiered retirement income provision was a pretty good way to go. We believe this approach was the right one to get Australia's fiscal circumstances into proper shape for the long term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This year's budget of course did not have anything like the same fiscal impact as last year's budget. When you take into account the major savings measure in the budget&mdash;that is, the removal of the superannuation co-contribution&mdash;and the fact that all that it did was increase the level of public saving at the cost of private dis&hyphen;saving and you factor that into the way you look at the impact of the budget, then its effect on savings is not only negligible but actually adverse when you take into account the tax rebate that was brought in in conjunction with the abolition of the superannuation co-contribution.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is important to stress that fiscal consolidation is not an end in itself. The aim of fiscal consolidation is to raise national savings, and any measure that simply substitutes extra public saving for an equivalent amount of private dis&hyphen;saving really does not contribute to the goal of achieving a better savings investment balance for the country in the long term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we are talking about investment, of course it is important to bear in mind that investment is more than private business investment; it should include a whole raft of public activities, whether it be in education and training, environmental protection, physical infrastructure and so forth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The budget does nothing to increase national savings. In fact, the tax savings rebate reduces national savings. It costs more than $2 billion in a full year and there is little reason to believe that much of this is going to be saved. If the average household savings rate at the moment of 4&half; per cent continues to apply, less than $100 million of this will be saved, so that private saving will go up by less than $100 million but public saving will fall by over $2 billion, which is a net loss of national savings of $1.95 billion as a result of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The suggestion that the rebate will bring forth an increase in private savings exceeding this cost is absurd. The rebate is not targeted to people who are increasing savings. You can be running down your savings and still receive the rebate. There is no incentive for further savings by those already eligible for the maximum benefit of the rebate, and the rationale the government puts forward does not take account of the fact that there are a number of motives for savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In traditional Keynesian analysis, three motives are identified as to why people save. You have precautionary savings, savings for a rainy day. And you have people saving with some target in mind&mdash;for example, to buy a house. Likewise, the rebate makes no difference to that sort of motive. In fact, it could reduce private savings by helping people reach their target earlier but not much earlier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, a young couple saving $5,000 a year for three years to achieve a $15,000 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4293"> house deposit would receive under this rebate $19 in the first year, $56 in the second year and $94 in the third year&mdash;a total of $169 in all. The rebate would help them achieve their savings target all of 12 days earlier. But there is no reason to suppose that this sort of measure will increase the saving being undertaken for that motive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is only for people who engage in what is referred to in Keynesian terms as saving for speculative purposes that the rebate will be an incentive. Again, this is likely to be a relatively small proportion of total household savings. And it is not much of an incentive either&mdash;equivalent to 0.75 percentage points on a deposit paying five per cent interest. So if this was going to make much difference to savings behaviour, then presumably you would expect that we would have had very substantial increases in savings at times of high interest rates. Of course, we did not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rebate is even worse when you set it alongside Labor's superannuation contribution, which it in effect replaces. Every cent of co&hyphen;contribution would have gone into savings and, by association with increased employee superannuation contributions, would have induced a further substantial increase in private savings. So the impact of Labor's measure was unambiguously beneficial for savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1999&hyphen;2000, for example, Labor would have spent $2.4 billion in a manner that induced an increase in national savings. The coalition, in contrast, will spend $1.4 billion and reduce national savings by nearly that amount.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The net economic impact of the budget, once this anti-savings feature of the savings tax rebate is recognised, is a contractionary effect of $352 million in 1997&hyphen;98 and $863 million in 1998&hyphen;99 and an expansionary effect of $403 million in 1999&hyphen;2000. These numbers are derived from the budget papers, pages 1 to 5, and from pages 11 and 162 of Budget Paper No. 2. So it is not a set of numbers that justifies all the rhetoric of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) on the subject of savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even this includes some measures that increase savings from the budget at the cost of other savings, with no net impact on 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> national savings. For example, we have $800 million in property sales. As real and not financial assets, these remain classified as part of the so&hyphen;called underlying deficit. Yet the same argument applies to these asset sales as to others: the money to purchase the asset comes out of private savings, so for every dollar increase in public savings there is a dollar decrease in private savings&mdash;national savings are unaffected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The public debt interest effect of the $3 billion Telstra payment this financial year is another example. At current bond rates this represents a PDI saving of over $200 million a year, but savings by the public trading enterprise sector will be reduced by this amount or more through the increased interest bill on Telstra. The net effect on national savings will be at best zero, at worst negative. That is to say nothing of the reduction in private savings resulting from the transfer of some pharmaceutical expenditure from the Commonwealth to individuals, or of the anti&hyphen;saving effect of some of the government's superannuation measures. The bottom line is that the budget that pretends to be pro&hyphen;saving is in fact anti&hyphen;saving.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other problem with the rebate is its regressivity. The government has tried to argue that the measure is not regressive because it is capped and it is a rebate rather than a deduction. That is to say it could have been worse&mdash;it is not a progressive measure, it is just a regressive one that is not as regressive as it potentially could be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other argument of the government is that low income earners, such as self&hyphen;funded retirees, will benefit. That is, it is regressive in life cycle terms; only people who have had the capacity in the past to build up savings will benefit, and that is demonstrated by the fact that not one cent of the rebate will go to maximum rate pensioners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously, there is a correlation between the capacity to save and income, particularly over the course of an individual's life. Equally obviously, the rebate reinforces this distributive pattern; to suggest otherwise is disingenuous, and to defend it on the basis that it could have been worse is absurd.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4294">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final issue relates to the morality of applying a higher rate of tax to earned income than to unearned income. The opposition has indicated that it will seek to inject some equity back into the budget, particularly through income testing the savings tax rebate. This means that the opposition is prepared to do some of the work to increase national savings which the government has shirked in this budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the time remaining to me, I would like to speak about a number of specific measures. My parliamentary colleagues have spoken about the effect on different groups of people of many of the measures that have been talked about in this budget. I would like to mention briefly a couple of matters that relate to social security. Having been Minister for Social Security for three years, it is an area that I have some familiarity with. In particular, there are some specific matters which I would like to raise in relation to the measures which affect retirees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, the government claims that it has legislated and made provision in this budget to maintain pensions at 25 per cent of male average weekly earnings. The government says that it has met its pre&hyphen;election commitment in this regard. This was announced last year, of course, and funding was included in the contingency reserve in last year's budget legislation, which was introduced on 19 March. The government is trying to pretend, in the context of this budget, that it has announced a new initiative, but in fact it is in effect the third reannouncement of the measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the government neglects to mention is that this adjustment is retrospective. That is, when pensions are adjusted each March and September, they will be aligned with 25 per cent of the latest available estimate of average weekly earnings. These estimates will be months old. With average earnings growing by 3&half; per cent to four per cent a year, this means that at no time will the pension actually be at 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. At each indexation point, the pension will be about 24.6 per cent of average weekly earnings, declining over the subsequent six months as average earnings rise.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In contrast, Labor kept the pension above 25 per cent of average earnings at all times. It was at 25.3 per cent at the time that Labor left office. This is a significant difference. The government, in saying that it has adhered to its pre&hyphen;election promise to maintain pensions at 25 per cent of average weekly earnings, has adopted the most parsimonious interpretation possible of that commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we were in government, we took the view that there were basically two ways you could interpret that commitment. One was that the pension would be above 25 per cent of average weekly earnings at all points in time over the course of the year. The other was that it could be interpreted as meaning that the pension would be above 25 per cent of average weekly earnings on average over the course of the year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that we, in practice, managed, from April 1990 onwards, to adhere to the more generous interpretation of that commitment. But the government is claiming to do no more than keep pensions at 25 per cent of average weekly earnings at two points in time during the course of each year&mdash;at the indexation points of March and September. And, for the reason that I have outlined, it does not even do that because the wage figures that are being used for calculating the benchmark are lagged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what the government has got by way of adhering to this commitment to keep the pension at or above 25 per cent of average weekly earnings&mdash;the mechanism they have put in place&mdash;guarantees that the pension will never reach 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. Even at the most favourable points&mdash;the two indexation points&mdash;it will be below 25 per cent. In between the indexation points, the position will deteriorate further. I believe that this is a very clear breach of faith by this government with retired people and pensioners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The brief to the incoming government&mdash;which we received a copy of&mdash;when it came in in March last year provided costings to adhere to this commitment. It gave figures as to the cost of the measures, which are roughly, even on the less generous interpretation, double the costings in this budget. Even when 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4295"> you take into account parameter changes and so forth, what that indicates is that the government is massively underperforming on this key commitment to Australian pensioners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing I would like to mention is the so&hyphen;called pension bonus plan which the government seeks to present as a win&hyphen;win situation; something which benefits some pensioners on the one hand, but which, on the other hand, also produces budget savings estimated at $42 million a year when it comes fully into effect. The problem is that it takes no account of the longer term impact on the budget of this measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we were in government I, as minister, asked the department to prepare a brief on precisely this sort of proposition. If there was something that would produce budgetary savings and did not seem to hurt anybody&mdash;well, why wouldn't you take it? The reason we did not take it is that it built a significant structural hole into the social security budget in the long term. The reason for that is quite straightforward: once people start to become eligible for a lump sum, a proportion of the people who would benefit from that are people who would have remained in the work force beyond the pensionable age anyway, even without that sort of incentive. So there is a class of windfall gainers and these, by and large, will tend to be the better off amongst the pensioners. It is not a savings measure; it builds in a significant long&hyphen;term structural hole.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was an excellent speech. After eight budgets I ask the question: how do the people of Australia rate the second Costello budget? The first six budgets in my time were delivered by four different Treasurers&mdash;Keating, Kerin, Dawkins and Willis. I was elected to parliament just past the halfway mark of Labor's 13&hyphen;year term of office. Treasurer Keating had delivered seven budgets.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the Hawke and Keating governments, budget speeches achieved an art form of doublespeak and half&hyphen;smart cliches. Treasurer Keating year after year held out branches of hope and promise to all Australians only to then let the nation down year after year. They let everybody down&mdash;the rich and poor, the worker and the employer, the needy and the disadvantaged, the elderly, the aged and the young, the primary producer and the small businessman. They let Australia down budget after budget. I will put that into context. Let me take you back to Labor's first Keating budget in 1983. Paul Keating said in his budget speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Obviously the economic policy of the previous (Fraser) Government have failed to come to terms with Australia's deep&hyphen;seated problems.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Then came the promise of hope when he went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1983&hyphen;84 holds promise of a considerable improvement in economic performance.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That year Australia's foreign debt was $23 billion. In his 1984 budget speech, Paul Keating said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am proud to tell the Australian people that we now have a strong economic growth, many more jobs, a substantial fall in inflation and declining interest rates. The Government's policies are on track.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That year foreign debt was $27.9 billion. In his 1985 budget speech, Keating stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have outlined the Government's strategy for the new financial year. It's a strategy that builds on our very significant successes and puts further behind us the despair and economic failure of the former government.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">How prophetic. By then Labor had discovered that they had a bankcard because our foreign debt had in two years ballooned out to $51.2 billion. In the 1986 budget speech the Treasurer said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4296">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 1986&hyphen;87 which I have presented tonight brings the changes on a more robust, aggressive Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In that year foreign debt was $75 million. That was the same year that Treasurer Keating gave his infamous banana republic warning. In 1987, Keating said in his budget speech&mdash;and how things change in the course of a year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Notwithstanding the enormity of trade difficulties we had faced&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">he should have said `we have caused'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">our economic strategy was bearing fruit.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In that year foreign debt was at $83 billion. In 1988 he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The nation is successfully emerging from its most severe economic crisis in a generation&mdash;this is the one which brings home the bacon. Our foreign debt burden has already stabilised and begun to fall.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In that year foreign debt was $93 billion. In the 1989 budget speech, the Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of government's economic policies Australia will emerge from the recent high level of spending without a recession and with its economic and social structure improving.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In that year foreign debt passed $100 million. That was the legacy of Labor's first seven budgets from 1983. Looking at these budget quotes in the context of performance over time, they reveal a conspiracy of lies, deceit and a perpetration of the cruellest hoax on the people of Australia ever in our short 200&hyphen;year history. They reveal the machinations of a government that governed not for the common good of all Australians but for the good of a group they called the `true believers', the union affiliates, who were growing wealthy and fat on the blood of small business and families from middle Australia. I sat in this House when Paul Keating told Australians in his in 1990 budget speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This year inflation will fall further, the current account deficit will markedly improve and employment will pick up&mdash;delivered without the misery and despair of high unemployment and a savage recession.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Foreign debt that year was $124 million. By 1992, foreign debt was $145 billion. In nine short years it blew out from $23 billion. Despite Treasurer Keating saying that the budget was delivered without the misery and despair of high unemployment and a savage 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> recession, we were in fact in the worst recession since the Great Depression&mdash;the worst one in 60 years. Even given that background, Labor won the 1993 election by more lies and deceit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We were accused of failing to sell the GST. I defy a car salesman to sell a Holden while there is someone outside the car yard holding up a placard advertising, `Don't buy this car&mdash;it's a lemon.' That is what happened. It was not a debate. That is what Keating did to the GST, a tax which in 1985 he believed in with a passion. Labor never governed for Australia; they governed to stay in power. They killed manufacturing, they killed off small business and they killed off our competitiveness by dropping tariff protection without reform and without proper deregulating the labour market. They sold off our assets&mdash;the family silver.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Housing mortgage rates reached 17 per cent and were finally capped at 17 per cent. They had won the 1993 election depriving the people of the reforms Australia needed so badly. The people gave Labor another three years to rack up further debt and economic fraud. It is against this background that we were elected in 1996 in the biggest swing against Labor since the people so unceremoniously dumped the Whitlam government in 1975. They say the more things change the more they stay the same. There has never been a Labor government that has not ultimately been a financial disaster.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Year after year Paul Keating's assurances proved wrong. For 13 years the electorate at large became more and more cynical as Paul Keating destroyed any credibility and respect that politicians and the parliament may have had. The ultimate act of treachery was to knowingly leave this country with a $10 billion deficit when Keating and the current Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) pledged that the budget at the time was in surplus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to remind the Australian people of this era of Labor disaster and deception. People in Australia are sick of political parties which promise the earth but on election discover the cupboard is bare. Therefore, election promises made which 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4297"> require expenditure suddenly become undeliverable. Such actions add to the cynicism of the electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government decided to introduce honesty and integrity back into the budget process and the Treasurer (Mr Costello) delivered this by introducing the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill. Never again will a government be able to deceive the people as Keating and Beazley did before the 1996 election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The growing electoral support for Independents and other new political movements is a straight&hyphen;out reaction against the sad depths of indecency that political processes have degenerated to, particularly during the Hawke-Keating 13&hyphen;year era. Political parties must hear this cry of dissatisfaction and despair. The people of Australia need help. Members of the parliament should reflect their needs, aspirations and vision. We must reform parliamentary behaviour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I urge the new members in this House to mingle anonymously after question time with people who fill these galleries. When you do, listen to their disgust at the behaviour in this chamber. They leave here in the belief that we are arrogant, disrespectful morons. They want to feel that the people who represent them in this chamber are one of them. They want us to spend our time debating the problems of this nation. They should leave the public galleries with a good feeling&mdash;a feeling that they have been somewhere very special, listening to people who have been entrusted with the important task of leading the nation and positioning Australia in its rightful place in the rest of the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The budget process upon election was not easy. The people were told that the budget was in surplus. We had a $10 billion deficit. This government takes a long-term budgeting view. The previous government took a year by year view, lurching from crisis year to crisis year&mdash;each year was a crisis year&mdash;selling the family silver and our great national icons and squandering the proceeds instead of paying off debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In stark contrast, this year the budget pays off $5.3 billion worth of debt. A $10 billion deficit converts to a $1.6 billion surplus in the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> space of three years. The debt to GDP ratio of 20 per cent under Labor&mdash;one of the highest among the OECD countries&mdash;will fall to 10 per cent, one of the lowest in the OECD. Make no mistake and let there be no doubt that our low interest rates are a direct consequence of delivering a responsible budget, paying off government debt and moving the government out of the borrowing market. As I said, this budget process of fiscal consolidation is not easy. Savings had to be made and the burden of expenditure cuts had to be distributed broadly and fairly. Only Defence was quarantined from budget cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reaction to the 1996 budget, which set the foundation for the achievements of the 1997 budget, was very positive. People knew it was time to pay off the bankcard after Labor's mad spending spree. I said previously that the budget process was tough, but it was right. Having built the foundation in 1996, the 1997 budget starts to deliver what we were elected to do: get the country out of the red and get back on our feet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again I say to new members: judge the public acceptance of the budget by the number of calls you receive in your electorate offices. In the week after the budget, I received three calls indicating general approval and acceptance of the budget. In my eight years in this place, I do not think I have had one call from a constituent to say that everything was fine and that they had no problems. So it is fair to claim a positive acceptance of the 1997 budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rather than speak about individual measures in the budget, the importance to my electorate of Fairfax in regional Queensland is the positive impact for business and, therefore, employment. Government was a borrower; government is now a saver. Interest is the price of money. The government has left the money market as a major borrower, releasing funds for lending to others and, therefore, causing the price of money&mdash;interest rates&mdash;to fall. The official interest rates fell within 10 days of the budget as a direct consequence of the thrust of the budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those families with mortgages, investors with mortgages, are the big winners under our two budgets. Our budget strategy has deliv 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4298"> ered home owners with a $100,000 mortgage a $292 saving since we came to office. On the ANZ rate offered the day before yesterday, you would be paying $834 a month less on a $100,000 mortgage than you did under Labor when interest rates were 17 per cent in 1989.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members opposite say, `What about the renters? They get nothing.' This is really when mortgage interest rates are important. It can now be cheaper to buy a house than rent a house. On a $150,000 mortgage, the interest repayments should be approximately $10,500 or $202 per week. Rental for the equivalent home would range from $200 to $240 a week. So why rent when it is cheaper to buy?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the building industry which is the engine of growth in my electorate. When building activity is high, it is reflected in retailing and other small business. The budget lowers interest rates and that will reflect in new building activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Employees in retailing on casual rates lost hours when the building industry turned down. They did not lose their jobs, they lost hours. Many went from 35 hours or more a week to 15 or 16 hours a week. There are already some signs of recovery and an indication of an upward movement in hours being received by people in casual employment in retailing. That augers well for future job creation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The electorate is not happy and many are disenchanted with the government, but they will not return to the Labor Party fold at any price. People want to know why Labor allowed imports to destroy our industries, why Labor allowed people to be sacked and retrenched while our traditional industries went offshore, why foreigners buy up Australian companies and properties when we cannot do the same overseas, why Labor let families and middle income Australians bear the major burden of the tax take, why Labor went soft on so many traditional family values and why Labor let so many of our great primary industries and the economic conditions of farming families deteriorate so badly. Most importantly, people want to know why we have not fixed all these things in our first year in office and why we allow ourselves to be 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> dictated to by unrepresentative vocal minorities who used to dictate the agenda of the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Two indications last week by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) have warmed my heart and have given people hope. Firstly, tax reform is firmly back on the agenda. I am on the record in this place as saying tax reform is the single most needed and urgent thing we can do to take the burden off business and families, create exports and jobs and have a fairer and certain tax regime. Secondly, the government has warned the Senate that it will not tolerate the progress of our reforms being held up by minorities without a mandate. The people want these changes and they want them now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most important aspects of this budget are the macro-economic policy settings, not the individual measures looked at in isolation for whatever reason. The budget is pro-savings. It repays debt. It abandons the borrowing culture of Labor. It restores our economic integrity in the eyes of the financial world. It brings the budget to real surplus, not an artificial surplus brought about by the proceeds of asset sales used for current consumption. The budget entrenches a low interest culture underpinned by low inflation. I commend the budget to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Our ability as a nation to innovate, to generate new ideas, to spread those ideas throughout the productive sectors of our economy and then to bring those new ideas into effect is one of the single most important determinants of our likely future prosperity. Our standard of living, the quality of our lifestyle, our place in the world&mdash;all these are linked directly to productivity growth and to innovation through science and engineering.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is estimated that over half of all real growth in the US economy over the last 40 years is based on technological innovation. Profits and wages both depend on the ability of the economy to deliver ever smarter and more sophisticated ways of doing old things and efficient and effective ways of doing new things. Research drives innovation, which drives investment in industry and commerce, which in turn creates jobs and disposable 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4299"> income for all Australians. This is a vital equation and dependency relationship which must be central to any debate about R&amp;D policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Technological innovation does not usually come about in the way that Newton is alleged to have discovered the notion of gravity. In fact, it is much more along the lines of one per cent inspiration and 99 per cent perspiration. It is a combination of factors with people and organisations, such as firms and research laboratories, building on the work of others who have gone before them and acting in partnership with one another.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the role of the government to provide the framework to ensure that Australian industry, commerce and public sector research and development are encouraged and the results of it are defused throughout the economy as fast as possible. This has to be done in 1997 against a background of global change. To talk about the globalisation of the economy is to repeat something of a truism these days, but the reality of global competition, rising standards of education and skill formation in developing economies and the increasingly open market for goods and services around the world can be ignored only at our peril.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the need for our technology and innovation policies to take account of the globally competitive environment in which we find ourselves is obvious, the consequences of that for domestic policy and politics cannot be overlooked if we are to have a consensus about policy in these areas. I believe that it is essential that a form of national consensus evolve around these issues if we are to have consistency and predictability about policy, a prerequisite for long&hyphen;term investment by the private sector given the fact that capital can find a home almost anywhere around the world these days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The recent government decision to end syndication and reduce the taxation concession for research are dramatic reminders of the way in which policy settings can be changed overnight in a way which frightens off long&hyphen;term private sector investment, especially in the face of our near neighbours, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> who offer even more generous inducements to prospective new firms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Technological change, innovation and the need for a clear policy framework are all part of the necessary interlocking building blocks for a successful economy in the 21st century. The public sector science agencies such as CSIRO, the universities and the private sector must all work together to deliver economic gains to Australia, but they will also deliver gains in areas like health, the environment and other human needs which our community also seeks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth looking at some of these human questions at the outset because they are fundamental to the development of a sustainable innovation culture. At the start of the Industrial Revolution the competition between man and machine was one of brute strength. It soon became clear that the steam engine was going to win out over human muscle and society accepted that after a certain degree of protest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A few centuries later the contest has shifted to a more cerebral plane with man and computer fighting it out over the chessboard. The outcome of that contest is now clear even if Kasparov likes to put his own spin on the result. Human vanity must never be underestimated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the end we are left with human creativity, our will to win and grow and our sense of pride and achievement as the defining characteristics which separate us from the machines we build. After all, it is human ingenuity which has turned the sand into the silicon which beats at the heart of Deep Blue. It is that human spirit which Australia must also cherish if it is to be a major player in the innovation stakes. Science and engineering are the educational cornerstones of any technologically advanced society and the universities play a vital role in basic research and the diffusion of technology as their graduates move into industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Any research based economic strategy must make science and engineering careers more attractive both financially and culturally. The tendency of many young people to see scientists as eccentric nerds in white coats is one of the greatest threats to our economic future.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4300">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The decision of government to place a premium on a science based university degree also sends the wrong signal, especially to the risk averse group of lower to middle income families who are considering future educational options for their kids. Unfortunately, education, particularly at the tertiary level, has taken a bit of a beating lately. The last two budgets have not been kind to many people, least of all the higher education sector. If you add together the cuts to operating grants of some $600 million and the abolition of discretionary funds, which is in excess of $200 million, you have upwards of $800 million cut from the higher education sector over the period of the forward estimates. This does not include the failure of the government to provide supplementation for academic salary increases, which will have a very significant effect on university operating budgets or the further one per cent efficiency dividend which was buried in last year's budget and which finally came to light during analysis of the current budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Estimates of the final impact of these cuts in funding on our universities range from 10 to 15 per cent depending on the institution. That is something of a nick made with a machete. This will hit the sciences much harder than the humanities. Science costs money to do and to teach. Cash strapped university administrators will no doubt find it easier to make ends meet by cutting the science and engineering based courses first.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One US study has concluded that investments in academic research return in excess of 25 per cent on an annual basis, exceeding even the stock market in the long haul. Another study found that newly awarded patents draw upon current findings from academic research at a greater rate than ever before. There is no doubt that California is the premier area for research and innovation in the United States. One of the main reasons for this is the presence of so many major universities working in partnership with industry and government to bring about innovation and to help get leading edge technology out into industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recent OECD studies have shown that technology diffusion&mdash;getting the message out 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to where it can be used&mdash;is at least as important as innovation itself. The knowledge is no good locked up in a laboratory. It must get out into the commercial environment and the universities are a great way to combine research and teaching to produce innovation and diffusion. Innovation and diffusion are body contact sports: you need contact between those who are working in the universities and laboratories and those who are working in industry to deliver productive gains to the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to see expenditure on science and research in universities in the context of an investment, not as an expenditure. The returns are there for the nation as a whole. Expenditure in these areas is a public good for which the government must make provision, not exclusively but substantially and with certainty and predictability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given the acknowledged importance of our human capital, what else can we do to encourage innovation and to foster research that is relevant and productive? You cannot do good science without a sound base. This applies not only to the base of scientific knowledge on which each generation of scientists builds but also to the research and skills infrastructure and to the public policy structure which underpins private sector investment in R&amp;D.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most obvious need is for private sector investment in research and development. Australia has lagged behind other OECD nations in this area in the past. The tax concession introduced by the former government addressed this problem in a serious way and business was beginning to respond. As I said earlier, the sudden reduction in the value of this concession from 150 per cent to 125 per cent may be expected to have a long&hyphen;term negative effect on both actual levels of expenditure and on the board&hyphen;room psychology of the culture of research and development, which is almost as important in the long run. A sustainable research culture depends upon a continuing commitment by those who direct private capital investment and certainty of public policy is a major determinant of their future action.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4301">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The taxation mechanism is one way of encouraging private sector investment in research, but it needs to be recognised that business tends to underinvest in long&hyphen;term research and in public&hyphen;good research. That is where direct federal government investment is essential. Basic research must remain a focus for the government, and that is why I was very concerned by the long&hyphen;term cuts to the budgets of organisations like CSIRO, ANSTO and AIMS as well as the grant funding bodies like the ARC and the NHMRC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The federal commitment to research is shown to decline in the out years of the budget well past the turn of the century. The Minister for Science and Technology (Mr McGauran) has claimed that the budget was kind to research, to public sector support for science and to agencies like CSIRO in particular. On budget night, the minister claimed that the government had increased direct Commonwealth spending for science and innovation by $43 million in 1997&hyphen;98 to a total of some $3.55 billion. The minister also claimed that CSIRO would receive an extra five per cent in funding. Unfortunately, those claims simply do not stack up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality of Commonwealth support for science, research and innovation can be found in the government's own science and technology budget statement for 1997&hyphen;98, which was released a few days after the budget together with the departmental portfolio statements. These show that, when you factor out the effect of inflation, there will actually be a cut to funding of about $38 million or 1.3 per cent. Those figures are contained in the government's own statement which, unfortunately, was not released on budget night, and I would challenge the minister in future budgets to release that statement on budget night so that everyone can have a real and ready reference from the government's own sources as to the reality of its budget rhetoric. Having those two documents available on the same day as the budget is critical to budget analysis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has also been a silent unheralded revision of the projected effects of the cuts made in last year's budget. The stated inten 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tion then was to reduce the level of expenditure by some 5.1 per cent in real terms. The revised cut is more like 9.6 per cent in real terms. The minister has made history through his ability to cut science and technology funding&mdash;unfortunately, history made for all the wrong reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">CSIRO is an icon for Australian public sector science and a model of how the public sector can form effective and valuable partnerships with industry, especially in the traditional areas of agriculture, resources and manufacturing, as well as in the exciting new areas of opportunity like genetic engineering and information technology as well. The government promised in its election policy documents to increase funding to CSIRO by $60 million. It did that all right but, as we saw in the first budget, its generosity was very short&hyphen;lived. It demanded increased efficiency dividends from CSIRO and indulged in some corporate asset stripping requiring CSIRO to repay in total all the increases it had received, and then some. The government's understanding of accounting tricks is somewhat better than its understanding of the needs of science.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has sought to justify this mean&hyphen;spirited treatment of one of our premier research and development institutions by claiming that it could have been worse. Of course, it was worse. This year's budget sees the CRCs cut by some $10 million over two years. Cooperative research centres are a vital part of our research infrastructure, and this will also have an indirect impact on the CSIRO.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Partnerships, and the CRC concept in particular, is also an area that is essential to the long&hyphen;term sustainable research driven future we would all like to see for Australia. The CRC model seeks to tackle both technology diffusion and innovation. It brings together industry and the public sector in a way that encourages the exchange of ideas and the transfer of new technologies. The government's response to the successful model: cut funding. Existing CRCs will now find their room to grow severely constrained by the funding cuts and new proposals will be that much harder to get off the ground.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4302">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Speaking of getting things off the ground, the space CRC seems to have gone from our radar screens altogether&mdash;an important industry sector for Australia. Where is it now? The government abandoned the national space program and moved resources to CSIRO and the space CRC, yet this sector does not appear in CSIRO's annual expenditure profile statement for 1997&hyphen;98. I look forward to the minister's explanation of how all this makes for a bright future for our space industry, and I sincerely hope I have misjudged his intentions but the facts do not support an alternative choice at this stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The situation in respect of the Antarctic and Southern Ocean CRC is even worse. Because of funding guidelines that require external industry support for the CRC to obtain further funding&mdash;an absurd proposition for the Antarctic CRC given our international obligations against the commercial exploitation of Antarctica&mdash;the government proposes to allow this CRC to lapse when its funding runs out. This is a tragedy for Hobart, a tragedy for Australian climate change research and a tragedy for Antarctic and Southern Ocean research. The public&hyphen;good argument for this particular CRC is overwhelming,   and the failure of the government to be sufficiently flexible so as to accommodate this CRC within the program illustrates its inability to grasp the significance of the work or the nature of the cooperative regime that the CRC model encourages. I appeal to the government to re&hyphen;examine the case of the Antarctic and Southern Ocean CRC. This is a vital component of our research effort in Antarctica.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the reasons that the former government adopted the syndication mechanism for taxation concessions for R&amp;D was that those with the capital are rarely that technologically innovative, but those small new firms with lots of ideas rarely have the funds to bring them to market as fast as modern conditions demand. Some variation of the syndication taxation model and legal encouragement to form pre&hyphen;competitive research groups must be high on the agenda of any government concerned to foster innovation in a small economy like ours.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We must use every technique at our disposal to ensure that research, innovation and technology are supported, and that means going beyond the obvious areas I have mentioned so far. Questions of the level of protection for intellectual property rights, the communication system available throughout the nation, freedom of expression, quality of life for people at all levels of the work force and reform of the economy generally are very much part of that equation. Even decisions like the commitment to long&hyphen;term funding programs for research based institutions can have a marked effect on output.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another vital area of the budget in science and technology is information technology. The Australian government's response in the context of a massive shift throughout the world to use and develop information technology is to sell our IT infrastructure to overseas multinationals. While I accept that, under limited circumstances involving partnerships with the private sector, outsourcing has a role to play, there are a number of problems with the current proposals to outsource IT by this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The large scale of the shift is significant. At the end of the process, the government will have little or no expertise in&hyphen;house to enable it to control and manage future developments. The problem is that you cannot manage what you do not understand. I think that the government does not understand the nature of the IT industry and the nature of the loss to Australia and the government when that is sold and the infrastructure is no longer under the direct control of the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the major concerns has got to be privacy. No&hyphen;one has any illusion that this government will act to safeguard privacy. The assurance we had from the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) today that the Privacy Act will be extended to cover outsourcing is a worthwhile step. He has taken that only under pressure from the public and the opposition, but the critical factor is: will that legislation be enacted and be in place before the outsourcing contracts are let? I doubt it, given the government's present level of commitment to this area of privacy. The reality is that, for us to have any confidence 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4303"> in that, the legislation has to be in place before the outsourcing contracts are let to the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unresolved questions also exist across the board about the extent of savings that will be obtained from the outsourcing structure, the way in which employees' rights will be protected and safeguarded and the need for an industry policy for IT given the large scale of the information technology infrastructure which is being given to the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue of industry policy will return to haunt this government at every turn. The reality is that they do not have an industry policy to protect the steel industry and they do not have an industry policy to protect the IT and communications industry. Our trade deficit in this area continues to get worse. Recent ABS figures show that our trade deficit in IT goods and services and communications was a total of over $7 billion. What is the government doing to ensure that that is rectified?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Science has a vital role to play in any budget deliberation. This budget speech ignored science and technology. That a budget speech on the eve of the 21st century can fail to mention science, innovation, engineering and education is an enormous misunderstanding of the importance these areas will play in the future of Australia. Australia must invest in a sound research and technology capacity. It is a challenge which this budget fails to meet. The consequences of that failure will be felt for a generation and beyond.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The 1997&hyphen;98 budget has been widely acclaimed as one which will help families, boost small business, create jobs and encourage savings. Some people have described it as too tough and others have described it as not tough enough. On balance, I think, as the member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay) was saying earlier, it has been very well received, and a measure of that is the input that we have had from our constituents on it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, it represents a monumental turnover in the Commonwealth finances: from the $10 billion deficit that we were faced with when we took over from the previous government to what will be an underlying surplus in the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 1998&hyphen;99 budget. As I also heard the member for Fairfax saying, that is directly responsible for the low interest rate regime which is now firmly in place and which will benefit Australian families and businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might also say that the results we have achieved to date&mdash;to the great credit of the Treasurer (Mr Costello)&mdash;have been largely achieved without tax increases. I am pleased to see that not only is this government committed to lower taxes as a matter of policy but that the Prime Minister has put on the record his commitment to comprehensive and detailed tax reform, which is absolutely vital.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of the budget measures impact favourably on my own constituents in McPherson. I am pleased that there is at last some tangible recognition for carers. I happen to have the largest number of over 65&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds of any electorate in Australia. For a long time, the previous government failed to recognise adequately the amount of money that carers have saved the government and the very hard work they actually do. So I am very pleased to see the government announce in the budget a 28 per cent increase in the domiciliary nursing care benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might also say how pleased I am that we are starting to see the effects of the Natural Heritage Trust. It is already impacting on my electorate where the Surfrider Foundation has been given a grant for its Respect the Beach campaign. In an electorate like mine&mdash;based as it is on the Gold Coast where tourism and our beaches are so vital&mdash;that particular campaign is one that I support strongly and I am pleased to see that it is being funded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as tourism is concerned, again the budget was very positive and there are benefits there as we run downhill towards the Sydney 2000 Olympics. Additional money has been given in the budget to the Australian Tourist Commission and I believe that money will be used well. There is no doubt in my mind or in the minds of many of my constituents that the Sydney Olympics is not just about two weeks in the year 2000; it is about the years before and the years after. The whole of Australia will benefit from Sydney staging the 2000 Olympics.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4304">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should say that tourism continues to be a vital industry for Australia. It is responsible for more than $8 billion of what are effectively export earnings for this country, and that probably makes it Australia's major export earner. Therefore, I am pleased that in this budget the government has given tourism full export industry status by extending the export market development grants scheme to the tourism industry on the same grounds as it is available to other exporters. The previous government, for 13 years, failed to recognise the importance of the tourism industry in that situation. The member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) is frowning. He does not need to be reminded about that particular decision in respect of the export market development grants scheme, I am sure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tourism industry continues to grow strongly despite the anti&hyphen;Asian comments of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). It needs to be understood&mdash;and it needs to be said in my electorate, which is absolutely tourism based&mdash;that these comments are a serious threat to our tourism industry. Let the point be made clearly by me and, I hope, by others in this place that those sorts of anti&hyphen;Asian sentiments are very much against Australia's interest as far as our tourism industry is concerned. I also believe they are representing a threat to the wider interests of Australia in our relationships with our Asian neighbours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday's debate in parliament on the motion by the Prime Minister on Aboriginal reconciliation was an important debate. I am pleased in the end that the Prime Minister's motion was supported almost unanimously. The member for Oxley actually took part in that debate. I was interested to reread her comments in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. There is no doubt that this particular week has been a turbulent week, not only here in Canberra but in Australian politics and in Australia generally. Events in the parliament today reflected that. It is a very emotional issue that we are currently faced with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) for his speech in the parliament today. I thought it was a genuine speech. The motion, in a sense, may have been something of a political stunt&mdash;I do not know. But I do 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> not in any way diminish that his remarks were made absolutely sincerely. I did not think they were helped, incidentally, by the member for Banks (Mr Melham), who took the opportunity to make it a political issue rather than to seek some genuine bipartisan solution to the current serious problem which we face as a nation and, I think, which is broadly acknowledged on both sides of the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the resolution that was carried almost unanimously yesterday, the process of reconciliation in the course of events this week has not been assisted. Some people in Australia, no doubt, care little for the process of reconciliation. I happen to care about it. For the sake of our future as a nation I believe there must be reconciliation. The member for Oxley says, and reiterated yesterday, `I resent being made to feel guilty for something I did not do.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having thought about those sorts of remarks over the years I have been here, having been here through the Mabo debate and events before and since, I do not think we are talking about people feeling guilty; what we are talking about is people accepting responsibility. We cannot ignore our history. I thought an analogy might be that we expect today's generation of Japanese not to feel guilty about the Second World War but to understand their history, accept it and accept some responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, we also demand an apology from the Japanese, which has never been forthcoming, for the way they treated Australian prisoners of war. That does not mean we do not operate with Japan as a close friend and trading partner at all, but we still have those demands which we place upon them and we do expect at some future time to have an unequivocal apology from the Japanese government of today for what they did to Australian prisoners of war, in particular, in the early 1940s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have got a serious problem in our nation at the moment and it is not going to go away. It is no good people saying that they do not want to feel guilty about it, that they do not want to hear about it, that they do not want to know about it, that it is not their problem. It is their problem; it is our problem. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4305"> Reconciliation, as I see it, is a process. It is a journey but it has an ultimate destination. Basically it requires forgiveness on all sides and an understanding on all sides.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that those who turned their backs on the Prime Minister during his address at the national reconciliation conference became part of the problem, not the solution. I am pleased that Dr Lois O'Donoghue today, as I understand it, has offered to apologise to the Prime Minister for their having done so. If my understanding is correct, I congratulate her and believe that is the sort of action that needs to underpin reconciliation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that we can reach the destination that we are headed towards and we can do it by the year 2001, but it will require goodwill and forgiveness on all sides. Fault on all sides has got us where we are today. The member for Oxley, again in her speech yesterday, called for the abolition of ATSIC.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure the member for Kalgoorlie thinks it is a good idea. The formation of ATSIC was not strongly supported on this side of the House when we were in opposition. In fact I think we sought to oppose it for very good reasons. But it is today a fact of life and from the  Aboriginal point of view the right to self&hyphen;determination is fundamentally important. There is no doubt that ATSIC has not been perfect&mdash;far from it. Everybody acknowledges that. The government&mdash;and the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) in particular, to his credit&mdash;is addressing many of its deficiencies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government in the budget&mdash;and we are dealing particularly in this debate with the budget and the Aboriginal affairs portfolio appropriations&mdash;showed clearly that it is moving towards a goal of greater economics and independence for indigenous people through their self&hyphen;empowerment. I am pleased that ATSIC funding will be guaranteed now for four years to give the ATSIC board, under its new leadership, a fair go and to give it greater flexibility with program planning and, indeed, more financial security.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And not true. We have many challenges ahead of us as a nation. The eyes of the world will be on Australia as we head down the track towards the 2000 Olympics. What I think Australians need to come to grips with is the question of what we want the world to see when they look at Australia. We want them to see hopefully a nation that is united. We do not want them to see a nation that is divided by the hatred and prejudice that we hear coming from people, even a limited number of people in this place. We want them to see a united nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We want to be proud of Australia in the year 2000 when the Olympics are held in Sydney. Running an Olympic Games is not an easy task. It is easy to criticise some of the arrangements but, in the end&mdash;the opposition whip, the member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay) represents a Sydney electorate&mdash;Sydney will do a fine job and we will put on a great Olympic Games, perhaps the best one ever, and all Australians will be proud of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But let us be certain that we face the challenges that we have ahead between now and then. The challenge of reconciliation is one of the greatest. I do not pretend that it is easy. I am by no means one of the wets, as one of the Sydney papers portrays us, surrounding the Prime Minister trying to&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I actually happen to believe even more strongly that there is a spiritual dimension to this process of reconciliation that I am acutely aware of. I believe that Australia is diminished as a nation until the issue is resolved. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4306"> It will not be resolved by shallow, populist rhetoric.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government understands, and it is reflected again in the budget papers in this particular area, the imperative of overcoming the disadvantage suffered by Aboriginal Australians. I am pleased that many initiatives have been taken in the budget to deal with that particular fact. We cannot deny it is a fact. There are some people who think that it does not exist or who want it to go away. Once again, we cannot deny the fact that Aborigines are amongst the most disadvantaged of Australians. In that context, I think we can argue that, because of that&mdash;and because all of our welfare system, as extensive as it is, is based on need&mdash;their needs are amongst the greatest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of life expectancy amongst Aboriginals, only one in three will live to the age of 65. They have 2.6 times the level of unemployment of other Australians. As far as education is concerned, half of them leave school before 16 compared to only a quarter of other Australians. Some Aborigines still do not attend school at all. In all of these areas, they are severely disadvantaged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government, which I am pleased and proud to be a part of, is addressing those issues. It is not easy. I do not want to overstate the political side of it, but hopefully some of my colleagues on the other side might, in quieter moments, acknowledge that money has been wasted, and, in many respects, wasted for political purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is behind us. This government is aware of the widespread concern in the community about that, and the understandable and justifiable concern in the community about that. But now this government is doing something about the problem. I believe it deserves credit for that. As I read the budget papers in respect of the Aboriginal affairs portfolio, it is clear that something is being done about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, in the context of this budget debate, I want to say a couple of words about something in the Attorney-General's portfolio which has become dear to my heart. I am the Chairman of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the National Crime Authority. I was very pleased to see the additional funding of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> $20.4 million in the budget over three years to target fraud against the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been, in recent times, some criticism of the NCA. In a sense, it is an organisation that will always be operating on the edge and one which will always be vulnerable to criticism. There are those who say its powers are too great. There are many who say its powers are not great enough to do the important job that it has been given to do. The member for Kalgoorlie seems to want to fit into the former category. Let me put it to him that the NCA, the National Crime Authority, is in the forefront of the fight against organised crime&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I assume the member for Kalgoorlie thinks that it is important that we do have a concerted effort in this country to combat organised crime and the war against drugs. I assume the member for Kalgoorlie is in favour of us taking the threat that drugs represent in our society seriously. If he does, then he will understand that the NCA, the National Crime Authority, is at the forefront of that fight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I put it to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the war against drugs can and must be won. I do not think that, in recent years, despite the efforts of the NCA, we have made the inroads we should have. Perhaps resources is one of the answers as to why not. That is why I am pleased that the NCA has been given additional support by the government in this year's budget. In these times of financial stringency when budgets, generally, are being trimmed, $20.4 million over three years is a significant vote of confidence by the government in the National Crime Authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not believe that we can surrender in this war against drugs by promoting soft laws as some, including the member for Kalgoorlie, would advocate. I do not believe that is an option. The war against crime can and must be won. I am pleased that I have the opportunity of being chairman of that important committee. As I say, I am particularly pleased that the government has seen fit to give the National Crime Authority a significant vote of confidence in the current budget.</PARA>

When I finished my Higher School Certificate my father often encouraged me to do law rather than engineering. On a day like today, I wish I had considered a career in law rather than engineering.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason why the opposition is seeking to move this additional amendment is that, due to an oversight on our part, we have failed to delete a crucial clause in the legislation. Just to give the background for the House and honourable members, when this measure was first introduced to the House, the government's intention was to remove the right of two groups to access the services provided by Australian Hearing Services. The two groups affected were 19&hyphen; to 21-year-olds with hearing disabilities&mdash;that is, deaf kids&mdash;and also several tens of thousands of seniors, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> being those people who hold health care cards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition believed that it was unfair to take away from those two groups the right of access to Australian Hearing Services. Our amendments were rejected in the House of Representatives. But we were very pleased that the government picked up one set of amendments that agreed to not proceed with the measure that would affect deaf children between the ages of 19 and 21. Also, there was a majority in the Senate, made up of the opposition together with the support of the Democrats and Senator Harradine&mdash;and I am not sure whether Senator Colston was helpful&mdash;ensuring our ability to amend the legislation in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem was&mdash;and this was our mistake&mdash;that, despite the collective wisdom of the opposition, the Democrats and Senator Harradine, we amended one part of the legislation: we deleted item 3 from schedule 1 of the legislation, which removed subsections (ac) and (ad) from section 5A(1) from the Hearing Services Act. What we failed to notice was that another part of the legislation, item 23 of schedule 1, deletes all of section 5 from the Hearing Services Act. In fact, it takes out of the Hearing Services Act 1991 the eligibility provisions and places them within the Hearing Services Administration Bill 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, I know that you and every other member would have known that is as clear as mud and would have quite obviously realised that the opposition should have moved two amendments rather than one to try to protect seniors. That is the mistake that we have made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the effect of this? The effect of it is that the opposition, the Democrats and Senator Harradine have protected the senior health care card holders and they will retain their eligibility until 1 July. After 1 July, the government's item 23 of schedule 1 bites, and those seniors lose their eligibility on 1 July.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem is that the group of people affected are, in many cases, farmers, self-funded retirees&mdash;people who are perhaps asset rich but income poor. The opposition believes that, having extended this concession to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4308"> seniors five years ago, it is quite penny pinching of the government to seek to take away from people such as farmers and those self-funded retirees the right to be looked after by Australian Hearing Services. What does it do? Australian Hearing Services ensures that, if those elderly Australians are assessed as needing a hearing-aid, a hearing&hyphen;aid is fitted, provided and maintained. It is a service which is quite helpful to those many self-funded retirees around Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given that I understand the government intend to accept the opposition's first amendment, which extends the eligibility of the senior card holders till 1 July, if they are serious about making sure that these people are protected, they will allow the opposition to move this additional amendment which does seek to ensure that the eligibility is protected forever, not just until 1 July. With that, I will try to finish early to make sure that we move through this as quickly as possible. But the point we are trying to make is that this is the best way to make sure that those 33,000 seniors do continue to have access to Australian Hearing Services.</PARA></SPEECH>

We have failed to do that, with the surprising failure of our attempt to suspend standing orders. We are now seeking to install this right of eligibility into the legislation.</PARA>

We are simply asking the government to extend the same concession to senior card holders. I understand there are about 33,000 of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the past we were told that there was no saving as a result of this change. There was a discussion about that in the consideration in detail stage with the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan). All of the information which we have been provided with to date was that the savings were zero over the forward estimates. We do not think it will bankrupt the government to allow these 33,000 senior card holders the right to continue to have hearing aids assessed, fitted and maintained. For those reasons, the opposition is supporting this amendment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking on the Appropriation Bill I want to reflect on the budget and some of the effects the budget will have. It is, in my view, quite a clever budget. It does not offend any group in society with any power and it is, in fact, an ideal budget on which to go to a double dissolution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does not, however, do a lot. I think its great distinguishing feature is the lack of industry policy, although there are some things in the budget which I applaud. I applaud the government's reduction of the taxation level on savings. I do so because it institutionalises it in the system and, hopefully, the scheme can be made more practical and less regressive in some future budget. I think this could be done by either reducing the amount of taxation involved or giving a complete exemption, thereby benefiting people on lower incomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I want to deal with industry policy. It is quite clear that there is no recognition of the need for a policy. In fact, one 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> would almost think it is anathema to the interests of the nation. The problem we have in Australia is not clearly understood by the Labor Party. Indeed, although I think the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) understands it, he does not have the intellectual rigour to apply it. Industry policy is a mixture of a lot of things. You cannot talk about industry policy in isolation. You have to talk about education, training and immigration. You have to talk about a whole host of other costs to society. That is clearly something which the member for Melbourne is not prepared to do. In my view, his posturing on industry policy has a rather hollow ring. I think the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) has a much better idea about it. It remains to be seen whether the member for Perth will be able to influence the Labor Party in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many things which a government can do in industry policy. It is not just, as some people say, a matter of bringing back tariffs. This would do as much damage as good. It is certainly a policy which I would not advocate. It does not mean that I resile from tariffs. I think there is a place for them, as there is for bounties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A clear example is that of high&hyphen;speed aluminium boats. Australia is the world leader in this area. We had a third of the world's trade&mdash;the most expensive third. Tasmania has had some publicity in this regard, but by far the bulk of the industry is situated in Western Australia. It is interesting to note that a large customer is mainland China. They are so pleased with the service they get that they send the boats back to Western Australia to be refurbished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is simply ideological nonsense for the government to talk about removing the five per cent bounty. If you look at the world situation, Finland, which is our main competitor, has an 11 per cent bounty and shows no sign of reducing it. In fact, Europe has made it clear it will not reduce the bounty until the United States does. The United States has an open&hyphen; ended policy and shows no sign of reducing its bounty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Japan does not allow the entry of our vessels, even though they are very competi 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4311"> tive. They will buy the technology in an endeavour to try to replicate the efficiencies we have in Australia. Australian builders tell me they have no qualms in this regard because they say they are already moving ahead of their existing technology. It would be a crying shame if the blundering, ideological stupidity of this government saw the ships bounty phased out. Indeed, I have a philosophical view that you should support your successful industries, not penalise them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What other things can governments do? It is quite clear that the Australian government is by far the biggest single customer in Australia. In fact, it is true for any economy, whether it is Stalin's Russia or Reagan's America&mdash;the government is the biggest customer. And what the government does with that buying power has an enormous effect on industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If government purchases were bought on the through&hyphen;life cost of equipment rather than on the capital cost, Australian industry would shine. It would shine because parts made in Australia are invariably cheaper and more readily available. We are in the ludicrous position of having allowed our army to buy Mercedes Benz vehicles when Acco Inter vehicles were available. The army had worked with International for two years to develop the vehicle they wanted. We then let the army buy a foreign vehicle at a cost which was 50 per cent higher than that of the Australian vehicle. That was, I believe, the last nail in the coffin of International, which was surviving and profiting as a truck manufacturer in Australia, and could have continued to do so. Now, of course, it has simply gone. I think it is a tragedy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a consequence of that, we have Unimog, which has a torsion bar suspension. Australia was, and probably still is, a world leader in leaf spring suspensions. We still do not make torsion bars for the darned things. I know that a couple of years ago New South Wales railways, which had bought one of these things, had to wait six weeks to get a replacement part flown out from Germany. That is an example of the stupidity that we inflict on ourselves. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If government were to say to the Public Service&mdash;and remember that many purchases are made at a very low level in the Public Service&mdash;`You don't have to buy the Australian product but, if you don't buy it, we want you to put in writing why you haven't bought it,' assuming that one is available, this would have two benefits. You would find that a lot more Australian products would be bought. You would also find that where there were genuine flaws, they would be brought to somebody's attention and they would be fixed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just after we went down the Mercedes Benz road for our army, I visited France. I talked to people in the army there. I said, `You are part of Europe, you are very close to the Germans. Are you considering buying the Mercedes Benz, the Unimog?' The answer was, `Monsieur, we have very good French trucks. Why would we do anything like this?' I applaud the French position. I wish some of our governments could be bitten by Frenchmen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recall attending a pastoralists and graziers meeting and being regaled with the evils of tariffs and how tariffs were the bane of their lives. Of course, tariffs are not the bane of the rural sector. The real problem for the rural sector is access to long&hyphen;term finance and the fact that we deal almost exclusively for our major exports in corrupt markets. They put it to me at this meeting that tariffs were their major problem. I remember saying, `If we were to take tariffs off motorbikes tomorrow, how many of you would buy a new motorbike?' Apparently, they all would, because they all put their hands up to indicate that they would upgrade. I had pleasure in telling them that they could rush out and do so because there has never been a tariff on motorbikes in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That does not mean, however, that motorbikes are cheap. By world standards, they are not. A motorbike in Hong Kong, where there is a 25 per cent tariff, costs about the same as it does in Australia. The reason is that the Japanese are not stupid. They simply charge what the market will bear. I believe a tariff would not have a significant impact on the price of motorbikes. In any case, with the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4312"> advent of quite good bikes in China, competition would soon drive them down again if we were to source bikes from China. It would mean pastoralists would have to have a model which was a couple of years old, but I see that as no hardship whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just before the interruption to the debate a member was talking about ATSIC. It is true that the Liberal Party opposed the ATSIC legislation, and so did I. It was my opposition to it and the opposition of a few other members of the Labor Party to it that forced Gerry Hand to rewrite the legislation and get rid of some of the worst and most offending areas. However, I did not support the legislation in its final form and all the problems that were apparent then are now abundantly clear and with us. ATSIC has nothing to do with self-determination. In fact, it is quite the contrary. I know because I spend a lot of my time trying to protect Aboriginal people from the bureaucratic excesses of ATSIC. For many people self-determination is a myth. It is a myth which organisations such as ATSIC and the Aboriginal activists hide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You cannot separate the native title issue from the welfare of this nation and from the costs imposed on this nation. It is something that has to be considered in the budget context. It is my view that the Mabo decision was a social engineering decision. It was not based in law. I think the reason for that was that when we had appeals to the Privy Council there was some intellectual rigour imposed on the High Court. In those days, we arguably had the best appellate court in the world. Those days have gone. There is a no rigour imposed on the High Court and it has sunk into social engineering. In the Mabo report you have Deane and Gaudron talking about `our unspeakable shame'. What sort of emotive language is that? What sort of legal terminology is that? They on their high salaries, because they said they could see it, were absolved from any responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So that was forced on us. But the Keating government in its legislation went far beyond the original Mabo judgment, and the High Court has simply leapfrogged to catch up to be once more a leader, which, of course, is not the job of the High Court. We now have 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the absurdity of the judgment of Justice Kirby. That is something that Justice Kirby will have to live with, although I doubt whether it will ever give him any great concern, such is the nature of the man.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also true that Paul Keating believed absolutely that pastoral leases extinguish native title. Because Paul Keating believed this, every one of those so-called and self&hyphen;appointed Aboriginal leaders believed it because they were flocking around Keating like a swarm of worker bees. They believed therefore that it was gone. But the High Court's silly, stupid decision on Wik simply rekindled all their hopes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, Keating believed there was a prima facie case, but the act was such a mess that it was not in there and the Federal Court determined it was not. It is true that the act probably would not have been such a mess had the opposition and the mining industry made a contribution to the legislation. As it was, the ATSIC Act was written mainly by the left wing of the Labor Party. You get what you would expect from such a source. I think one of the great truths is the statement by Prescott, the Chairman of BHP, who described it as like reading porridge. That is probably the best description of the act I have heard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite clear that if nothing is done there is going to be rising insecurity and uncertainty in the mining industry. For a long time governments used to say, `It is not having an effect. Gold production is rising.' It was rising, but it was rising because gold production was invariably from brownfield sites. It was associated with existing mines and native title was not a consideration. That is changing. We are now moving to greenfield sites and native title is an enormous consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many leases in my electorate of Kalgoorlie where you have overlapping claims. There can be half a dozen or more claims on the one piece of land and that is unworkable. I believe that the government should have had the nerve in the early days to extinguish native title. They should have been prepared to have a double dissolution. I do not think they would have had to because the Labor Party are not entirely stupid and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4313"> they know that, had an election been held, they would have lost even more seats. The Liberal Party never had the nerve to do that. The reason is, as Senator Minchin succinctly put it, that they have as many bleeding hearts amongst their ranks as the Labor Party does.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be a cost from this and there will eventually be a reckoning. It is my view that we ought to have a referendum on the High Court decision. The question ought to be whether we return to terra nullius or stick with the nonsense which they have imposed on us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at the history of Britain, you find that their method of operation throughout the world was to sign treaties. The instruction was that people sign treaties with the natives. For that reason, New Zealand, Fiji, Malaysia, Ceylon, India and North America are covered in treaties&mdash;which have their own problems. The instructions to Captain Phillip were clear&mdash;to sign treaties with the natives. The reason he did not is that he could not. There was evolved the doctrine of terra nullius.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We on both sides of this parliament allowed Keating to carry on with the nonsense that he did: `Those unspeakable British, how arrogant to say there was no&hyphen;one here before them?' Terra nullius did not mean that at all. It meant basically no use of the land. High courts throughout the world&mdash;in Russia, Spain, Portugal, North America, Australia and Britain&mdash;had all held that occasional traversing of the land by nomadic people did not constitute use of the land. That is how terra nullius came about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were large parts of Australia where there was no Aboriginal habitation at all. The Nullarbor is one such place. There were no Aboriginals there because they could not exist. There was no surface water. On that vast limestone plateau rain sinks straight through. There was no way that anyone could survive out there unless they had the means to harness the underground water sources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I first went to the Nullarbor, there were no kangaroos for that very reason. Four years after putting down the bores, I could shoot 100 kangaroos a night. Immediately native title came in, my brother had two overlapping claims on his station&mdash;a station 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> where there was never, ever any Aboriginal occupation. Such is the nonsense that we have been faced with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is about time, as we have had conspicuous failure from government and opposition, that the people of Australia had the chance to put things right with a referendum. I think 30 years after the first referendum in 1967&mdash;which we are celebrating now&mdash;would be a good time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had a lot of talk in this parliament on that referendum. I voted in that referendum and I, like the vast majority of Australians, thought we were voting to give equality to Aboriginal people. Instead, we were not. We were voting to give special powers to the Commonwealth&mdash;powers which have largely been abused. I will be talking about this in the adjournment debate, so I do not want to go much further into that, except to say that there has to be a reckoning in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I represent more Aboriginal people than any other politician in this parliament, and I know what Aboriginal people are saying. They know that there is nothing for them in native title. They will be no better off. But they can see a backlash coming, and they know that they will be the recipients of the backlash. Many of those people who are now leading the charge will simply disappear. Many of them will become white again. I think it is a disgrace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also think it is a disgrace when you look at the part of the legal profession. I think particularly of activists like lawyer Ron Castan, who represented Aboriginals in the Mabo decision. He is a great champion of native title. One wonders whether Ron Castan et al had the same regard for Palestinian land rights, for people who were dispossessed in a much shorter time frame. But then that is the sort of tautology, the sort of hypocrisy, that the legal profession is so grounded in. I do not think they will have any trouble reconciling the irreconcilable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unless we get a return to our manufacturing industry, there are no jobs in the future and there is no end to the current account deficit. I can say here and now that this budget which has just been brought down by the government will not see a reduction in unemploy 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4314"> ment. The government is only hoping for a very small reduction&mdash;something in the order of 0.5 per cent. Remember, real unemployment in this country is far higher than 8.5 per cent, which is the official figure, and I can see nothing in this budget that is going to reduce that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can say here and now that at the time of the next election the current account deficit will be even higher. I am sure there will be some reason for this and it is all going to be addressed in the next budget. But the truth is that, unless there is a return to the manufacture industry, there are no jobs for our kids. This must be faced up to. This is not, as I say, I wild plea for tariffs. There are lots of other very sensible things that governments can do&mdash;things that do not offend GATT. We must begin by scrapping this rational economic nonsense of the level playing field, because I can say to members of this House that the level playing field is clearly a flat earth policy.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In a week notable for the fall of official interest rates by a further 0.5 per cent to 7.2 per cent, we should be cautious about any premature euphoria in housing purchases, for the brute facts, as revealed by the release of a report this week from the Real Estate Institute of Australia, show another picture. That report notes that historically the proportion of first home buyers in the housing market has been inversely proportional to mortgage interest rates. Rates come down and people make what is their major financial commitment for life to buy their homes. It has always been the Australian dream, and Paul Keating's attempts in the past to talk down the quarter acre block have not changed that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is different now is that the continuing falls in the interest rates over the past six months&mdash;which have taken almost $300 a month off the average $100,000 home mortgage since the coalition came to power&mdash;have not directly flowed through at this stage to home buyers coming into the market. Instead, as the REIA reports, first home ownership rates have declined. That is something which we must keep under scrutiny.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason for this is not hard to find. The REIA report states that real estate agents say that unemployment, combined with high job uncertainty, is the primary factor keeping many people out of the market. This problem is so serious that many more young people do not believe that owning their own home is a realisable goal. A couple of years ago, social researcher Jeanne Strachan concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Young couples today are the first generation since the war to face the reality that they often cannot obtain, even with two full-time workers in the house, what their parents saw as a fair and reasonable reward for their hard work.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The economic result is yet another disincentive to save and an increase in consumption which flows on into a rise in imports to this country and a worsening of Australia's national savings position and the current account deficit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason for this problem is obvious. The coalition government came to power on the back of the Labor government policies that created some of the highest levels of unemployment in this country since the Great Depression. We on this side of the House never envisaged that after 13 years of Labor it would be an easy problem to fix, and so it has proved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The trend unemployment rate increased from 8.4 per cent in December 1995 to 8.7 per cent in December 1996. The male unemployment rate rose by 0.1 per cent in the year to 8.9 per cent in December. The female unemployment rate fluctuated during the year from 7.9 per cent in December 1995 to 8.4 per cent in June 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of most concern are the long-term jobless figures. In trend terms, the number of long-term jobless fell from 233,100 in December 1995 to 212,100 in May 1996 before rising to 232,400 in December 1996. Long-term unemployment fell from 30.4 per cent of total unemployment in December 1995 to 29.2 per cent in December 1996. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, despite some fluctuations during the year, in trend terms, unemployment levels ended 1996 at a higher level in all states than 12 months earlier. Only 20.7 per cent of employers surveyed national 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4315"> ly were planning to increase their work forces in the three months to July.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet in a sense the reality behind the figures is worse than this. A 1995 Senate report found that Australia's unemployment rate was double the official rate. The difference between the official rate and the estimated real level of unemployment and underemployment was that the latter group included people who could not get work, those who were working one day a week but wanting more, and those who had simply given up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Several groups suffer disproportionately&mdash;the young, the old, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, people in some rural areas and outer suburbs, and many non-English speaking migrants. Professor Helen Hughes stated in 1995, `High overall unemployment, together with the lack of English, is creating high concentrations of poverty in migrant communities.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In July 1995, when the official unemployment rate for Australia was 8.4 per cent for males and 7.2 per cent for females, the rate for people born outside Australia from some countries was much higher&mdash;notably, North Africa, 22.7 per cent for males and 22.1 per cent for females; Lebanon, 29.8 per cent and 18.4 per cent; South-East Asia, 19.7 per cent and 13 per cent; and Vietnam in particular, 31 per cent and 25.4 per cent. I believe we need to keep those figures uppermost in our mind. The government has acted on this knowledge in the reduction in the number of migrants to this country and in the new focus on migrants with skills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor government in almost a decade and a half presided over the increasing casualisation of the Australian work force. By 1995, 6.5 million workers in Australia were casual workers. Casual workers lack the benefits of service enjoyed by the rest of the working population and are subject to even greater uncertainty in the continuation of their employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor government also presided over an increasing polarisation between higher and lower level workers as the proportion of middle income earners slumped and the pay rates of senior executives increased by nearly 60 per cent to 1995. According to the Prices 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Surveillance Authority, senior executives have been drawing salary rises 1.5 times larger than the average full-time employee's and more than double the rises won by workers whose wages are restricted to award rates of pay&mdash;and this is under a supposedly Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is time, I believe, for us to renew our aspiration for full employment. The 1945 white paper entitled boldly <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Full employment in Australia</EMPHASIS> stated: `Full employment is a fundamental aim of the Commonwealth government.' Unlike the former Labor government, which made fiddling the unemployment figures into an art form, churning the long-term unemployed through so-called employment programs that eventually returned many people to the ranks of the unemployed no more employable but registered as newly unemployed, the Commonwealth government in 1945 dedicated itself to stimulating real employment. Its manifesto asserted: `There will be no place in this full employment policy for schemes designed to make work for work's sake.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government in 1945 prefaced its policy for full employment on the dire period between 1919 and 1939, when more than one-tenth of the population desiring work were unemployed in this nation. At the nadir of the Great Depression, well over 25 per cent of the country's work force could not obtain work. The solution then was Keynesian. The government spent on public works to stimulate private investment. The attraction of private investment was seen as paramount. The white paper explained:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A major cause of decreases in private capital expenditure in the past has been the tendency of many businessmen, farmers and other investors simultaneously to contract their capital expenditure because of the fear of a reduction in spending. This was inevitable in an economy in which total expenditure was expected to fluctuate, and in which businessmen were extremely sensitive to their rivals' and associates' estimates of movements in spending in the near future. Simply because businessmen tended simultaneously to contract their capital expenditure, they contributed significantly by their very actions to the fall in total spending which they feared. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4316"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So the government determined to keep Commonwealth spending at a high and reasonably constant level as a consequence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government of 1945 totally rejected the claim that occasional depressions are necessary to remove inefficient firms and to speed up the transfer of resources from declining to expanding industries, which it maintained `cannot any longer be supported in view of the miseries imposed on large sections of the community by those depressions'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rereading the white paper of 1945, it becomes apparent how the perceived role of government in this country has changed. In 1945 it was possible to put in place import quotas when there was a severe and prolonged fall in export incomes. For less permanent declines in Australia's trading fortunes overseas, an alteration in the exchange rate was seen as the appropriate method of correction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some commentators have dated the abandonment of the aspirations of the 1945 white paper to the Fraser government's election in 1975. Then the government chose to fight inflation first rather than deal with the high rates of unemployment as a priority. The emphasis was on keeping money supply steady. Policy makers from that era onwards returned to the classical view of unemployment as purely the result of excessive real wage levels, which had risen dramatically prior to 1975 under the Whitlam government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These policies largely excluded the possibility of active government intervention to achieve full employment. However, an adverse consequence of these decisions was to expose Australia to the ill winds that blow from offshore. Economic policy became a matter of anticipating the reactions of the markets. So the values of the foreign exchange market speculators came to dominate economic policy. As we saw in the 1980s, a wave of unproductive speculative activity was unleashed in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As most monetary levers had been given away by government, it was left to curb high inflation with the bluntest of blunt instruments, high interest rates, which sent many small businesses to the wall, never to return. At every point the judgment seems to have been wrong. Mr Keating variously told the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australian people that the recession was the recession that we had to have and that there would be a soft landing. He never did bring home the bacon as promised and the Labor Party is now in limbo because of this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A worrying concern for many Australians is their perception that these trends of globalisation have removed full employment from the national agenda. The truism is that by being competitive in a survival of the fittest contest the most efficient companies will survive and it will not matter that the rest will not. The phoenix will rise again from the ashes in the form of new businesses and industries. Many Australian manufacturers find that to compete with the low levels of pay possible in industries in South&hyphen;East Asia, for example, they have to increasingly `downsize'&mdash;that euphemism from the 1980s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The litmus test for the Australian economy is the development of high value added industries and exports, particularly in areas such as elaborately transformed manufactures, ETMs. In the late 1980s it seemed as if giant strides were being made in this country in ETMs. In 1985 ETMs and other manufactures accounted for 20 per cent of total commodity exports. By 1993 this position had improved to a point where ETMs and other manufactures accounted for almost 30 per cent of total commodity exports. Even the ratio of exports to imports slowly improved for ETMs and manufactures as a whole. In 1986 ETM exports were 15 per cent of total ETM trade while by 1993 exports had moved up to 35 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other half of the equation, however, was that imports so far exceeded exports that, according to Stephen Bell in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Journal of Australian Political Economy</EMPHASIS> last year, the relative growth rates of the 1980s would have to have been maintained for several decades to bring any marked improvement in net trade outcomes. That is the position we find ourselves in at this particular time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Moreover, the trend towards a deteriorating trade balance in manufactures has been accompanied by a fall&hyphen;off in investment in import competing industries. The problem is compounded because whenever the economy 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4317"> starts to pick up so does our buying of imports and the current account deteriorates further.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The manufacturing sector is thus peculiarly vulnerable to the imports assault. Bell points out that the import penetration of manufactures increased by almost 50 per cent between 1970 and 1989. This figure is even way above the OECD average&mdash;in fact, 24 per cent higher than the OECD average. Many imports no longer compete with any local products. Worse, the ETM trade deficit worsened from $20 billion in 1985 to almost $37 billion by 1994. Amongst the imports there is only little evidence of the capital goods component that is necessary to rebuild industry. The conclusion that Bell and other commentators have drawn is that Australia is actually becoming more, not less, dependent on non-manufactured, largely low value&hyphen;added exports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor failed to develop an industry policy except on an ad hoc basis for the industrial basket cases. Yet I believe industry policy can be the means for reducing the extent to which adverse economic outcomes are determined by international market forces. Its value is in ensuring the development of a diversified national economy at least partially insulated from the fluctuations in price and demand in world markets. Despite its bleating in recent weeks, the previous government failed to develop an adequate industry policy. The ongoing problem for national economies is to wind up old industries and structurally realign others and to adopt new technologies and retrain the labour force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Industry policy requires the support of the state apparatus to identify trends and opportunities. The success of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, known as MITI, in Japan shows the advantages to be gained from a national approach to industry policy formulation and implementation. We have only to look to the Asian tigers to see the benefits of such an approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">MITI is quite small and its personnel are recruited from the brightest and best graduates of the best universities in Japan. The funds it controls are small, about one per cent of government department outlays. Its influence is not in granting large sums to industry. The 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> US grants three times as much, for example, by way of research and development. Industry policy, as practised by MITI, is therefore a government strategy to help important business sectors. This is not a call in any way for a return to the inefficiencies of protectionism that we have had in this country in the past. It is more future oriented and, unlike the industry policy<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">practised in Europe, not so hog-bound by short-term political interests. Japanese industry policy is inherently discriminatory, but of sectors rather than of individual companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An important function of Japanese industry policy is to facilitate structural adjustment, helping some industries to grow and others to wind down in a more orderly fashion. It is described as `market conforming', anticipating where markets will be and speeding up adjustments to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Howard government has acted to free up the bureaucratic restrictions on small business, to get rid of industrial employment laws that act as a disincentive to employment and to abandon the many mickey mouse training programs that have been in existence over the last decade. This budget, in continuing the policy to replace the Commonwealth's $10 billion deficit with a surplus by the end of the Howard government's first term, is an important step towards the improvement of national savings, but much remains to be done. We have only started on what is a long road, given the history of what has happened over the last decade or more in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I would like to urge is that there must be a national objective, namely, full employment, and that every government program should be tested against whether it is going to achieve that end. The previous government failed this test. It is in the interests of Australia, of all Australians today and of Australians in the future that we cannot afford to fail this test also.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, in speaking on this appropriation bill, I commend the budget to the House. I believe the steps taken in it, particularly in relation to national savings, are important steps because if the Commonwealth itself can bring its deficit under control and create a surplus it will be making an important step in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4318"> terms of the long&hyphen;term future of Australia. That step is not simply in relation to what the Commonwealth achieves itself but to the signals it sends to the Australian people and the encouragement it gives to them to practise national savings on a scale that is so necessary for the future for this country.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make three basic points about the budget. Firstly, it reveals the unambiguous failure of last year's budget to deliver on its economic forecasts. Secondly, it demonstrates, by breaching two key front&hyphen;and&hyphen;centre election promises, the utter deception of the Australian people by the coalition at the last election. Thirdly, it fails absolutely to deliver on the major claim that the government is making for this budget, which is that it increases savings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Expanding on those points, let me say firstly that in last year's budget the government claimed that, despite the contractionary budgetary policies that it was pursuing, it would still achieve substantial economic growth and enough employment growth to reduce unemployment. We argued that, because of the contractionary impact of the budget, the economy would be slowed and unemployment would be likely to be increased. This budget confirms that we were right and the government was wrong. Economic growth and employment growth were both notably less than forecast and unemployment increased, not decreased&mdash;at least that is the expectation of the government as revealed in this year's budget for this current financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the details. In last year's budget, they forecast that for 1996&hyphen;97 we would have growth of real GDP of 3&half; per cent. This budget says it will only be 3&frac14; per cent. They said we would have employment growth of 1&half; per cent. This budget says it will be 1&frac14; per cent. They said we would have an unemployment rate in the June quarter of 8&frac14; per cent. This budget says it will be 8&frac34; per cent. Quite clearly, there has been a failure to deliver on the forecasts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That failure is what we predicted but also, importantly, we should remember that these forecasts were indeed modest. They were less 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> than Labor had been achieving when it was in office. We had been achieving for the previous three years rates of growth of output of over four per cent a year. Employment had been increasing at an average of 2.8 per cent per annum over the previous three years. We had a forecast here for a lousy 1&half; per cent, and they could not even achieve that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Against these outcomes, the Howard government's economic growth and employment forecasts obviously have not been achieved. Even though they were very modest forecasts, it still failed to deliver on them, the result being that we have got an unemployment rate forecast for the end of this financial year&mdash;for the June quarter of 1997&mdash;which is higher than for the June quarter of 1996 and, indeed, higher than for the June quarter of 1995. There can be no doubt that this budget reveals that the government's key economic forecasts in last year's budget were not obtained, and that the opposition's contention&mdash;that the contractionary Costello budget would slow growth and increase unemployment&mdash;has been shown to be correct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second major point I want to make is that this budget, by breaking two key front&hyphen;and&hyphen;centre election promises, reveals the coalition's deception of people at the last election. The first one was the promise to boost employment growth. The now Prime Minister (Mr Howard) promised in his policy launch statement on 18 February 1996 to boost job growth. There was no more central promise he made than that&mdash;to boost job growth. To this point in time, we have seen an abysmal failure by the government to deliver on that election promise, and this budget confirms that there is no possibility of this government anywhere near matching Labor's employment growth, let alone boosting growth higher than that level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Compare the record of the two governments to this point in time. This government has been in office 14 months. In that first 14 months, it has achieved employment growth of 92,000&mdash;1.1 per cent. In Labor's last 14 months, employment grew by 263,000 compared with a lousy 92,000 under this government. Our growth: 3.3 per cent compared with their 1.1 per cent. In Labor's last 14 months, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4319"> we had growth in full&hyphen;time employment of 192,000. This government has achieved just 4,000. In male full&hyphen;time employment, we had growth of 114,000. This government has reduced male full&hyphen;time employment by 16,000 in its first 14 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The number of unemployed in our last 14 months decreased by 26,000. Under this government, it has gone up by 35,000. The unemployment rate went down in our last 14 months by 0.6 per cent, from nine per cent to 8.4 per cent. Under this government, it has gone up to 8.7 per cent. The number of long&hyphen;term unemployed went down by 56,000 in our last 14 months. In this government's first 14 months, it has gone up 14,000. The teenage unemployment rate went down by 0.7 per cent in our last 14 months. It went up by 1.5 per cent in this government's first 14 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What all these figures show is that, far from boosting employment as promised, this government has boosted unemployment. Furthermore, this budget demonstrates that there is no chance whatever that the government will be able to meet its election promise in this term of office. Labor, in its last term of office, increased employment by 733,000 or 9.65 per cent. That is what the Prime Minister promised to beat: he would boost employment growth. He would do better than Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So far, in its first 14 months, this government has achieved only 92,000 additional jobs. So it has got 641,000 additional jobs to create in the next 22 months just to match Labor's additional jobs, and if it wants to match Labor's rate of employment growth&mdash;that is, the 9.65 per cent&mdash;it would need to create an additional 712,000 jobs in the next 22 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget demonstrates that the government has no hope whatever of matching Labor's employment growth, let alone surpassing it. Its employment forecasts are for 2&frac14; per cent employment growth in 1997&hyphen;98 and again in 1998&hyphen;99. Assuming that these forecast increases were actually achieved and assuming that the rate of growth would commence from now and not July, then in 22 months time&mdash;that is, in February 1999&mdash;they would have increased employment by a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> further 351,000. With the 92,000 they have achieved so far, this would mean an increase in employment in this term of office for the Howard government of 443,000 or 5.3 per cent. That 443,000 is 290,000 fewer than Labor achieved in its last term of office. So this government is on track to achieve an employment outcome of 290,000 fewer jobs than were created in Labor's last term of office. Some terrific achievement that is going to be when you finally roll up to the election in February or March&mdash;whenever it is&mdash;of 1999 and say, `Look at our great achievement. We have increased employment by 443,000, just 290,000 fewer than Labor.' What a pathetic performance that will be! But that is what this government is on track to achieve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even if they did a little better than they have forecast, which is highly unlikely given their record, they would still be way behind Labor's achievement. And if they were to match our rate of growth&mdash;9.65 per cent&mdash;they would need 360,000 more jobs than they are on track to achieve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is falling lamentably short of its promise to boost employment growth. It has, in a major way, decreased employment growth and shows no signs of turning that around. So it is now quite official: this government's most fundamental and central election promise&mdash;to boost jobs growth&mdash;has been abandoned after only 14 months in office. The budget in fact is a surrender document on employment. It is a total admission of failure to anywhere near matching Labor's employment growth, let alone surpassing it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As realisation of the crushing failure to match Labor is hitting home, we are seeing the government turn to distractions and excuses. They are turning to things like work for the dole&mdash;a parody of their promise to create real jobs&mdash;and to excuses like the unfair dismissals legislation. If only we would agree to amend it one more time, that would enable them to create some jobs, ignoring the fact that in the year after the unfair dismissals legislation was introduced by the Labor government&mdash;in March of 1994&mdash;employment grew by 327,000! It did not stop us creating 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4320"> an awful lot of jobs, so don't rely on that excuse either.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will turn now to the second breach of election promise, and that is the coalition's promise at the last election to meet the then government's co&hyphen;contribution commitment. That commitment was to match employees' contributions to superannuation dollar for dollar up to three per cent of average weekly earnings and, subject to an income test, that would phase the contribution out altogether at twice average weekly earnings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The now government promised at the last election, unambiguously, to match that&mdash;to introduce the co-contribution&mdash;and it has clearly not done that as shown by what is in this budget. This was a $4 billion promise, but it was not some minor promise. This was a promise to pay $4 billion per annum when the thing was fully phased in to the working people of Australia&mdash;not just to the wage and salary earners but to the self&hyphen;employed as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was the largest promise that the coalition made and it was worth substantial money to working men and women. For instance, a worker on average weekly earnings would have been required to contribute three per cent of his pay to his superannuation fund and would have received from the government a matching $1,000 into his superannuation fund. So he put in $1,000 and he got a $1,000 matching payment from the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this budget the promise by the coalition to pay that money is abandoned. Instead, there is a different savings scheme, which costs only half as much as the co&hyphen;contribution when fully introduced&mdash;that is, $2 billion compared with $4 billion&mdash;and which pays a 15 per cent rebate on superannuation contributions up to $3,000 per annum or savings investment income of up to that amount without any means test.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For ordinary workers, this is daylight robbery. The scheme robs them of $2 billion a year in overall funding of the scheme. Secondly, by paying only a 15 per cent rebate instead of dollar for dollar, it robs them of much more than half the original benefit. For instance, for that worker who put $1,000 into his superannuation, he now gets a 15 per cent 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> rebate, which pays him $150 compared with the $1,000 he was going to get under the co&hyphen;contribution approach, which we promised to introduce and which the coalition promised to introduce as well. The coalition is now welshing on that promise and robbing this worker of $850 per annum. It is not some minor breach. This is probably the most outrageous breach of election promise that has ever been perpetrated in this country. I cannot remember a $2 billion breach of promise before. That is what this is. In fact, for the workers involved, it is much more than halving it; it is almost taking most of the benefit away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">High income earners, who would have been means tested out of the co&hyphen;contribution scheme, can now receive the maximum benefit under this new scheme of $450. An executive on three times the average weekly earnings would have got nothing from the co&hyphen;contribution because of the means test, but now that there is no means test he picks up the full $450 while the worker gets screwed for $850. What is being perpetrated on the workers of this country is an outrage. The whole thing is being distorted in so far as it takes away from them anything that does exist and gives it to the higher income earners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is made more so by a wider range of investment income qualifying for the rebate. So it includes interest, dividends, rental income, trust income&mdash;you can split your income in lots of ways through various trusts; they all pick up the $450&mdash;partnership income other than wages and salaries, capital gains, et cetera. The recipients of this type of income will be very largely higher income people. Much of the benefit of the scheme that is now being introduced will go to people whose incomes are well above the cut-off point that would have applied in the co-contribution scheme. So it is biased heavily towards the wealthy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition promise to the workers of this country that they would pay them $4 billion a year has been totally comprehensively and shamefully abandoned. Instead, they have offered a few peanuts while the wealthy receive bagfuls of macadamias. Those battlers who voted for the coalition, believing their interests would be protected, have every right 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4321"> to be utterly outraged by this government's action in cynically deceiving them into thinking it would pay them what Labor had promised and then ripping them off comprehensively.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget fails absolutely to deliver on what it claims to be the central feature of this budget&mdash;a boost to savings. This failure to boost national savings stems from two factors. Firstly, the government's failure to cover its new expenditure with sufficient expenditure decreases or tax increases to provide a boost to national savings; instead, it reduces national savings. Secondly, the government's abandonment of the previous government's policy to boost private savings and replace it with a much less effective alternative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me go to the first of those two points. The government claims that its budget measures result in increased national savings but this is not so for the years beyond 1997-98. This is because the major expenditure reduction contained in the budget is the scrapping of the proposed co-contribution for employee superannuation contributions, which was to be phased in from 1998-99. But scrapping that co-contribution does not increase national saving.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To the extent that it is not spent on new measures, it increases public saving but it does not increase national saving because this payment was already going to be totally saved in private savings. Robbing private savings to increase public savings does not increase national savings. This is especially so when, as is the case in this budget, some of these purloined private savings are spent by the government when they are brought into the public sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leaving aside the abandonment of the co-contribution payment, for the years 1998-99, 1999-2000 and 2000-01 the government's budget balance expansion measures&mdash;that is, new expenditure measures and revenue reduction measures&mdash;exceed the budget balance reduction measures, that is, the expenditure reduction and revenue increasing measures. It exceeds them by $197 million in 1998-99, by $1,755 million in 1999-2000 and by $2,887 million in 2000-01.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The effect of this budget in those three years is to reduce national savings. The budget shows an increase in public savings but only by stealing from what was earmarked as private savings&mdash;that is, the co-contribution. The government will spend some of those earmarked savings, resulting in a reduction in total national savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second reason for reduced national savings is, as I said, the abandonment of the previous government's policy to boost private savings through superannuation and to replace it with a less effective alternative. Labor's scheme had award superannuation, the superannuation guarantee and then the compulsory employee contributions and the government co-contribution. According to the retirement income modelling task force, the effect of this scheme on national savings was to increase it by 2.5 per cent of GDP by 2001-02 and by 4.2 per cent of GDP by 2020.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this government has done is maintained the award superannuation guarantee reluctantly, scrapped the rest of it, brought in the rebate scheme and made some changes to superannuation arrangements. The combined effect of the government's new package, according to the budget statement <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Savings: choice and incentive</EMPHASIS>, is said to be that national savings will be increased by 1.5 per cent of GDP by 2001-02. That is compared with Labor's 2.5 per cent&mdash;1.1 per cent of GDP less saving. By the year 2020 it will have a 3.6 per cent increase in saving compared to Labor's 4.2. This is a policy to reduce national savings over what they would have been if they had stuck with Labor's policy, as they promised to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the most extraordinary situation. You have a government breaking an absolutely central major election promise and then saying, `Having broken that we are going to boost national savings.' But what they are doing is reducing savings and they are admitting it in the document <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Savings:  choice and incentive</EMPHASIS>. It is all in there. The overall effect of it is to get a less savings boost than you would have got from Labor's program. This is a government that is reducing national savings. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4322">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We get no figure in there for what this rebate scheme is going to do because everyone knows this rebate scheme is a farce in terms of increasing savings. There is no estimate in there for that one alone. Treasury has said in reviewing the OECD report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Taxation and household savings</EMPHASIS>, which came out in November 1994, that there was no likelihood of increased savings. That OECD report said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Treasury finds no clear evidence that cutting taxes on investment income leads to increased saving either by the household sector in isolation or at the level of the national economy after taking into account the effect of the revenue cost of tax breaks.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is how Treasury summarised it in its <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economic Roundup</EMPHASIS>  of summer 1995. Treasury said to this government that these schemes will not work. They have gone ahead with it anyway. They cannot publish a savings boost in their document because they know there isn't any. In fact, most likely it is going to reduce savings. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my electorate of Murray I had decent young men wanting real work, wanting training to get that real work, put in the back of utes and trucks and driven out to forests under LEAP schemes&mdash;and God knows what else they were called at the time&mdash;supposedly to be trained as forestry type workers. In fact, they were to dig and install cattle grids, only one per day, and there were seven or eight people there to do it. They were not supervised. They did not get information or training on how to install cattle grids, not that that is a very long-term job prospect anyway. All they got was colds. They went back sick. Unfortunately, that is what Labor did to young people who genuinely wanted to work and who wanted to have access to training. I notice that the member for Gellibrand is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> leaving the chamber. I do not doubt for a minute that he would want to stay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure that too many people remember what they did in the previous 13 years with our unemployed: they failed to give them genuine work opportunities. What happened is that the books were cooked. There was more frantic book cooking as the election approached in 1996. More of these mickey mouse schemes were brought on. More of the people from the jobless queues were siphoned off into numerous programs and then called trainees, so the statistics looked better. But the outcomes for those people were just the same. It was a cruel and callous thing to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You were defeated at the last election because the country wants jobs for its people. We do not pretend for a moment that the work for the dole scheme is anything to do with creating work for young people that will be ongoing. What we talk about with work for the dole is giving young people in particular an experience of what it is like to contribute back to the communities that are, through their taxes, paying for their unemployment entitlements. We are giving young people a sense of what it is like to meet with others, to get back into the routine of work and to, perhaps, experience work for the first time. We are calling it work for the dole, and that is what the public wants to call it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are so many communities and non-profit organisations out there waiting to take up these younger unemployed people to give them that chance. But we are not pretending for a minute that that is how we are going to lower the unemployment statistics in this country. We are not callous and we will not pretend like Labor did for 13 years. So let us put that on the record and straighten it all up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me talk about what our budget does. We now, as a nation, understand what it is like to be on the rollercoasters of massive bust and boom inflationary spirals that go up and down and eat into people's savings so that there is no sense of stability over time. What we have done in this budget is consolidate the principles established in our first year when we responded to the calls of the people and determined that Australia would once again be a nation that pays its own way. We 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4323"> committed ourselves to creating an economic environment of decades of low interest rates for people to borrow to build their homes and businesses and low inflation rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year's budget was tough, but in every way it was widely regarded as fair. We took a scalpel to government expenditure. We delivered substantial cuts, but we retained essential services, and we were fair. This year we have continued to deliver, particularly in ways that address some of the fundamental inequalities in Australian society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I represent a rural community. For the 13 years of Labor, rural communities understood that they were out of sight and out of mind. The standards of the physical and social infrastructure in rural areas were run&hyphen;down. The inequalities in access to health services for country people really could not and cannot be tolerated any further. The unequal outcomes when it comes to access to higher education for rural people when compared to urban counterparts cannot continue to be tolerated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also talking about the provision of services that are essential to ensure that we can compete in the cutthroat world of international agribusiness trade, which is of course a building block of all regional communities. We must have world best quarantine services, world best anti-dumping authorities that work and basic research capabilities or we cannot continue to compete in the highly competitive international agribusiness arenas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous government ignored rural communities. Rural communities overwhelmingly reject Labor governments at each election, and the last election was no different. However, this government understands that Australians regard fair play and equality of opportunity as necessary for maximising people's independence and ensuring that they have a quality of life that is at least as good as, if not better than, that of the earlier generations. To do that, they need to have a sound economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us begin with the provision of health services and what this government, through this last budget and the budget before, has provided to ensure that an electorate like Murray does not fall further behind in offer 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ing basic health services to the newborn, children, adults and the elderly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There seems to be some 4,000 too many doctors in Australian cities, but there are some 500 too few in country areas. In the country, as compared with the city, the chance of dying of heart disease is 18 per cent higher, the chance of dying of a stroke is 29 per cent higher and the chance of dying of pneumonia or influenza is at least 80 per cent higher. Death from respiratory diseases and its causes is 71 per cent higher and death from genito&hyphen;urinary causes is 86 per cent higher. Rural children are more prone to ailments, with a death rate, for example, among girls some 15 per cent higher than for girls in the city. Of course we all know about the sad facts of rural youth suicide rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Only yesterday I was very proud to announce that this government in this last budget has created six new departments of rural health that are to be distributed around Australia. In the Goulburn Valley, in the heart of the Murray electorate, we will see one of those departments of rural health established. Some $500,000 is to be expended in this financial year, with a further $1.5 million in the next and following financial years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This new initiative will ensure that some of these metropolitan doctors will come and train in rural areas. They will experience rural life; they will train to deal with the different health issues that socioeconomic groups in country areas present with. We hope that when they come to train in Shepparton they will find that not only is their career prospect enhanced if they choose to stay in rural areas but so is their quality of life. This is an initiative that has been identified already throughout Australia as likely to make a substantial impact in future years.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the report by Sir 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4324"> Ronald Wilson, as this is the first opportunity I have had to do so. My starting point for deliberation of this report is that the author tells us that it is not an `intellectual document'; it is `from the heart'. What this means, of course, is that the report is not constrained by fact or by evidence. In passing, it must be said that such a base is not an appropriate methodology for any government consideration or the running of a country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report is also greatly flawed in other ways. For instance, Ronald Wilson seems mainly to have interviewed the clients who were sent to him by the Aboriginal Legal Service, and he has made no attempt to interview those people who refused to testify because they knew that in their case it was the act of being taken away that saved their lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is always easy on an issue such as this to trot out the highly emotional examples, as the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans) did in his predictably sanctimonious contribution. I remember the recent words of</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Isobel Lynnot who is now 95&hyphen;years&hyphen;old. She, along with her sister, were the first children to be taken to Beagle Bay, a Catholic mission, in 1909. Isobel's father was white and, when he died, her mother implored the local police officer to take her children as they would `otherwise surely die'. Isobel remembers Beagle Bay very warmly. `The nuns were very good to us,' she said. `They gave us clean clothes, taught us to read and write and to play musical instruments. They taught us to sew and to dance.' She has only gratitude for her deliverance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another hero of mine is Pearl Hamaguchi, a woman who, being an Aboriginal Asian, endured a far harder life than that of white half&hyphen;caste children. Pearl remembers all that she endured&mdash;but she does not dwell on it. She has made a name for herself. She, her Japanese husband and her family are highly regarded in Broome where they live. I think it is very, very important that people understand this: here is a person who knew and endured all those things, and triumphed. I know many cases where people have triumphed over disability, and I think theirs is just such testimony. I must say that Pearl 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Hamaguchi is a woman whom I admire greatly. Her example is one for the whole of society. She is a role model for all, not just for Aboriginal people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must take issue with the Governor-General. The Governor-General in the Mabo report spoke of our `unutterable shame'&mdash;not a legal term, but certainly words he could recognise as being ones from which he could dissociate himself. The recent apology given by Holy Billy I think was highly inappropriate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to condemn the actions of Telstra in seeking to ram through a proposal to deploy aerial broadband communications cable in Mornington and Mount Eliza, just weeks before the controls on cable deployment are substantially upgraded. Some of the 3,800 affected households in Mornington and Mount Eliza learnt just over a week ago that Telstra intended to commence the deployment of broadband cabling in the dying days of the revised telecommunications national code. Telstra plans to aerially deploy its cabling in 88 per cent of the Mount Eliza neighbourhoods and 75 per cent of the Mornington area covered by this ill&hyphen;conceived proposal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With a mere few days notice, a public meeting was held on 21 May 1997 to inform residents from Mount Eliza and Mornington of Telstra's plans. An almost unanimous motion from the meeting called on Telstra to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4325"> defer its activities until after June 30 to enable proper consultation to take place with the local community and the Mornington Peninsular Shire Council. At the information meeting, Telstra representatives were unable to provide costings on undergrounding alternatives, or to discuss cooperative proposals to reduce the impact of cabling on neighbourhood amenity as has been negotiated between the City of Booroondara and Optus. Not only is Telstra failing to comply with the provisions of the revised code, it is behaving as if `telco thuggery' is a way of enhancing consumer loyalty. Here is why.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both Telstra and Optus advised me that they only had cabling plans for the Frankston city area and not into the Mornington Peninsular Shire area during round table discussions held on 24 and 30 September last year. Telstra spoke in terms of `keeping pace with its competitor' which involved expected work in the Frankston area this year. Optus has carried through this position. Telstra now claims that `competitive pressures' are behind its plans to go south of the Frankston city area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I reject Telstra's argument of so-called competitive pressures as Optus is not in the area concerned, households already have telephony services, pay TV is available through other delivery systems, and current Telstra technology provides access to available on&hyphen;line services. The Telstra representatives may have let out of the bag the real source of pressure to deploy the cable when advising the public meeting at Mornington that `Telstra has a business obligation to Foxtel to roll out'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For Mornington residents, Telstra appears to want to impose on them metropolitan technology, deployed with inner city sensitivity, while denying Mornington people access to metropolitan prices because the area concerned is outside the Melbourne 039 call zone. A reasonable opportunity has not been provided for the community to work through Telstra's proposals and certainly not to engage in the sort of substantive dialogue provided for by the post&hyphen;July 1 regulatory regime. No-one wants to deny the local community new technology. But there is no 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> good reason for Telstra's indecent haste to avoid genuine consultation with the neighbourhoods concerned and the local council.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra's activities are opportunistic. Telstra knows that the code it is trying to exploit would not still exist if the previous Labor government had not locked in the code until 30 June this year as part of the licence deal with Optus. Telstra is being heavy-handed in using this small window of opportunity to roll out aerial cable in Mornington and Mount Eliza.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been told by Telstra that `commercial concerns' mean that a delay is not on. Genuine consultation and dialogue with the local communities is being denied. A thoughtful and customer focused Telstra would provide a proper opportunity for the local community to work through its plans and to fully explore deployment alternatives in conjunction with the local council.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no good reason why the people I represent in Mornington and Mount Eliza should be denied this opportunity. Working through Telstra's plans without the immunity carriers have from state and planning environment laws would ensure that the proper consultation and dialogue occurs between the Mornington Peninsula Shire Council, Telstra and its Mornington and Mount Eliza customers. I call on Telstra to be more reasonable in its behaviour towards Mornington and Mount Eliza residents in regard to its deployment of broadband cabling.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="4325"><TITLE><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bringing Them Home</EMPHASIS></TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise following the contribution of the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) at this stage more in sorrow than in anger that a representative of the Australian people could be so unfeeling in the way in which he has responded to the report produced by Sir Ronald Wilson. To suggest that the report is not supported by fact and evidence is clearly sheer nonsense.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Speaker, lest it be thought that we are talking about times long in the past or times long distant, let me refer to a few of the cases that are produced as evidence in the report that come from your and my home state of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4326"> Victoria. In fact, some of them come from the leafy suburbs of Balwyn, Blackburn South and Kew. The case of Paul, in confidential submission 133, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was born in May 1964. My Mother and I lived together within an inner suburb of Melbourne. At the age of five and a half months, both my Mother and I became ill. My Mother took me to the Royal Children's Hospital, where I was admitted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Upon my recovery, the Social Welfare Department . . . persuaded my Mother to board me into St Gabriel's Babies' Home in Balwyn . . . just until Mum regained her health. If only Mum could've known the secret, deceitful agenda of the State welfare system that was about to be put into motion&mdash;18 years of forced separation between a loving mother and her son.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is a very recent situation, Mr Speaker, I am sure you would agree, dealing with very familiar surroundings to you and me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Confidential evidence 139, Victoria, tells of a person removed in 1967. The witness's mother died shortly after being reunited. The witness states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When I first met my mother&mdash;when I was 14&mdash;she wasn't what they said she was. They made her sound like she was stupid, you know, they made her sound so bad. And when I saw her she was so beautiful. Mum said, `My baby's been crying' and she walked into the room and . . . my mother and we hugged . . . That was my first feeling of love . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Confidential evidence 139, Victoria, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I got told my Aboriginality when I got whipped and they'd say, `You Abo, you nigger'. This was the only time I got told my Aboriginality.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Confidential evidence 163, Victoria, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And for them to say she [mother] neglected us! I was neglected when I was in this government joint down here. I didn't end up 15 days in a hospital bed [with bronchitis] when I was with me mum and dad.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Confidential evidence 214, Victoria, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I ran away because my foster father used to tamper with me and I'd just had enough. I went to the police but they didn't believe me. So she [foster mother] just thought I was a wild child and she put me in one of those hostels and none of them believed me&mdash;I was the liar. So I've never talked about it to anyone. I don't go about telling lies, especially big lies like that.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe this report to parliament ought to be dealt with against that background. It is an emotional debate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this debate tonight to acknowledge and bring to the attention of the parliament the extraordinary efforts of 14 young women in my electorate. Young people are the subject of much debate in this House, as well they should be: they are our most precious, valuable resource as a nation. Unfortunately, the media in this country very often focus on negative stories about today's youth rather than the many positive achievements that our young people are making today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This fuels the misconception in some parts of the community that today's generation are lazy, uncooperative or just do not care about the communities in which they live. Nothing could be further from the truth, especially for the 14 young women I was pleased to meet last Saturday night.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the past four months, these 14 young achievers aged between 17 and 22 have worked tirelessly to raise more than $45,000 for local charities as part of the Beenleigh Cane Festival&mdash;$45,000 in just four months is an incredible achievement in anyone's measures. It is a lot of raffle tickets and a lot of car washing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to be able to recognise their achievements in this place and would like to make special mention of each of these young people: Victoria Senden, Judith Andrews, Rita Brehmer, Faith Williams, Rebecca Engwicht, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4327"> Nicole Lloyd, Karyn Oleinik, Diana Dewey, Michell Game, Dani&hyphen;Lee Menzies, Tonya Gilbert, Sharyn Burns, Anita Blackmur, who was awarded the festival title for her hard work, and Nicole Newberry, who was the top fund&hyphen;raiser. She deserves special congratulations for her remarkable effort.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Beenleigh Cane Festival is truly a community based event with 15,000 people in attendance at the parade. These young women give a great deal of themselves to help promote our local area. They are a credit to themselves and a heartening example of the next generation for all of us. I would also like to mention the cane quest coordinator, Mrs Anne Hackwood, who helped these young people to achieve their goals. She gives tirelessly of herself to make the event a success each year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most important point is that the local Police Citizens Youth Club, Rural Fire Brigade, Blue Nurses and the Air/Sea Rescue will be the beneficiaries of the girls' efforts. Which really means that the whole community are the beneficiaries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On behalf of local residents I thank these young people for their time, their commitment and their willingness to participate in our community. I hope they will continue to build on the ties they have made for many years to come.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said at the outset, I think it is unfortunate that young people are so often the focus of bad news. Today's generation has a great deal to offer, and I thank the 14 young women of Forde who achieved so much to give back to our community.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="4327"><TITLE><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bringing Them Home</EMPHASIS></TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bringing them home</EMPHASIS>  had some airing in the chamber today&mdash;although it was not enough and it went in a roundabout way. I would like to touch on the report this evening. This report does not just deal with areas in the outback of Australia or further out where we see the indigenous people today; it also deals with how we treated the indigenous people in Tasmania.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I quote from page 91, dealing with policies and practices:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The forcible removal of Indigenous children from their families occurred during two periods in Tasmania. The first commenced with the European occupation of Van Dieman's Land (as Tasmania was called until 1856) in 1808 and lasted until the middle of the nineteenth century. The second commenced in the 1930s with the forcible removal of Indigenous children from Cape Barren Island under general child welfare legislation and continues into the present.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I would like to quote also some of the evidence that is in this report. The following comes from a woman in Tasmania who was removed when she was 18 months old:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I wasn't allowed to go to the same school where my natural siblings were attending school. I knew my siblings' names but I didn't know what they looked like. I was told not to contact my natural family . . . My foster family and the Welfare Officer said to me that I shouldn't get in touch with my natural family because they were not `any good'.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I quote another paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We seemed to have a lonely existence at the Home. They had children there who were under Legacy and things like that. Sadly, we didn't have any relatives to come and see us and, you know, we used to get a bit upset when other children could have relatives come, their mothers, and bring them toys and things, perhaps some fruit.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Those are the words of a man who was removed from his grandmother's care from Cape Barren Island in the 1930s. Another person said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I remember when I was very young though, that there was a big thing going around the community then that the government wanted to get the people off the island. I can remember them saying, `Well, I'm not going'. And next thing you see families going off. And one of the ladies . . . she had a little girl out of wedlock, and the welfare came in and threatened her. They said to her she either had to marry the father of that baby or they would come and take the child, so she married. She was very young, and she married.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">A man from Tasmania said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Welfare just took the lot, no reason&mdash;just took us. They took mum and dad to court here for no reason. But there was no neglect. We was happy kids, you know. We just&mdash;we lived in the bush all our lives. Dad never believed in bringing his family to the city, he just loved the bush and that's where we stayed. We were always fed and happy there but I suppose they were looking for this other family and when they came to take them they just decided, `Well, we'll take these as well.' 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4328"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As I said, this comes from evidence from Tasmania of the experiences of the 1930s and 1940s of some of the indigenous people.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many constituents in my electorate of Makin have suggested to me that pride in our country and in its history and institutions should be encouraged not just when we host a major event or celebrate a date of historical significance but in our everyday lives. The Modbury/Golden Grove Apex Club recently proposed the establishment of a national citizenship project to promote pride in our national identity via the `Apex Aussie Proud' project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr David Reed, from the Modbury/Golden Grove Apex Club, stated that the purpose of the project would be to foster national pride and identity. The club stressed, as has the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), the importance of discussing and debating issues about our national identity in a tolerant and well&hyphen;reasoned manner. We should not use discussion about our history and national identity to divide our nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A national citizenship project, as proposed by the Modbury/Golden Grove Apex Club, would have three phases including: recognition of our flag, promotion of the national anthem, promotion of multicultural Australia&mdash;which is inclusive of our indigenous Australians&mdash;and promotion of Australian history and our future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am delighted to inform those members who may not be aware that this process has already begun with the recent launch by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the Hon. Bruce Scott MP, of the commemorative program entitled `Their Service&mdash;Our Heritage'. This

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all owe a debt to those men and women who served their country during time of war. This program will enable the entire Australian community to honour their contribution to the protection of our national independence and individual liberty. As a part of this initiative I am pleased to see that there will be major sponsorship of the national history challenge for school students and the provision of kits to all schools to assist with the commemoration of Anzac Day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian War Memorial will also present a travelling exhibition that will visit local communities around Australia, telling the history of our war effort and the heroism of our veterans. This and many other projects under the banner `Their Service&mdash;Our Heritage' will lead to a greater understanding of the history and the sacrifice made by the soldiers on the battlefield and by those who kept the home fires burning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to ensure that all Australians have access to information about the history of Australia. We can start by ensuring that history is taught to all students and that they have a sound grasp of the fundamental origins and importance of Australia's institutions. This includes the contribution to our culture and nation by indigenous Australians so that there will be greater understanding of the need for reconciliation. This will also lead to a greater level of informed debate and discussion and help to cement in our society that spirit of tolerance that we all prize.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The arrival and integration of peoples from many different nations into the Australian community has been one of the great success stories of our history.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is appropriate that we discuss this package of bills together. Essentially one matter is being dealt with and the proper parliamentary processes require it to be considered in a package of legislation. The opposition will be supporting the package of legislation and the government amendment, of which we have been advised and which will be formally considered in the consideration in detail stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation concerns the NICNAS&mdash;the industrial chemicals notification and assessment scheme&mdash;that has been developed over the last decade. It is a worthwhile program for the improvement of the occupational health and safety of Australian men and women at work and as such it has had, and deserves, the bipartisan support of everybody in the parliament. We 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4332"> are talking about setting up proper processes for ensuring that these chemicals, which are necessarily used in the proper process of important production, are safe and are used safely, and that proper arrangements are put in place for industrial access and their use.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is therefore appropriate that on this occasion we are in a position to respond positively to the government's initiative, which is really only in small part a variation from an initiative considered by the previous government, and which will implement a decision formulated by the previous government, concerning cost recovery in the industrial chemicals notification and assessment scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under this scheme, all new industrial chemicals are assessed before their importation or manufacture so that recommendations about appropriate safeguards can be made before their use. Chemicals already in use and causing concern can be selected for assessment as priority existing chemicals. In total, over 700 industrial chemicals have been assessed in the six years NICNAS has been in operation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real purpose of this package is to replace the current cost recovery arrangements for funding the assessment of existing industrial chemicals with an industry based charge, which is another nice way of saying a tax. This government has a record for elegantly saying it is  going to impose a tax without using the word `tax'. In this instance it is not something we disagree with at all, but if there were a euphemism contest the government would definitely win.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the move to full cost recovery is appropriate. I will say something briefly in a moment about a method but there is no question about the principle. It was decided in the context of the 1994&hyphen;95 budget of the previous government to move to full cost recovery, so there is no argument of principle about it. Nor is there any concern regarding the consequential amendments which flow from the need to ensure the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission's  administration of the scheme and that the moneys are properly collected in accordance with the constitution and properly applied to the purposes of this scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I indicated, it was decided in the context of the 1994&hyphen;95 budget to move NICNAS to full cost recovery in the 1996&hyphen;97 financial year, aligning it with the cost recovery arrangements applying to agricultural and veterinary chemicals. There were reports about both the implications of that move by the so&hyphen;called Gwynne report and the mechanisms to achieve full cost recovery conducted by Access Economics. When you put all that material together, it certainly leads to the conclusion that the principle that this is a scheme that should operate on the basis of full cost recovery is appropriate, and the timing and the consequential amendments are quite adequate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From the opposition's point of view we are relaxed about supporting these proposals. I just want to make two qualifications. They do not in any way constitute opposition; they constitute reservations to some extent caused by the lack of information. The government has been very cooperative in briefing us, but in opposition the access to information is more limited than in government. So I want to flag these two things while not in any way qualifying our support for the package and the amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not convinced at this stage that, had we been implementing the decision of 1994&hyphen;95 ourselves, we would have gone down this route of cost recovery. We would have pursued cost recovery; I am not sure that this mechanism&mdash;with registration and a sort of two&hyphen;tier system&mdash;is the one we would have used. I have some qualification about that, but it is not an unfair or unreasonable proposal. The government has given it consideration. Its arguments for putting 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4333"> it forward are reasonable, and I have no quibble at this point with its rights to proceed in the way that it wishes to pursue cost recovery. As long as it does not come into fundamental conflict of principle, then the mechanism it chooses is essentially an administrative matter for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did have a discussion with the officers of the department about the other reservation I have. I understand their argument and I do not have an alternative to put forward. But this reservation, which is more substantive than that about funding, is about the way in which the bill deals with the so&hyphen;called small quantities matter. I do not want to debate that in detail. People who are interested will know what I am referring to, and people who wish to research it will find it adequately covered in the explanatory memorandum. I simply want to say that that is the operative reservation I have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The officers have put the explanation of why the government has proceeded in this way to me. I understand that point and I certainly do not intend at this stage to propose any amendment. It would take a lot more resources and independent research capacity to be able to develop an alternative, and this proposal may work very well. I would be delighted to find that my reservations are unfounded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Overall, this is a package which we support. It implements a principle that the previous government had proposed. I notice, and I think this is appropriate, that the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) said in his second reading speech that he has established what he called a non&hyphen;statutory industry consultative committee. I do not know in full its composition and I hope it is representative. But the point I want to make is not about that&mdash;I think it is appropriate that the minister has a consultative committee. I hope that if, as is referred to in the second reading, it makes recommendations for improvements to the scheme then those recommendations will be public or at least available to the industry, to employees and their organisations, and to the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has indicated to us that they intend to move, and they have distributed, a minor amendment. The opposition has no problem with that minor amendment; we understand its purpose and we support it. If the scheme is going to proceed, that amendment is necessary to make its operation proper and appropriate in accordance with the management of public moneys, so we have no problem with it. We will therefore be supporting this package of legislation and the government amendment through the Main Committee and when they return to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to participate in this cognate debate involving the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Amendment Bill 1997. It is good to hear the contribution of the member for Canberra (Mr McMullan) in that he has basically signalled that the opposition supports the measure, but with some reservations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously, in matters of any nature that come before the House, one would be foolish to say that there are not some reservations about measures that are introduced, particularly about a measure that is basically moving in a different direction from what has been in the past. Therefore, we have to tread somewhat warily at times, particularly in an area like this, to ensure that ultimately the best result will be achieved not only for the consumers and for the workers who have to work with the chemicals but also for the industry, the marketing industry, research and development and so forth.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4334">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Canberra was a little uncharitable in his comment about euphemisms. Of course, if one is to enter into that debate, members of the previous government were past masters of the art of euphemisms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose of the bill is basically to bring into line an overall government philosophy of user pays, which is one I thoroughly endorse. Using chemicals in modern society is, some would say, a necessary hazard. So, consistent with modern trends, schemes need to encourage less hazardous chemicals entering the market. This bill addresses the need to provide a more effective assessment of new and existing chemicals. Constant development of new chemicals requires more cost-effective measures for that assessment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill follows the recommendations of the Gwynne report involving the facilitating of movement to full cost recovery and improvement in the effectiveness of the national industrial chemicals notification and assessment scheme, known as NICNAS. The scheme encourages a user pays philosophy, which I have already referred to and which characterises the government's general philosophy across a wide number of areas. It is a responsible budgetary measure in that context. It brings the scheme into line with comparable regulatory authorities such as the National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should be noted in passing that in relation to constituent problems that I have encountered involving small businesses and the NRAAVC, it is important in an area which is aligned to  that sort of regulatory authority to ensure that the scheme will work effectively and will not be a vehicle to discourage small businesses in their trading activity. The national registration authority has, unfortunately, in the past not been all that helpful, particularly to small businesses. This is not the place to go into that, but I do have some reservations about the operation of the labelling scheme that was brought in by the previous Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The charging mechanism for cost recovery for existing chemicals will bring program efficiencies and enable a variety of assessment approaches to be implemented, including the assessment of groups of chemicals and safer substitutes. The small businesses in my electorate are aware of the demanding needs of the public for safer chemicals and the overall strategy of the bill will assist these businesses to keep pace with a much more environmentally concerned consumer market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More specifically, for new chemicals in the Australian inventory of chemical substances, the director will be able to remove chemicals wrongly included and add details of trade name products, making the inventory more accurate for users. An amendment adds additional exemption for research and development chemicals introduced solely in the course of a program of research, development or analysis, provided certain safeguards are met.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An additional exemption eliminates the need for notification and assessment for new chemicals introduced in quantities of less than 10 kilograms per year where no risk to occupational health and safety is involved, or any environmental risks are involved. This will particularly assist the cosmetic industry in making it more competitive. That industry is a developing one in this country and needs to be encouraged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A further amendment permits the director to expedite new industrial chemicals within 28 days, pending completion of an assessment report, if the chemical is not hazardous or dangerous. Other amendments streamline assessment reports, remove the need for duplicate assessments, allow existing assessments to be extended to cover subsequent importers and for specific reports from an approved foreign scheme to be used. All of these will ultimately make for greater efficiency.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4335">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to existing chemicals, proposals from the 1994 evaluation report on the existing chemicals program are being implemented. Information about the use and introduction of chemicals will be more readily available and there will be some cross flow of information about chemicals prior to their declaration as priority existing chemicals&mdash;PECs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The further amendments in relation to the application for early introduction for non&hyphen;hazardous chemicals will facilitate the entry into Australia of new industrial chemicals that are considered to be non&hyphen;hazardous. In many cases, these new chemicals will replace older, hazardous chemicals. This is a very good system because it allows for faster replacement of hazardous chemicals and, as has been said by the minister, NICNAS has operated on partial cost recovery since its inception. This bill moves, of course, to full cost recovery. The current scheme for existing chemicals does not result in fair cost sharing in the industry and the 1995 review said it was an unworkable scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A company registration will replace the current fee collecting mechanism. A new register called the Register of Industrial Chemical Introducers will mean that all persons who introduce industrial chemicals with the total value of more than half a million dollars will be required to register and pay a charge assessed at $1,200 if the value is between the range of $0.5 million and $5 million. The scale of charges goes up depending on the value of introduced chemicals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, as I have said before, this scheme will ensure that the industry is more cost efficient. It will encourage research and development. It will reduce the reliance on hazardous chemicals and ultimately will encourage, in my view, small businesses to provide products that the market&mdash;and particularly consumers&mdash;are seeking. The environment will be spared in the process from the extra dangers which an unbridled chemical industry would produce in a society increasingly concerned about chemical waste.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most of all, given that many workers in my electorate are working with chemicals in the course of their employment in engineering and other workshops where the use of chemicals is fairly widespread, it is important to ensure that workers and their families are protected from hazardous chemicals. I believe that this process will assist in eliminating older, hazardous chemicals and bring with it the more modern and environmentally friendly chemicals, thus protecting workers and their families from unnecessary hazards. Having regard to comments that I have made and those that relate to the overall philosophy and direction of the bill, I support this measure and commend it to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is my job this morning to represent the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) in the debate on the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Amendment Bill and cognate bills, and to sum up in the Main Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The national industrial chemicals notification and assessment scheme&mdash;NICNAS, as it is termed&mdash;was established in 1989 to assess the health and environment risks of all new industrial chemicals and selected existing chemicals. In total, over 700 industrial chemicals have been assessed in the six years that NICNAS has been in operation. NICNAS has operated on partial cost recovery since its inception, and this bill and its cognate bills will move NICNAS to full cost recovery, consistent with other Commonwealth chemical assessment schemes. Currently, costs are recovered by a system of application fees for the assessment carried out. This has worked well for new chemicals but not, however, for existing chemicals.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4336">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will implement a system of company registration to replace the current fee collection mechanism for existing chemicals. The bill also establishes a new register, the Register of Industrial Chemical Introducers. All persons who introduce industrial chemicals with an annual total value of more than $0.5 million will be required to register and pay a registration charge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Company registration was first proposed by the previous government in 1995. Following extensive consultation with industry, we have refined the scheme to minimise its impact on business. A two&hyphen;tier system of registration charges will apply, with a lower charge of $1,200 and a higher charge of $7,000 for large introducers. The $0.5 million initial registration threshold will ensure that small businesses will not be affected. Company registration will enhance the operation of NICNAS by overcoming problems in its current cost recovery mechanism for existing chemicals. Costs will be shared more widely with the industry, as a result of this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill amends the process of assessing existing industrial chemicals to ensure a better targeting of risks and a more flexible approach to assessment. New chemical assessment procedures will also be streamlined by allowing the early introduction of non&hyphen;hazardous chemicals, and additional exemptions for chemicals introduced in amounts of less than 10 kilograms per year. These amendments bring the Australian scheme into line with comparable schemes overseas and also enhance the efficiency of the scheme in moving to full cost recovery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also makes important changes to the Australian inventory of chemical substances. The inventory lists all chemicals imported or manufactured in Australia since 1977. The amendments will allow the continued listing of chemicals in the confidential section, subject to a review every five years. The test for inclusion in the confidential section has been strengthened. Currently, only the prejudice of the commercial interests of the person or company is considered. This will be changed to require the director to balance that prejudice against the public interests of disclosure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also makes minor amendments to improve the operation of the act, including by updating certain definitions. In summary, the bill and its cognate bills are aimed at further enhancing the operation of NICNAS while introducing full cost recovery and further streamlining assessment procedures. As a result of these reforms, assessments under NICNAS will be able to focus more on the chemicals posing the greatest risk to the Australian people and the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I thank the member for Canberra (Mr McMullan) and the member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith) for their contribution to this bill. I listened to the opposition spokesman, the member for Canberra, who seemed to get a little lost in his speech. He was suggesting that he and the opposition would be supporting&mdash;as they are&mdash;the bill, but seemed to go onto a tack of getting lost on policy, once again. Whilst they support full cost recovery&mdash;which was an area in which we, in opposition, supported their thrusts&mdash;he seemed to be saying, `We're not quite sure about that now.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition ought to take a good, hard look at where they are going, because the shadow spokesman seemed to be getting lost. He also suggested that this levy was a tax. I would remind the opposition that under their bills, which we supported, it was indeed a levy. They are trying to target the government with introducing a tax and we reject that assertion. I would suggest to the opposition that the bed levy introduced by the Labor Premier of New South Wales in Sydney is, in fact, a bed tax and should be properly labelled a tax and not a levy. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4337"> So I think we should forget about the opposition until they really start to focus their policy and get a much greater focus on where they are going.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we do accept their support. We thank them for their contribution. I would just like to remind the opposition that there was full and considerable consultation with the industry before the introduction of these amendments. I thank the Main Committee.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition is not opposing the main thrust of the National Residue Survey (Ratite Slaughter) Levy Bill 1997, which is now before the House. The levy has been requested by the Emu Farmers Federation of Australia, and will be set at 75c per bird slaughtered for human consumption. As the explanatory memorandum which accompanies the bill points out, the function of the national residue survey is to monitor and assess the level of chemical residues in raw plant and animal products, and to give domestic and international consumers confidence in the quality and safety of those particular products.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At a time when non&hyphen;tariff barriers are increasingly being used by our trading partners to block access to their markets, this measure will go a long way towards securing access to those overseas markets for this industry. This is a relatively new industry in Australia, and it is one

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Australia and other industrialised countries, rising affluence has stimulated the demand for exotic meats. We know that particular niche demands exist in particular countries throughout the world for the exotic meats that are now the subject of the debate before the House. It is not too long ago that Australian tastes in meat were confined largely to beef, lamb and chicken. However, dining out today&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What about rabbits?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WU5">Mr O'CONNOR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) would know all about rabbits because there are plenty in the Wannon electorate. They were clubbed to death there in the postwar era. I am sure, as a child, the member participated in the mass slaughter of the rabbit population of his electorate, as I did in the electorate of Corangamite where my father's dairy farm was located. We are dealing today with ostriches and emus, and we will keep the rabbits off the plate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dining out today, one is confronted with a range of exotic meats to test one's palate. The amount of meat consumed in Australia has not changed dramatically in recent years; however, the variety of meat that is being bought and consumed has. An important part of our more affluent lifestyle is that we eat out more often. That is accompanied by a desire to experiment with the specialty and exotic meats that are available in restaurants today. Once consumers enter the zone of trying exotic meats there is a natural tendency to try new cuts of meat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Wannon mentioned rabbits and our upbringing. While I was growing up on a farm in the Western District, our family's meat consumption was largely confined to lamb and beef. We had chicken once a year at Christmas time, and we ate rabbit stew and we hunted ducks. That supplemented the meat diet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, in the last 12 months, I have become a consumer of exotic meats. On the odd occasion that I go out to dinner&mdash;and it is not as frequently, of course, as the honourable member for Wannon, whom I hear has been seen around the shopping malls of Manuka on many occasions&mdash;my meat consumption includes kangaroo, emu and venison.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yabbies do not really come under the ratite category, as the honourable member knows. As I was saying, my consumption of exotic meats has increased in the last 12 months as, as a consumer, I have experimented when I have gone out to dinner. I am part, as are we all, of the rising demand for these commodities in Australia. Often there is a consumer perception that these meats contain lower levels of fat and cholesterol, and so they are increasingly in demand from more sophisticated consumers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The emu industry began in Australia in the early 1970s. Since then, the industry has developed into one supplying meat products, skins and oils to a highly specialised niche market. Emu meat is low in fat and cholesterol and obviously appeals to health&hyphen;conscious consumers, such as the member for Wannon, who are out there for a dining experience that features exotic meats.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4340">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The skin and leather of the emu are also used in a variety of fashion clothes and in the manufacture of wallets, watchbands and other products. The oils are reputed to have healing powers for a range of skin disorders and muscular ailments. Being a keen Australian super rules player, I am certainly going to check out the emu oil and use it in that recovery period after each match that we play of a Sunday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as the Australian ostrich industry is concerned&mdash;and that is another bird in the ratite family that is the subject of this legislation&mdash;it is estimated that over 70,000 birds are farmed annually in Australia. A relatively lucrative market exists overseas for ostrich meats, leather and feathers. I am not suggesting that the honourable member for Wannon would know much about ostrich feathers, but he certainly knows a lot about rabbit fur, being an old boy from the Western District of Victoria where rabbits existed in plague proportions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ostrich industry has undergone a resurgence in recent years. It has developed a sound marketing program to guide its development beyond the year 2000. As I mentioned before, exotic consumer tastes are the order of the day for the modern Australian palate and ostrich meat is rapidly becoming a favourite among many Australians and the meat is being used to produce sausages, pates and hams.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ostrich industry has also become a destination for investors seeking out new opportunities in agricultural industry in Australia today. That investment is now developing and expanding the production base because of the export potential for the meats and other products, especially in substantial markets such as China. Investors are committing funds to develop the national herd and to supply those lucrative domestic markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a word of caution sounded from the ASC on the rather extravagant claims of many promoters of these investment schemes in the industry. Nonetheless, there are investment funds flowing into the industry on the back of identified export potential in markets in Japan and, of course, China.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I attended the Alternative Farm Vision Expo that was held in Geelong recently. I congratulate the Herald and Weekly Times for their sponsorship of that particular event and the organisers who collected from all over Australia people who are currently involved in alternative farming. The industries that I mentioned, the ostrich and emu industries, were prominently featured at that Alternative Farm Vision Expo. Both of those industries are rapidly acquiring an important status in Australian agriculture as niche industries and highly specialised industries in the rural sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is very important that we recognise the contribution of these industries to Australian agriculture and also that we encourage the diversity of agricultural production. If we go back 20, 30 or 40 years, Australian agriculture was pretty well confined. Now, in the 1990s, and as we go toward the year 2000, many farmers who have grown up in those traditional industries are seeking new opportunities in alternative forms of agriculture, which are typified by the industries that I have mentioned here today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are important industries because they give an export focus to Australian agriculture. Often these industries, as they get into highly specialised and lucrative overseas markets, reinforce the image of Australia as an agricultural producer of diversity and enhance the reputation of Australian producers who are able to supply quality products to these particular markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me also add that the development of these industries is also very important to regional economies such as my own in the electorate of Corio and the economies further out in the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4341"> Western District, typified by the presence of the honourable member for Wannon here today. They are very important activities; they are part of the patchwork, the quilt of agricultural production that really has sustained and diversified many rural communities that over the course of time have suffered some hardship in the more traditional industries in those areas.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am a bit out of my territory&mdash;I am surrounded by that aerial ping&hyphen;pong game. To return to the National Residue Survey (Ratite Slaughter) Levy Bill, many members may wonder why I am interested in a bill of this nature. I have not canvassed honourable members but, as far as I am aware, I am the only member who lives next door to an emu farm.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This emu farm was established in 1995 by John and Betty Schmidt. It has become a significant focal point for tourist buses and local people. The restaurant at the farm serves emu steak, emu sausages and many varieties of emu meat. Anna and I were privileged to attend the opening of the Mount Samson Emu Farm in 1995. It was a momentous occasion for the Mount Samson and Samsonvale district, which is in the western part of my electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am happy to say that, while the emus do make a rather unusual noise, they are an added bonus to the tourism industry generally in south&hyphen;east Queensland because this is another stop&hyphen;off point for people who are looking to experience a slice of Australiana. The farm is also the genesis of an industry which is going to move Australia into the next century. It is significant in the case of John and Betty Schmidt that they and their father were dairy farming for many years and that they have now moved into this industry. It has not been easy to make that transition but they are innovative and entrepreneurial people. They are making a very solid go of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation recognises significant changes in the propensity of Australians to change their eating habits, and that is shown by what we are now seeing in restaurants. I was in Sydney recently and noticed emu on the menu in a restaurant. I was told that it is not an unusual feature of restaurants in the Sydney area. It is also something that is becoming more prevalent in Brisbane and I imagine that generally it will catch on across Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As has been said, emu meat in particular is low in cholesterol and fat and that fact will encourage an export industry. This particular measure is very much linked to that, because consumers worldwide expect a very solid standard of food quality and safety, as was said by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) in his second reading speech.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Markets require a residue monitoring program managed by government as a prerequisite for produce access. Chemical residues can also be used as a form of non&hyphen;tariff trade barrier, so 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4342"> this initiative has an important role, as was said by the minister, in developing and maintaining market access for this increasingly important industry. As has been mentioned, it is not just emus but it can include large flightless vertebrates such as ostriches, cassowaries, rhea and kiwi.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not very far from my electorate, again in that north&hyphen;western area, is an ostrich farm run by Louise Willard and her husband. This indicates another progression in the use of native birds, not only for breeding&mdash;eggs, chicks and so forth&mdash;but into the development of a marketing industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to see the way in which these developments are taking place and are progressing the primary industries of this country. Primary industry is, in many respects, the backbone of this country and it is good to see that it is moving with the times. I will mention here that the Cherbourg Aboriginal community, with which I have been significantly involved over the years, has an emu abattoir and farm&mdash;they have just over 300 birds. I was out there just last Thursday. That farm provides employment for Aboriginal people, particularly young Aboriginals, under the CDEP program. It also has become a significant tourist attraction in the area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my view, this process, particularly as I have related it to emus and the experience in my own electorate, and from my association with Cherbourg, will give confidence to the industry at a time when it needs confidence. It will progress the industry so that in time one may well expect that there will be a significant local domestic market in the consumption of these birds and in the use of by&hyphen;products. There is the potential for an international market and that is already in progress. With this system of monitoring for chemical residues during the processing of these meats we can look forward to an export industry that will do Australia proud. I firmly support this measure.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on this bill because I think I can claim to be one of the pioneers of the emu industry in Australia and I have watched with some concern its progress. When I became a member of parliament in 1980, there was only one emu farm in Australia, and that was at the Ngangganawili Aboriginal community of Wiluna. The Department of Aboriginal Affairs, as it was then, had taken the decision to close it down. I put my own money in to keep this project going and fought tenaciously to save that project from being closed down under both Liberal and Labor governments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The industry did start in Western Australia and it was a very difficult beginning. It was strenuously opposed by all sorts of people, particularly the conservation lobby. I remember one member of the Labor Party denouncing me and saying that it was outrageous that I should support the eating of half of Australia's coat of arms. I remember telling the man that he was a fool and that we had been eating the other half for a hundred years or more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the industry started the rules were that all emus that were entered into commercialisation had to be sourced from the stock at Wiluna. This was, in my view, a very silly rule but it was one put in there at the insistence of CALM, Conservation and Land Management, in its endeavours to contain the industry and basically stop its growth, I guess. What it did, of course, was limit the stock and drive up the price of emu chicks. So instead of the industry doing as it should have done&mdash;getting out and seeking the sale of product&mdash;it developed in a very incestuous way by selling chicks to itself. The price of those chicks got out of control because of the limit on the origin of the stock.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4343">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the Labor Party was swept away in Victoria, Kennett changed the rules and in a very short time Victoria had more emus under management than Western Australia. The sad thing, of course, is that the United States has far more emus in captivity than there are emus in the whole of Australia. It was a golden opportunity lost. It was lost because people did not pay attention to the product.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Honourable member interjecting</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CF4">Mr CAMPBELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is true, I am used to that, though, comrade. The potential for the skins and the leather was clearly enormous. In seeking a market for this, I approached users in the United Kingdom who had had experience with what they called emu but it was in fact a rare bird from South America. That rare bird was captured in the wild and it was very hard to get any skins that were not badly damaged. The end product was only available for watch straps and belts. There simply was not enough unscarred material for anything else.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I convinced them that we would be providing them with a much bigger skin, a genuine emu skin, and that because the birds were in captivity the skins would generally be unblemished, the opening order was for a million skins. I suggested that three or four dozen would be more than we could handle at the time, but it was quite clear that we had to have volume. Manufacturers told me that nothing under 10,000 skins would be considered a worthwhile run, and unless we had volume, we were not going to be able to get the skins onto the market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The emu skin has enormous potential. It is undoubtedly the best bookbinding skin in the world. It is a very soft skin that drapes well and therefore is also suitable in the clothing industry. The other product of great interest is oil. A mature bird will produce something like  10 litres of oil. The oil is very penetrating and it is suggested that as a subcutaneous carrier it will get through the skin perhaps 1&half; to two per cent of a treatment, and that is probably 100 per cent more than is available at the moment. So it has enormous potential as a subcutaneous carrier of other medications and this, too, I believe, was never fully explored for the reasons that the industry was just selling chicks to itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The meat always had potential. It is cholesterol free. The meat you are talking about is off the breast of the bird; the great bulk of meat on the leg is only suitable for sausages. Sausages are being made in Western Australia and they are quite tasty&mdash;I actually tried to get them introduced to the parliamentary dining room without success.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Looking at this ratite levy, I think the Emu Farmers Federation of Australia is again making a very foolish mistake. The markets for emu are basically the United Kingdom, Europe and Japan, and I see no suggestion that either of those countries is likely to use non&hyphen;tariff barrier mechanisms to stop the entry. So I do not really see a threat there and I think they are foolish to involve the government. I notice the levy is set at 75c with a maximum of $5 per head, and they are wrong if they think that that levy is not going to rise. It will rise and they will find in years to come that the cost of having the government involved is a cost they did not need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite possible for the federation to do random checking itself with a voluntary levy and, in my view, it is all that is needed to get the necessary chemical analysis of the meat. If there were ever an opportunity to sell into markets that were using non&hyphen;tariff mechanisms they could specifically test in that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is indicative of many people. They go running to the government for help when, in fact, they would be much better off doing it themselves. And I cite the efforts of Don Wieringa, the pioneer of human consumption crocodile meat. Don Wieringa used his own 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4344"> money to pay for research to try and eliminate salmonella from crocodile meat. Because of the nature of the animals, salmonella was very hard to eradicate from crocodiles&mdash;certainly in the wild it is always there. Through his own research, he came up with a feeding management program which eliminated salmonella from crocodile meat and, immediately, he was confronted with overseas orders which he simply could not meet. Interestingly enough, some of the big orders came from British Airways and Japanese Airways that wanted to offer it as a first class fare on their aeroplanes but would not do so while it had the association with salmonella.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I recently had an enjoyable holiday on the border of Mozambique&mdash;a fascinating country. Returning to the legislation before the Committee, I am not opposing the bill&mdash;it is the will of the Emu Farmers Federation. I just want to put on the record that I think they are making a mistake. Self&hyphen;management would have been a much better role for them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also think that the government could have done much more in helping to develop the potential of the skin and the oil. Some government funded research on the use of the oil clearly would have been enormously beneficial to the whole country. The government has failed to do it&mdash;unfortunately it seems to be the nature of governments to miss these opportunities. The industry now is a much larger industry in the United States than it is here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ostriches, I think, have been somewhat better managed. Australia, of course, has a longer history of commercialising the ostrich than it has of commercialising the emu. Ostrich feather farms were in existence in Australia before the turn of the century. Most of them disappeared when ostrich feathers went out of fashion in the fashion industry. When you visit the South African ostrich industry, a lot of those feathers now are for things other than the fashion industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might digress&mdash;emu feather is substantially different from ostrich feather. If it is stripped off the main stem, the feather has a lot of the properties of down for which, of course, there is an enormous market. I believe ostrich feathers too could have been commercialised to a far greater extent than has been the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, we were exporting ostriches for the fashion industry but that went out of fashion&mdash;I was involved in actually catching ostriches for export to the world. The reason was that South Africa put a ban on the export of their ostrich. The ostrich used in South Africa for feather production is not a native, it is a hybrid bird, and the South Africans very sensibly were trying to limit its export. Those birds were, however, already in Australia and we exported them, mainly from a place called Port Augusta in South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An ostrich is a much bigger bird than the emu and much harder to handle. We found that the best way to handle them was to mark the nest, collect the eggs and incubate them just 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4345"> before hatching. The company I worked for had a very successful business in this line. It was put out of business in 1960 by a very foolish government action which banned the export of all Australian fauna and left the company only with canaries and ostriches. This was not big enough to support the company. We had a situation where it was quite permissible to kill Australian animals but illegal to export them. Of course, that is a nonsense. But it is interesting to note that in all these years&mdash;some 37 years&mdash;we have never been able to amend that bill to get any commonsense into the action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The emu and the ostrich industries both have potential. They certainly have my goodwill. I believe that ostriches and emus are both compatible running with other stock. Certainly that is so with ostriches, which are in some sense amenable to the same sort of husbandry as sheep. The difference between the birds is that the male emu looks after the eggs during the night and the female during the day, whereas the male ostrich sits and hatches the eggs entirely on its own. I noticed in South Africa that there are quite a lot of people running stock sheep with ostriches, and I am sure that will be the case in Australia. I think it does represent a useful adjunct to our industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is not much more I want to say on the bill. I think the federation is making a mistake, and I am sure that the ratite breeders will see that levy rise in the near future, even if only to fund the cost of government collection.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the National Residue Survey (Ratite Slaughter) Bill 1997 before the Main Committee today. As the previous speaker has alluded to, the ostrich industry in Australia has grown dramatically over the years. I have learnt today that the earlier development of the industry was purely on the basis of providing ostrich feathers for fashion; but, certainly, the ostrich industry today is one that is developing at a very rapid rate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand some of the statistics are very interesting, in that there are 2,008 ostrich farmers nationally. In New South Wales alone, in my home state, there are 450; and in the region that I represent, the mid north coast of New South Wales, there are 237. A couple of the leading ostrich farmers in New South Wales are in my area, particularly around the Hastings area based on Port Macquarie and Wauchope&mdash;and I talk of Steve and Janelle Gerke, John Pitkin and Howard Kerr, Kevin Gleeson, Peter Aitken and Peter Baber. They have some substantial investments in the ostrich industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that this bill has probably been put together at the instigation of the Federation of Emu Producers or the emu industry; but, because it has to refer to ratites generally, it includes ostriches as well. I probably agree to a certain extent with the sentiments of the previous speaker, that self&hyphen;regulation would be better. It is interesting to note that the emu federation has come to the government and asked the government to organise the collection of this levy, because it has been self&hyphen;regulation all the way as far as the ostrich industry is concerned, I understand. That has worked relatively well, particularly through the R&amp;D phase.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the industry has developed, it has grown beyond that, particularly in recent months, to the size it is now. A number of test slaughters have been undertaken; the meat that is being produced from the ostriches is being well and truly accepted; and, certainly, the by&hyphen;products of feather and leather are also very popular.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the moment there are throughout Australia nine plants that process ostriches, and they include four export accredited plants. Three are for the European Union market and two are currently in the process of getting halal accreditation, particularly for those emerging South&hyphen;East Asian markets and the Middle East. There are another two undergoing export accreditation. There are three domestic accredited plants. Two are in New South Wales&mdash;one 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4346"> at Narrandera, in the electorate of my colleague the member for Riverina (Mr Hicks), and the other at Frederickton, just north of my electorate, in Deputy Speaker Nehl's electorate of Cowper.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Ostrich Association expects that there will be 12,000 birds processed this year and 20,000 in 1998. That gives you an idea of the size that the industry has developed itself to. I highlight the point that it has done this in a self&hyphen;regulatory manner as far as the development of the industry and the development of the export mechanisms go. I will come to the point about quarantine inspection within ports of developmental stock in a minute, and the role that AQIS has played in that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to highlight a couple of other important elements of the industry. Australia leads the way in meat development through the Australian Ostrich Company, which is the commercial arm of the Ostrich Association, and has developed a meat description language that will become the basis of international meat language for ostrich meat. If that gets set in place and becomes universal&mdash;particularly if it becomes the single universal language across Australia&mdash;then they will be leading the beef industry, which at this stage still has not achieved the goal of setting a nationally accepted and universal grading system for the beef industry&mdash;a goal that this government is working towards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The industry is also at the forefront of developing, through R&amp;D, opportunities for the leather that is processed from the industry. Recently, Australian Exotic Leathers and the AOC secured a contract for providing 1,000 Australian farmed and tanned hides per month to Japan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the industry is going extremely well. It has, as I said, put in the hard yards to date. It has been going through the developmental stages, and all under self&hyphen;regulation as far as that is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The spirit of what this bill is trying to achieve is important&mdash;as you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker Andrew, representing a rural electorate. There are more than just tariff type trade barriers around the world. Again, I accept the comments of the previous speaker, the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), that at this stage there are no indications that these are being applied in any of the countries that we export ostrich or ratite product to, but we need to be ahead of the game in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill allows the imposition of the levy on all ratites. At the moment, it is set at 75c per head, with the opportunity to increase it to $5 per head. Ultimately it would be in the interests of everybody if that became a self&hyphen;regulatory process, and that will probably happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, as previous speakers have indicated, the government has been asked to initiate this. A lot of the areas involving the development of industry and services in Australia require government initiation ultimately, with the responsibilities then being handed over to the industry. For instance, the government is in the process of doing that with the beef industry at the moment. So that in itself is important. If the ratite industry generally accepts the spirit of what is being done here and works with it in a professional manner, then we are going to see the development of a very important export industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said earlier that I wanted to make some comments on the involvement AQIS has had in the development of this industry to date. The member for Kalgoorlie alluded to the fact that no birds were allowed to be exported out of South Africa. Most of the breeding stock in Australia, I understand, originally came from Canada, and we cannot import from the United States. All breeding stock are implanted with a microchip so they can  track where those birds have come from and what the history of those birds is.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4347">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have worked with one of my local breeders, Kevin Gleeson. In conjunction with other breeders, he has been a major importer of breeding stock and a major player in developing the ostrich industry in Australia. I think we should recognise that fact&mdash;bearing in mind the terms we have discussed, the size this industry is going to be and the export income it is going to develop for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that in recent years Kevin Gleeson had a great deal of trouble with a shipment of imported birds coming from Canada through the quarantine station on the Cocos Islands. I undertook to conduct a bit of research into why&mdash;and I do not think we ever got to the bottom of it&mdash;there was undue delay in the processing of the importation of that group of birds through the Cocos Islands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The birds went through the normal process of quarantine for X number of weeks but were held up for weeks and weeks and weeks on end. My understanding was that there was a concern, without justification and without documentary evidence, about the origin of some of those birds. Kevin bought all of those birds in Canada and brought them through the Cocos Islands on their way into Australia. AQIS seemed to believe at the time that the origin of a couple of the birds was suspect&mdash;that is, that they had come from the United States. My understanding is that that could not be substantiated and ultimately was not, yet the entire shipment was held up on the Cocos Islands&mdash;and this was a 747 aeroplane load of birds&mdash;and the cost to the importer was just unbelievable. It was tens of thousands of dollars extra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just highlight that example. I know there has been a review of the activities of AQIS, I know the government has allocated resources in that area, and I know there is going to be a refocusing and restructuring in that area. But that was just one example of an impediment to a fledgling industry that required an enormous amount of capital by way of investment in breeding stock. I thought that particular importer was being unduly impeded, and without substantiation speed bumps were being put in the way of him developing what he was trying to do in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the time, we put up the proposition that, if there were a couple of birds that they were concerned about the origins of, they could have held those back and let the rest of the shipment go. However, there seemed to be all sorts of bureaucratic reasons as to why they could not. I wanted to make that comment because we are discussing the ratite industry, which includes ostriches and the ostrich industry in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In closing, I support this bill. On the sentiments expressed by members opposite with regard to self&hyphen;regulation, I imagine that that certainly will come in time. I highlight that, as far as the development of the ostrich industry in Australia is concerned, that has been the case, particularly with their research and development. In the case of some operators, like Kevin Gleeson in my electorate, the industry has developed in some isolated cases despite government bureaucracy and the hurdles that have been put in their way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We accept that, because we are a safe and secure continent as far as exotic diseases are concerned, we absolutely need the protection of the Quarantine Inspection Service. All I ask is that, from time to time, it exercise a bit more commonsense and undertake its task in that manner. As far as the protection of primary industries in Australia is concerned, AQIS does its job in a very professional way but, because of the sheer costs involved, some flexibility must be exercised with regard to the ways in which it undertakes its duties. That experience would have sent a lesser operator broke. It was fortunate that the people involved had the resources to withstand the costs that were imposed by the decision taken.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4348">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of trade, we need to be eternally vigilant about what is happening with regard to the non&hyphen;trade barriers that are put in the way of exports, as we do with trade in this country. It is an argument that cuts both ways. Debates are raging at the moment about imported salmon and imported chicken meat. That is exactly what we are talking about. We want to protect our industries from diseases, not from competition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that other countries are going to want to do the same. If we have self&hyphen;imposed quality assurance within Australia so that, as the product leaves, we can guarantee that there are no problems, then we may not face the hurdles which these export industries develop. With those words, I support the bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I address the National Residue Survey (Ratite Slaughter) Levy Bill 1997. People are getting used to seeing a number of big birds as they drive around Tasmania. The development of these birds comes from farming&mdash;as you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker&mdash;being more innovative and needing to raise income from things other than the traditional ways of farming because of the pressure of prices on some of the traditional incomes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead of just seeing sheep and cattle on the farms, some pretty strange beasts are appearing. In Tasmania, the deer farming industry is coming on. It has been around for some time and deer is a respected game food domestically. Many of us enjoy a roast of venison on Sunday in place of some of the more traditional meats. In my family, venison is now a traditional meal. And the likes of emus, ostriches, llamas and other such animals are now becoming familiar outside zoos.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Tasmania we have a fledgling industry in ostriches and  emus. They have a very interesting future, if they can sort out some of the problems that they have. There is plenty  of scope to use the oil from these birds. It is very useful to find an oil that can be used for a number of purposes including cosmetics. So, as I understand it, there is potential there but there are still a lot of issues to be dealt with. I have read about the qualities of the oil but it is not yet at a total commercial situation. The leather of ostriches is very soft and we have heard others speak about this. It has a very good skin pattern and it can be used for fashion accessories such as handbags, belts and shoes. From what I have seen, it looks as though there are very good opportunities out there. I heard my colleagues speak about the quality that it gives to the binding of books.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The meat side of the industry is still in its infancy. There are markets but there are problems to solve first. This bill may start to help the industry gain access to these markets. The idea was put forward by the Emu Farmers Federation of Australia. The purpose of the bill is to enable a national residue survey levy to be introduced. This allows for a levy of 75c per bird, slaughtered, which will go to monitoring the products. This certainly will help in the development of quality assurance in the marketing of the meat. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I am honoured to have a minister here listening to the rest of my speech. The main functions of the residue survey are to monitor and assess the levels of chemical residue in raw Australian plant and animal commodities, and to give domestic and international consumers confidence in the quality and safety of these products. Consumers worldwide expect a high standard of assurance on food safety and quality. Some markets require a residue monitoring program, managed by government, as a prerequisite for product access. Chemical residue issues can also be used as a form of non&hyphen;tariff trade barrier.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4349">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that meat inspections in the future will certainly come down to a live inspection of residue within product. I believe the emu federation is getting in on the ground on this because there will certainly be a need in the future for those measurements. When we go into exporting to other countries, I believe that other countries will demand a certain level from us. This initiative by the emu industry has an important role in developing and maintaining market access for the emu farmers it represents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the moment, I am investigating ways to help achieve a secure and long&hyphen;term slaughter facility in Tasmania so that the industry there can start to develop. Things are a bit hit&hyphen;and&hyphen;miss at the moment and the industry in my state is seeking some new directions. However, I can see some good marketing angles in a chicken drumstick being compared to an emu drumstick: `feed the whole family on one emu leg!'&mdash;eat your heart out, Colonel Sanders&mdash;or `one emu leg on a plate and you could feed the whole family; finger&hyphen;licking good.' Just think of the marketing value in that!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not sure that you could use that old song <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Old Man Emu</EMPHASIS>&mdash;who could run the pants off a kangaroo&mdash;because it may indicate that there might be a bit of toughness in the product. We would probably have to think of another angle for the marketing of that but I am sure that we will come up with something. However, it is a very Australian product. The emu, as is the kangaroo, is part of our coat of arms. But, by the same token, it is a very farmable animal and totally adaptable to the environment. The kangaroo, the emu, and some other species that breed quickly, and are plentiful, can be nicely adapted for farming. They have had plenty of time to become fully adapted to Australian conditions and would be immune to many of the diseases that affect introduced species.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was a report in 1993 that pointed out the possibilities of farming our native animals, rather than treating them as farm pests. The funds raised by the levy will be directed back into  the industry for further development. Therefore it will be of direct benefit to the growers. This has happened for a lot of other primary producers and those people have gained advantages in exchanges of information between growers nationwide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Something similar may be necessary in Tasmania to allow growers to develop their own abattoir so they can take control of their industry. In Tasmania we have had some difficulties in getting an established abattoir to process the birds that we have in the state. People need to come together so that they can get on top of that, either by forming a company or a cooperative of members so that they can benefit from all the effort that they have put in. I do not necessarily think they always need a third party to control the killing and the shipping. They could take some control of this themselves and they would be able to direct the industry's future themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am excited about the possibilities here and I know that, with a little more work, there could be links developed with other growers to pool their energies in marketing and also in export. Only last Saturday I was addressing the deer farmers in my electorate, talking about the potential opportunities we need in relation to transport, and looking at the needs they have that need to be developed and the links that need to be put in place for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think this bill will achieve what it set out to do:  give opportunity for new industries which are emerging; give them protection in the export arena when they are dealing with other countries and access points; and give international consumers confidence in the quality and the safety of the product. I believe that, in the long term, this will be beneficial to the industry and to the growers that are in it. I wish them well in the long term.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am responding to sum up this debate on the National Residue Survey (Ratite Slaughter) Levy Bill 1997 and acting on behalf of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson). I want to say to the member for Lyons (Mr Adams) that I can agree that a leg of emu, particularly if it was a western Queensland emu, would certainly feed more than one family; but perhaps with a Tasmanian emu probably not quite a family.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank members from both sides of the House for their contributions to this important bill and also for the discussions that have contributed to this debate. It is a very new industry for Australia. It is great to see that it is going to be making a contribution to our export wealth in the future and that there is growing interest in Australia in the products from ratites.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose of this bill is to enable the cost of a national residue survey chemical residue monitoring program to be recovered from the ratite emu industry by a national levy mechanism on a fee&hyphen;for&hyphen;service basis. This will allow for long&hyphen;term flexibility for the ratite emu industry in determining the cost of chemical residue programs, thus allowing access to all and any export and domestic market for emu meat products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Concern about chemical residues in food is an increasingly important issue worldwide, as consumers expect a high standard of assurance about food safety and quality. Real or perceived public health issues, such as those involving residues in food, can rapidly alter product consumption patterns and disrupt domestic and international markets for primary products. By providing an independent and authoritative assessment of the residue status of Australian ratite products, the national residue survey puts residue issues in perspective and dispels or averts speculation about the safety of Australian food commodities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Chemical residue issues also form the basis for non&hyphen;trade barriers against our primary products. I notice there were some comments from the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell)  on that issue. Some markets require a residue monitoring program managed by the government as a prerequisite for product access. Other markets consider these issues as trade negotiations. The national residue survey, the NRS, thus has an important role in developing and maintaining market access for these important and developing industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ratite emu industry regards this mechanism as the best way to collect funds for its residue monitoring program and puts it on the most equitable basis. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition has no substantial objections to the substance of the Wine Export Charge Bill 1997 or the Wine Export Charge (Consequential 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4351"> Amendments) Bill 1997, which are now proceeding through this House. The essential feature of the Wine Export Charge Bill 1997 is to introduce a charge on the export of Australian wines to support the export promotion activities of the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation. This is an industry driven proposal to support the promotion program of the corporation, as grant funding for the generic promotion of Australian wines overseas from state and federal sources is coming to an end.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The compulsory export charge is expected to raise around $1 million per year, which will be used to fund part of the promotional program which will include the generic wine promotion, the wine labelling integrity program and wine export control measures. It is pleasing to note that widespread support for this proposal is coming from producers from within the industry itself. At the last meeting of the corporation, support for the proposal ran at some 96 per cent. That support was drawn from large producers, as well as the many small and medium producers who are very important to this particular industry. It is not always the case in rural industries that a proposal such as this can get widespread support within the industry itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an industry with a vision, and the key to that vision is the effective promotion of Australian wines in overseas markets. These activities are vital if Australian wines are to hold their own against strong competition, which is expected to come from producers in South Africa, the emerging producers in South America and producers in central Europe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there is one exciting story in Australian agricultural exporting today it would have to be the Australian wine industry. If we were to go back only 30 years, Australian table wine consumption amounted to little more than two bottles per head. As I was raised in a low-income rural household, with my father being a teetotaller, the consumption of alcohol beverages was not a priority in our household. That was the time that we bottled our own ginger beer on the farm. My only taste of wines was of the fortified kind around Christmas  time when the sherries and brandies made their way to the table. As a youngster I used to scoot around after the adults had had their fill, making some very potent cocktails from which I suffered considerably later on. It was only in my teenage years that I became introduced to&mdash;well, I would not say an exotic alcoholic beverage in beer&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course, I paid dearly for that. As the honourable member for Fowler interjects, I have passed through all of these phases and I have now reached the stage where I am one of those consumers who indulges in excellent Australian table wines. I guess it was only in the 1970s that many of our families got into the consumption of the superb wines that are being produced here in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, how things have changed over those 30 years, so that per capita consumption of table wines is now around 24 bottles. I acknowledge the contribution of the honourable member for Fowler in that particular statistic because I know he is a particular wine buff, along with the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Sercombe) who is sitting beside him in the chamber today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The factors which have contributed to this growth have been the rising population and rising income levels of Australians. Wine is a particular product that is not so much price elastic in economic terms but income elastic. That is, as the income of the nation rises so does domestic consumption, and overseas consumption as well. Australia's long&hyphen;term export performance in this particular industry is predicated on certain growth assumptions that we hope will be evident in overseas countries and major markets. That overseas export performance will be 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4352"> determined by rising incomes in our major markets&mdash;the USA, Japan, the United Kingdom and Sweden.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another factor which has contributed to the growth in domestic wine consumption and production has been the postwar migration boom which has changed our diet and our patterns of wine consumption. Also, with rising disposable incomes, our entertainment and leisure patterns have changed considerably. Accompanying that change has been an increasing incidence of dining out and this has obviously stimulated the domestic consumption of wines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many other factors that have contributed to this burgeoning growth, among them being the fact that the Australian population is becoming increasingly health conscious and, of course, a good glass of wine a day puts a bit of the cream on the cake, if I can use that term, as far as one's health is concerned. The stimulus has also come from within the industry itself, which has been able to increase productivity enormously through the introduction of innovative processing technologies and with improved growing practices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are indeed a nation that is blessed with many natural advantages which have given us those competitive advantages which we now enjoy in certain international markets. Among those natural advantages have been the productivity of our land base and the availability of suitable land in Australia in regional areas of the nation for wine production. We have developed over time a very skilled human resource with a long tradition that goes back to the 1800s in wine production and processing. More recently, we have become world leaders in the production and distribution of innovative technologies involved in the processing of wines. We have established ourselves, not as a large player in the international export arena, but as an influential and significant player.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The history of Australian winemaking goes back to the first European settlements in this nation. Wine production was introduced to Australia by Captain Arthur Phillip in 1788. The  gold rushes in the 1850s were accompanied by an influx of European immigrants. It was that influx which laid the foundation of the vines and the expertise on which Australia's wine industry is currently built. As I have mentioned, the wave of European immigrants after World War II laid a further foundation for the development of the industry which has taken place in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s in such a dramatic fashion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This industry is very important and critical to the development of many regional areas around Australia, including my own. It has been a significant stimulator of employment in those regions and a major source of investment back from the metropolitan areas into the regions of this nation. We are used to hearing a great deal about the drain of investment funds out of regional areas in the form of superannuation that is paid by the rural work force which eventually finds its way into the commercial construction industry in major metropolitan centres. It is very important for regional areas to have industries that attract significant investment out of metropolitan areas back into the regions. The dairy industry is one good example of that. In the debate on the Dairy Produce Levy Bill in this chamber in the budget session, many speakers alluded to the very important fact of that investment and the importance to regional areas for it to take place. The wine industry is another example of the importance of that flow of investment into regional areas. With the spectacular export growth that is predicted for this particular industry, we will see an ever increasing investment taking place in regional areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The wine industry has contributed greatly to the growth of regional tourism and the job growth in related industries that service that particular growth. It is the linkage between the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4353"> wine industry and tourism which offers great domestic potential. Apart from the consumption of wine itself in its various forms, it is the combination of these two particular industries that is going to deliver some very real benefits to regional areas. This particular industry has the added advantage of being a reasonably environmentally friendly form of productive activity, and that aids in stimulating consumption and encouraging investment as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me put in a plug for the wine growing areas around Geelong because, historically, the Geelong region was an important wine growing area in the state of Victoria in the 1800s and 1900s. Disease, unfortunately, wiped out many of the older vineyards, but we have seen in the last 20 years a resurgence in wine producing activities in the region. I do not profess to be an expert in this industry, or in the production of wine, but I am told that the limestone soil formations in the Geelong region are ideal for wine production. Of course, with the general growth in domestic and export demand, along with the various techniques that have been developed in the industry to control pests and disease, this has stimulated the resurgence in the industry in the Geelong region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of the region's wineries are now household names among Australian wines, while others in the region are cutting the mustard very well in the export arena. I would like to mention a few of those wineries because I am sure, Mr Deputy Speaker, that as you go out to dine, not only in this fair city but in your own city and throughout the length and breadth of Australia, you might come across Idyll wines or wines that are produced at Scotchman's Hill, the Bannockburn wines and the Anakie wines. They are all excellent wines coming out of the region and they mix it with the best that are produced in the Barossa Valley and in the Hunter region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very impressed with the vision that the Australian wine industry has developed which is encapsulated in its strategy 2025 document. It also establishes a strategic framework for the  industry over the next five years, from 1997 to 2001. I would like to run through some of the objectives of this particular vision statement. It is very rare indeed within Australian agriculture today that you see an industry prepare such a detailed and comprehensive strategic plan that is going to guide its development, not only in the medium five-year term but right out to the year 2025.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The wine industry has identified a number of key objectives which it says will be important in the development of this industry. Those objectives are to enhance the image and reputation of Australian wines. I would say that that process is really under way, because internationally our wines are recognised as being very good wines in quality and very attractively priced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am reminded of my first term in this parliament. A French delegation came to this parliament, we had dinner in Parliament House and served them some very good Australian wines. The comment that they made was not only on the excellent quality of the wines, but also the attractive price. Bottles of superb quality wine that you were able to pick up in Australia then for about $A15 to $A20 would cost you the equivalent of $40 to $50 to $60 in France itself. They really regarded Australia as one of the hidden treasures of the world as far as wine production was concerned. I think that was an extraordinary compliment coming from the French for the Australian wine growing industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another of the objectives that are listed in the vision statement is to entrench innovation as the growth driver of the industry's competitive advantage. I wish a lot of other agricultural industries would enshrine this particular objective in their practices. If there is one thing that is going to keep Australian agriculture ahead of the pack in the international marketplace it 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4354"> is its capacity to innovate&mdash;not only to produce new products, but also to produce new ways of producing those particular products. We are a very innovative nation, and Australian agriculture is extremely innovative, but there are very few industries in the agricultural sector that have prepared a plan such as this and have enshrined that sort of objective in it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another objective that has been mentioned in the 2025 vision statement is to enhance wine style in quality, purity, uniqueness and diversity. Another is to establish global leadership in specific branded market price segments. Interestingly, when you tie this objective to the plan this particular element does not come to fruition until some 25 to 30 years out. That is what I call real vision. Here is an industry that is prepared to look at its future 20 to 30 years out and set a strategic planning framework in which it will muster not only the human resources, but the productive and financial resources, to give effect to the dramatic growth which it expects over that particular period of time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another objective listed is to capitalise on market growth opportunities by expanding industry capacity. What this statement touches on is the importance of enlarging that productive capacity as the first platform for really expanding the growth of exports and getting to that position where the industry is a global leader in branded market price segments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another objective which has been listed is to extend the scope of industry participation in complementary business sectors. Here the wine industry is attempting to link itself to other industry sectors&mdash;that is, in the research and development areas, in manufacturing generally, in the construction of the innovative processing equipment it has being able to develop, and with the financial sector in providing the funds that are going to propel this development according to this plan, and with the tourism industry. Here is an industry that not only sees itself as an important player domestically in improving its production and, in an export sense,  in expanding its export opportunities, but also sees itself linking not only with other agricultural industries but with other industries throughout the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The vision statement sets out clear directions for the development of the industry. Over the next five years, there will be a period of rapid vineyard expansion. That will mean an expansion of the productive base, and that will set the scene for a growth in the value of production which is expected from the years 2002 to 2015. That will build on the brand strength of Australian wines and cultivate greater market share. The plan goes to the years from 2015 to 2025, when Australia will seek to establish brand leadership in certain market segments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The eventual goal of this plan is to expand production to achieve some $4.5 billion worth of sales by the year 2025. That is an extremely ambitious program of expansion for any industry. But it is coming off the back of a vision; it is coming off the back of a collective will of the industry to achieve; and it is coming off the back of an industry that sees itself at the forefront of agricultural industry development in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The wine industry will require some $5 billion to finance that expansion. Obviously, some of that will come from within the industry itself, but it will have to rely on investment from private investors and new entrants into the industry who are prepared to commit money for this expansion, and from financial institutions in this country which in the past have not been great supporters of new industries and those primary producers in industries that are not top of the shelf, as we say, in an agricultural sense and are not the big powerhouse industries like wheat, sheep and wool. Nevertheless, this industry is a significant one. In the past, it has not been adequately serviced by the financial sector. It is pleasing to see now that many of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4355"> major banks are very keen to lend in regional areas because they understand that a lot of the innovation in Australian agriculture is being propelled out of the regions and a lot of the private investment is taking place there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many other rural industries could take a real leaf out of the wine industry book in its strategic planning. The growth of this industry is really reflected in the dramatic export performance which has been achieved in recent years. It has been quite staggering and it is projected to continue on its growth path. Australian wine exports are expected to double between 1996&hyphen;97 and 2001&hyphen;02. In 1996, exports were valued at around $471 million and they are expected to increase to around $896 million by 2001. That growth has been driven by rising incomes in domestic markets which have propelled demand and also rising incomes in overseas markets. It has been propelled by an expansion of Australia's wine production base and by the changing preferences in wines, moving from the fortified wines more into the table wines, in this country and overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a very interesting and innovative industry; one which is export orientated, one which has demonstrated capacity to innovate, one which sees itself linking with other areas of economic activity, and one which I wish other industries in this country would take heed of. This bill will seek to generate revenues to consolidate and expand the promotional efforts of this industry in overseas markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are going to come under increasing threat from other excellent wine producing nations throughout the world&mdash;in South America, South Africa and Europe. The industry is going to need this generic promotion which is going to establish its leadership position over the life of this strategic plan in certain market segments. So it is a very important piece of legislation from that point and it has the support of growers from within the industry. I congratulate the industry for its vision, its export drive and performance. Let us hope that the great and ambitious targets that are set in its industry plan are achieved over the life of that plan.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with great pleasure that I rise to speak in favour of the Wine Export Charge Bill 1997 and the associated amendments. It is a bill specifically designed to introduce a charge on the exports of Australian wine to assist the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation in its funding of wine export promotions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say that because all sides of the political fence, all sides in the wine industry, the industry hierarchy and an overriding number of the 800 to 900 wineries agree that this is a positive step forward. It is a positive step forward because it is meant to take the wine industry forward. It is an industry that, as we heard the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) quite clearly say, is very competitive on the international marketplace, but is still one that Australia has positive direction for. So this bill is another positive step in the right direction for Australian viticulture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The wine export charge is another piece fitted in the puzzle of the plan the Howard government has. To give due credit to the former government, they helped put in place this plan, particularly in relation to the wine industry and more importantly for Australian agriculture. The wine industry is dreaming big dreams at present and the plan portrayed under the wine industry's strategy 2025, where Australian wines will achieve some $4.5 billion in annual sales by being the world's most influential and profitable supplier of branded wines by the year 2025, is very visionary stuff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are dreams that Hunter vignerons, famous for their semillons, chardonnays and shirazes, will be looking to ride on the back of. Whilst presently holding around 2.5 per cent 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4356"> of the world trade in wine, or 3&half; per cent in wholesale terms of trade by value, the plan by the Australian wine industry is to double that percentage hold on the world market and grasp some 6.5 per cent of total production by 2025.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What makes this vision even bolder&mdash;and it will reap amazing spin&hyphen;offs for the wine industry if it can pull it off&mdash;is that it will achieve it in a world marketplace where the total volume of world wine sales may actually drop, even though the world wine market will rise to around $69 billion in 2025 as consumers shift towards high quality premium wines. The shift will become not just a trickle or a trend, but a flood, and our aim is to push the Australian wine industry to be part of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to come back to that vision because, with wine export figures exploding like champagne corks&mdash;export figures that would make any other industry sector weep, in particular, local agribusinesses&mdash;it is important that we have plans. It is important that we stick to those plans to obtain the best communal benefit. Figures like those for the 1996 wine grape harvest, which was the foundation for new records for the Australian wine industry, undoubtedly explain that enthusiasm, with record production levels and exports totalling a record 129.5 million litres in 1995&hyphen;96, valued at some $470.7 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That trend is complemented by the figures of the Australian Bureau of Statistics, which showed total domestic sales of Australian wine rising in the March 1997 quarter by 1.2 per cent, with exports over that period of 12.4 million litres, valued at $48 million. That is some 13.6 per cent more than the February quantity and an 8.7 per cent rise in export volumes from the previous year. In the calendar year 1996, exports totalled 148 million litres, valued at $551 million, with exports now accounting for over 28 per cent of the total Australian domestic wine production&mdash;a figure that the industry should be truly proud of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The United Kingdom still remains our largest export market, representing 46 per cent of the quantity and 43 per cent of our total wine export value of some $250 million. It is followed by the United States, where the market, on figures released in January this year, is now worth $97.4 million per year, and climbing rapidly. For New Zealand, it is $39.4 million; for Canada, $28.8 million; and Japan is up 11 per cent. In total, we now export our local wine to some 60 countries throughout the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The wine industry has developed the concept of an export charge proposal&mdash;a point highlighted by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) in the second reading speech for this bill&mdash;because of the concerns that the Wine and Brandy Corporation had to wind down its generic export promotion program for Australian wine as Commonwealth and state grant funding for export promotion came to an end.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The approach by the representatives of the wine industry shows an absolute maturity in picking up the ball and running with it rather than sitting and waiting for the government to hold their hand on the way through. They have determined that they will put it to the government to put this levy forward so that they can take their industry forward, reducing our national debt by exporting wines offshore and creating jobs in the turnaround through tourism and through the domestic industry. But the key element of this bill is that the introduction of a wine export charge will ensure that generic wine export promotion stays.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my discussions with some of the Hunter's well&hyphen;known vignerons&mdash;people like Brian McGuigan of McGuigans Wines, Chris Barnes, the President of the Hunter Valley Vineyard Association, and Murray Robson, the opening of whose new winery at Rothbury I will be attending this weekend, and Mr Tony Griffiths, the marketing manager of Port Stephens 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4357"> Wines&mdash;I know that they are of one accord and are supportive of the philosophy underpinning the outcomes of this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Pushing Australian wines forward as a generic brand is in their eyes something that will be of real benefit for them all to share. It will also benefit their shareholders and, more importantly, the Hunter, as Australian wines and Hunter wines continue to grab attention on the world stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst my electorate of Paterson borders the Hunter's official wine establishment, for the record it is worth noting that, whilst the Pokolbin district and the Upper Hunter receive the lion's share of the accolades, tourist visitations and focus on their wines, areas within my electorate have an historic and very real link to the vine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Port Stephens Wines is nestled at Bobs Farm within Port Stephens and has been an active winery since 1984. Its sandy soils, whilst not considered standard ground for grape growing, have a natural irrigation with a guaranteed yearly supply of water. After years of planned research, the temperate climate and the natural abundance of fresh, salt&hyphen;free bore water, are reaping them real dividends on the edge of the country's biggest tourist stage&mdash;that is, Port Stephens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will take this moment to digress. Their chardonnay is probably one of the best drops I have had the opportunity to drink. It is an excellent drop.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="GRACE" NAMEID="ZG4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A good drop, too.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LL6">Mr BOB BALDWIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad my friend over there, the honourable member for Fowler (Mr Grace), agrees with me on that. Tony Griffiths, of Port Stephens Wines, has also indicated how research has found that one of the first commercial wine producing ventures was actually  established in the Hunter. It was established at Williamtown, with the actual vineyards dating back to the 1830s in the Tahlee and nearby Tanilba Bay areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the riches in both the history and the quality of wines right across the Hunter region are well recognised not just within Australia but throughout the world stage. I would say, rather parochially, that the Hunter wines are the best in the world. The industry sector is recognised from the highest echelons of government&mdash;which was categorised no better than when the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) recently came to the Hunter Valley especially for the thanksgiving festival at the wine harvest dinner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I explained before, the value of the wine industry to the Hunter&mdash;to jobs growth; to fresh infrastructure investment, which is important across regional communities which are forever yearning for more income generation; and to enhancing our balance of payments bottom line&mdash;is very real. In seeking and chasing the vision, I do hope that the industry heads, the government and the players in the wine industry are observing that riding the bucking horse can also lead to you falling off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The wine industry has successfully sought to think outside the square. It has taken its thinking to a totally different dimension in seeking and pursuing active markets in the offshore region. It is important that it continues to innovate and that the government recognises and helps where it can to foster the change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last December David Combe, the senior vice&hyphen;president of Southcorp Wines's international business division, not only lauded the important role small wineries play in relation to the dominant big four national wine makers&mdash;which control close to 80 per cent of our market 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4358"> and production&mdash;but he called on industry awareness to raise a campaign to inject absolute quality Australian wines into the burgeoning Asian marketplace. His sentiments were:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The industry needs to rethink where its priorities are in terms of generic promotion campaigns and recognising that something very special is happening in Asia.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">His notoriety in the Australian political scene in the early 1980s should not be taken into account when considering such a statement, because he is right to keep the industry thinking totally ahead. His voice is not alone in the wilderness. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  newspaper on 9 December 1996, Wolf Blass raised similar sentiments. He said we should consider innovative ways of marketing surplus wines into the emerging Asian markets, including a revival of the pearl style sparkling wines which were popular some 30 years ago. I am sure we all remember Barossa Pearl and the sparkling wines that we all drank. I was a very young person, but perhaps some of my colleagues over there&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LL6">Mr BOB BALDWIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You were even younger? That is very good to see. Mr Blass says that the westernisation and rapid growth of the middle class in countries like China and Japan make the sweeter distinctly Australian pearl style wine, perhaps in a new screw&hyphen;top 200ml bottle style, an answer that could fulfil a niche market over there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On a regional front, the immense value that wine tourism provides should never ever be forgotten. The June 1995 report by a committee of inquiry into the wine grape and wine industry estimated that approximately 850 direct jobs were created in the Hunter's wine industry alone, maturing to some 1,200 jobs during the vintage period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most of these local jobs hinge on the numbers flocking from Sydney and interstate to the Hunter's world class wineries. Marketing wine tourism and escapism to outside visitors has  reaped great success, but I encourage our local wineries to not rest on their laurels. This has been supported by Hunter tourism in their initiative and push in promoting the Hunter as not just a wine region but a total region throughout Australia and to New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we need is even better service, enticements to sustain more sales from the cellar door, through better marketing and pricing, and the encouragement of overnight, weekend or even longer stays in the Hunter. That will provide more down the line employment and will build an even better reputation for the Hunter wineries. To want to be the best in business, you have to be the best in business, and I will obviously continue to encourage and seek to assist our Hunter wine industry in its endeavours to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Hunter wine industry has had some setbacks over the years. It has survived droughts and hailstorms but it continues. Whilst we all might be very parochial about our own individual wineries or regions and how good those blends are, the important focus here is that together, the Australian winery industry marches an assault on the overseas markets with our wines to show how good they are as a total concept.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) said in his speech, Australia has one very large competitive advantage in the offshore market beside the fact that we produce the best quality wines in the world, and that is that they are very price competitive. In offshore markets Australian wines tend to be in the lower to medium price range and perform a lot better in some of those markets. This has led to the high export values that we have achieved in offshore markets.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4359">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, we will continue to support the wine industry and I am glad to see that the opposition does support this Wine Export Charge Bill 1997 and the consequential amendments, and we look forward to seeing a growing, developing and maturing wine industry in Australia.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join with other members in supporting this legislation. As the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) explained in his second reading speech, the legislation is to involve the introduction of a charge on exports for Australian wine to assist in funding the wine export promotion infrastructure and program with the corporation currently funded by levies paid under the Wine Grapes Levy Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The introduction of a wine export charge will, in the Minister's words, ensure continued funding for generic wine export promotion. The charges are expected to raise about a million a year to fund the infrastructure and part of the promotion program for the Australian Wine Export Council.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister and other members speaking before me have indicated in this debate the very considerable success, particularly in recent times, of the Australian wine industry, and that is a success that all members of this parliament would want to continue to foster.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps, I could touch on a couple of very brief anecdotes and use them as lead&hyphen;ins to a couple of points I want to make about wine exports at the present time. In conjunction with a number of senators and members of both sides of this parliament, I visited Taiwan in an unofficial capacity last month. One of the things that was very noticeable on that particular visit to an Asian country, as compared with a number of earlier visits I had made, was that at banquets and other occasions, wine, particularly red wine was very much present and very clearly being enjoyed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was quite a stark contrast with previous occasions when it was always the pattern at a Chinese banquet of any sort that there would be fairly copious quantities of cognac or whisky&mdash;spirits&mdash;on the table. So, there has been, in my observation, anecdotally,&mdash;and I think it is probably supported by more systematic market research&mdash;a very significant shift in Asian tastes in terms of beverages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other anecdote I have to tell is not quite as encouraging. Whilst in Taipei I visited several wine shops. In those wine shops I had to look very hard to see Australian wines. The wines that were being promoted at the front of the shops were French wines and some other European wines. Eventually, in a couple wine shops I visited, I found some Australian wine stuck down the back of the shop without any obvious promotion. I suppose that reinforces the need for some of the exercises that are proposed in this bill&mdash;although, there is a qualification on that that I want to make. I flew on Eva Air, a Taiwan owned airline, in and out of Australia. No Australian wines were being served, only excellent French and Californian wines. Certainly, anecdotally, there is a great way for us to go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What troubles me about how that challenge in Asia is being addressed&mdash;the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin) referred to it&mdash;is that Austrade and the Australian Wine Export Council currently conduct, according to their literature, generic promotional programs in the UK, Ireland, Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, Scandinavia, USA and Canada. There are no Asian cities there. The literature also talks about distributors. The Australian Wine Export Council has offices in London, Frankfurt, New York and, under contractual arrangements with 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4360"> Austrade offices, in Vancouver, Toronto, Stockholm and Copenhagen. Unless my geography is a singular failure, there are no Asian countries there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When one looks at the 1995&hyphen;96 annual report of the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation, and at the overseas visitors being sponsored to Australia, one can see that someone came in April 1996 from Thailand, some people came in June 1996 from Japan and a wine writer came from Singapore. But, overwhelmingly, the visitors that presumably were sponsored by the corporation to visit Australia, as part of the promotion of our wines, were not from Asia; they were from Europe or North America.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the overseas travel of staff from Australia of the corporation. In December 1995, the general manager travelled to the US and Europe. In January and February of 1996, he travelled to the UK and Europe. There were no visits to Asia. I do not know whether the corporation was represented in the last month or so at the Hofex exhibition in Hong Kong. I am told that that is the major food and drink expo in Asia so it would be very useful to know whether Australia was officially represented at that. If we were not, frankly, it is a disgrace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point I am trying to make is that not enough is being done in terms of the relative priorities in promoting Asia. The latest ABS figures I have show that Europe and North America are certainly more significant markets at the present time. On my reading of the figures, which I have done fairly quickly&mdash;I have not had any opportunity to do any detailed analysis&mdash;the rate of growth in both South&hyphen;East Asia and north&hyphen;east Asia is dramatically greater, admittedly off a somewhat lower base.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That would seem to me to add very considerable strength to the argument that in this new fund for generic promotion particular emphasis ought to be given to Asian markets, without neglecting other markets. If my anecdote is correct about the shift under way in Asian drinking patterns, the potential gains there are very substantial indeed. That is not to say that it will be easy. A number of speakers have referred to the very excellent 2025 strategy plan prepared by the industry. That strategy plan, amongst other things, makes the comment that industry and government must work closely to dismantle the prohibitive tariff and taxation regimes which prevail in a large number of Asian markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have had a very brief look at some of those barriers. For example, on the information I have, Hong Kong imposes a 100 per cent duty on alcoholic beverages. Japan operates, and I guess this is common with a number of other countries, a preferential system of duty which very much benefits countries such as Chile, as a competitor. From this information, countries such as Chile are regarded as less developed countries and therefore have a reduced or non&hyphen;applicable rate of duty applied by Japan. It seems to me that we ought to take up the particular observation in the strategy report about the need for aggressive action by both the industry and the government in Australia to ensure that prohibitive barriers or distortions of trade with Asian countries are addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to Japan, I think the benefits there are very substantial. I obtained from the library yesterday a press clipping from a Jiji Press service in Japan dated 28 November 1996 entitled `Wine imports growing at heady pace.' It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Wine from around the world is flowing into Japan at an intoxicating pace, according to the Yokohama Customhouse. Last year, total wine imports through Yokohama Port . . . topped 10 billion yen for the first time ever, rising to an estimated 11,196 million yen, the port authority said.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4361"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the first nine months of this year, the volume of imported wine increased 9.9 pct over the same period last year. . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That reinforces the observations I made about Asian patterns. It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">France lead exporters with a 24.5 pct share of the local imported wine market. Next came Argentina with about 18.1 pct, Germany with 14.2 pct, Chile with 8.2 pct, Bulgaria with 7.4 pct and Italy with 7 pct, the authority said. Imports from South Africa and Chile have grown particularly fast, it said.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Wouldn't you know it, there was not a single mention of Australia! That reinforces the second anecdote I told about the need for some attention to the priorities of where we are putting our effort. It is not only a matter in relation to Taiwan or Hong Kong, it is a matter in relation to Japan as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another observation I wanted to make arising out of the strategy report that I referred to earlier was a comment about the competitive edge that the Australian wine industry has. Before politicians get too involved with self-congratulation, it makes this particularly important remark:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Its greatest threat to competitiveness is a lack of government support. Halliday&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">which is presumably the wine commentator&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">points out that the federal bureaucracy is strongly antipathetic to the industry and Federal politicians are neutral. This is backed up by a punitive tax system and little facilitative support.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It goes on and says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">State governments are seen as more supportive</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In the context of the strategy plan it refers to a range of taxation and other measures that the industry wants government to address.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is a very salutary point to note in this particular debate because whilst all contributors to this debate want to see the industry flourish, we are being told pretty clearly by the industry that in its view, inadequate government support is a major threat to its competitiveness. That competitiveness, as other speakers have indicated, is absolutely crucial. We face competition from the traditional European wine nations, and there is a very substantial threat from South America, particularly from Chile, and from South African wines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst I endorse the remarks that have been made by other speakers in this debate, it seems to me that we ought to be ensuring that the appropriate bodies, the corporation and its offshoots, really put a little more attention on their marketing in Asia. We ought to be seeking more adequate explanations as to why Asia is not apparently receiving the attention that it would seem to deserve in that exercise. We ought to very much take to heart the comments of the industry in its strategy plan that government support is, in its view, still inadequate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There will not be anyone in the House surprised to see me rise to participate in this cognate debate on the Wine Export Charge Bill 1997, although I must say I make that comment with a touch of irony because I grew up in a teetotal house in which the consumption of alcohol was unknown. My experience of this industry is something that I have had to acquire as the federal member for the electorate of Wakefield.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As most members in the chamber will be aware, Wakefield incorporates the Barossa Valley, the Riverland and parts of the Clare Valley, thereby making it one of South Australia's most 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4362"> enviable electorates. That means, of course, that there are lots of people who would gladly have a job like mine, representing an industry as prominent as it is in my electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sorry the member for Maribyrnong (Mr Sercombe) has had to leave the chamber&mdash;no doubt he has a legitimate reason for that&mdash;because he made a number of remarks that I would particularly like to focus on. He was critical of what he saw as government apathy towards the wine industry. They were remarks that particularly bristled with me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an industry that has been prominent in the Australian federal parliament and in its representation for almost as long as it has been in existence. I well recall that, when I entered this place in 1983, this was an industry facing a number of what were seen to be overproduction problems. By 1984, those overproduction problems had become so acute that the government of the day agreed to a vine pull scheme in order to remove some of the surplus production, principally in reds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a bit rich for the member for Maribyrnong to come in here and eyeball a 14&hyphen;month old government and suggest that it has done too little, when in 1983, when the Liberal and National parties lost power, there was no tax on the wine industry. Mark that.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="GRACE" NAMEID="ZG4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZG4">Mr Ted Grace</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And no exports.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HE4">Mr ANDREW</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And no exports&mdash;I will gladly pick up the point of the member for Fowler (Mr Grace). It is a matter that I am more than happy to address, but he might care to bear in mind my statement that there was no tax on the wine industry in 1983&hyphen;84, a position that had been proudly defended by my predecessor, the honourable Geoffrey O'Halloran Giles.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The industry had a vine pull scheme funded by the government. I freely concede that to the member for Fowler. But it also was followed in its recovery by a tax of 10 per cent, in spite of the assurances of the government of the day that that would not happen and, subsequently, another tax of 20 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am one representing an industry&mdash;the member for Fowler will be interested to note&mdash;who did not vote against that tax, because I thought it was impossible to continue to have an alcoholic beverage industry that did not carry some tax bill. I stand here and quite frankly say I did not oppose that measure. It is a bit rich for the member for Maribyrnong to come in here and accuse us of not doing enough when what the former government did was burden this industry with a greater tax load than it had ever known before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Fowler interjected, `And no exports', and he is quite right. The industry, facing a vine pull scheme and a government taxation measure, determined to do what it should have done decades ago: that is pull together and develop an export strategy. In many ways, no thanks to the former government and no thanks to this government at this point in time, the industry has put together an export package that, as previous speakers have indicated, is the envy of most other industries in Australia, particularly primary industries. That package has had a real export focus. That package has thrived because the industry pulled together. The success of that package had nothing to do with the former government and a great deal to do with industry determination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is an irony that the member for Fowler has pointed out. The irony is that the tax went on and the industry thrived&mdash;not precisely what the government or the industry of the day predicted, but that was the end result. There is also an irony in the car industry, if I may digress, in that the government lowered the tariffs from 70 per cent to what is targeted to be 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4363"> 15 per cent, and the industry developed an export base that it previously had never imagined. But that is not the matter before the chair. The matter before the chamber right now is the question of what the wine industry does into the future, how it equips itself for the future, and what it sees as its likely export success into the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not surprisingly, every speaker has mentioned the strategy 2025, the wine industry's plan which is very much the result of their having looked at their targets, potential markets and production in Australia and said, `This is what we can do with the reputation we have developed over the last decade as an effective export industry in Australia.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are incredible figures. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 10 April 1997 said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The United States continues to provide a lucrative outlet for Australian wine with the average export price to the US of $5.21 per litre substantially higher than the $3.45 per litre achieved in the United Kingdom. Sales to the United Kingdom rose 32.5 per cent in volume to 74.8 million litres and 30 per cent in value to $258.2 million in the year to March 31. Sales to the United States rose 34.8 per cent in volume to 20.7 million litres and 48.8 per cent in value to $107.8 million in the same period.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is a quite unprecedented success story and the industry has wisely come to this government and said, `What can we do to in some way ensure that that success continues?' They have come to us seeking the opportunity to have a wine export charge levied against the industry and this government has agreed. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It would be fair to say that the government's agreement did not come instantly. Not because we wished in any way to frustrate the wine industry but because of two concerns that the government had. One was that the export charge may not necessarily be supported by the entire industry and the other that the export charge could be construed as a tax being placed on the industry. But the industry has made it perfectly clear to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) and to the government that this is a charge that is supported by almost the entire industry and that they do not construe it as a tax. There is an opportunity for them to work together from one revenue base with an eye to expanding export markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This year alone, the wine industry&mdash;a point I am sure the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) will want to make&mdash;will in fact generate something like $634 million in exports which is double that of two years ago and well on target to the $1 billion that they are hoping to reach by the year 2001.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much has been made in this debate by the member for Maribyrnong of what he saw as the failure of the wine industry in Australia to make any inroads into the Asian markets. He recognised the progress that had been made in the UK and more latterly in the USA but he was critical of what he saw as a lack of aggression on the part of the wine industry in getting into the Asian market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the member for Maribyrnong fails to recognise is that whether we are in fact dealing as he did, with Taiwan, or with Japan, much of the difficulty that Australian exporters&mdash;not just the wine industry, but Australian exporters generally&mdash;have with the Asian market is the whole question of market access. Market access is denied them because in fact the countries do not want additional competition in their wine industry. The reason that the parliament&mdash;and I emphasise `the parliament'&mdash;has stuck by the WTO arrangements, conveniently ignored I must add by the Australian Democrats and some of the independents, is so that the parliament will be able to offer to all export industries, including the wine industry, better market access. It is quite true to say that in the wine area, as in any other export area, we do not have a level playing field&mdash;everyone knows that. But in fact as a result of the negotiations over the last decade, the playing field is more level than it has been in the lifetime of the member for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4364"> Fowler (Mr Grace) or myself. That is to the credit of the parliament. It is to the credit of the government that in opposition we did not criticise the then government and the steps they were taking to level out the playing field. I would be a little less acidic in my remarks if I did not have the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) now criticising us for doing the very things in world trade that we supported him in doing when he was in government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that the playing field is not level and we do not have the market access we would like in Asia&mdash;the very point made by the member for Maribyrnong. But that market access will only be gained as we abide by the rules of the WTO and that is bound to mean that there are some countries with tariff rates higher than we have. We do not like that and we cannot negotiate our way out of it as the member for Maribyrnong called on us to do as the previous speaker in this debate. We cannot negotiate our way out of it because, even in the wine industry, we are barely two per cent of world trade. We need to bear that in mind. We are not the tail on the end of the dog. We are scarcely even the flea on the end of the tail. We have no leverage in world markets. The best we can do is negotiate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The WTO is part of that negotiating process. Much of the difficulty that the Australian industry has in getting a toehold in Asia is principally a result of the fact that we are not enjoying the market access there that we are in Europe and the USA. The risk we run when we want to modify the rules under the WTO that we have agreed to as a parliament is the risk of being denied the relatively free access that we have into the markets of the UK and the USA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill before the chamber is a bill that has been supported by the industry. That is significant because the big four in the industry&mdash;and we are not talking about banks now, but about Orlando&hyphen;Wyndham, Southcorp, Mildara&hyphen;Blass and BRL Hardy&mdash;occupy 80 per cent of the wine industry's production in Australia. There was a real concern that this bill might merely facilitate them and not the smaller winemakers. But the smaller winemakers have  indicated, by and large, their support for this bill as well, so the industry can be seen to offer an aggressive and cohesive approach to export market development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The future of the Australian wine industry and, as a result, its capacity to generate export income for the Australian community depends entirely on the way the industry performs in the export markets. This bill is in place to facilitate that and I am pleased to support it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8K6">Mr FITZGIBBON</NAME><ELECTORATE> (Hunter)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(12.42 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No&hyphen;one in this place will be surprised to see me, like the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew), seeking an opportunity to speak on the Wine Export Charge Bill, because the electorate I represent has within it some of the finest winemakers in the world. I think that is a point that is indisputable. That activity not only takes place in the Lower Hunter region these days, but has also grown very quickly in the Upper Hunter, so the Hunter is increasingly becoming a major player in the winemaking industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a very strong and undisputed link between the health of Australia's wine industry and the health of Australia's tourism industry. That is a link that is very important in my electorate. Towns like Cessnock, for example, which traditionally relied upon coalmining as its economic base, have increasingly come to rely on tourism for economic wealth and therefore for survival. So the very strong link between the health of the wine industry and the health of the tourism industry therefore means there is a very strong link between the health of the wine industry and the health of my local economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also an important relationship between the health of the wine industry and our ability to break into overseas markets. As many earlier speakers have indicated, at the moment 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4365"> our winemakers are exporting their heads off. Winemakers in my immediate area, like the Drayton family, the Tyrrells and of course the McGuigan company, have been very innovative and, indeed, very energetic in their approach to opening up new export markets for their family companies. Not only that, in the Upper Hunter we have Rosemount, which I think exports about 50 per cent of all wine it produces. So the Hunter is also becoming increasingly very prominent in the export industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the Australian industry penetration into international markets is to continue to grow, the industry will need assistance. This bill does provide that extra push. I am pleased with the bipartisanship being displayed on this issue&mdash;it is almost a little scary; you do not see it too often&mdash;although I note that the member for Wakefield and the member for Maribyrnong (Mr Sercombe) have had a word or two to say to one another. I am sorry that I missed a large part of the member for Maribyrnong's speech. But there has been a healthy bipartisan approach and I am delighted to stand here and lend my support to this government bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The export charge, of course, will raise about $1 million each year and will go a long way towards assisting the industry reach its objectives, as outlined in its document known as <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Strategy 2025</EMPHASIS> that I have heard a number of speakers refer to. The money will not only help the industry increase its current export markets but, of course, will assist it in establishing new export markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to the document, by the year 2001 the industry hopes to increase its share of the German market by some 33 per cent, the Japanese market by 29 per cent, the US market by 16 per cent, the Swedish by 15 per cent and the UK market which of course is our largest export market, by around seven per cent. I recommend the document <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Strategy 2025</EMPHASIS> to all those with an interest in the industry. It is innovative, it shows vision, and it shows that this really is an industry prepared to help itself and get out there amongst it. It shows that it is not  prepared to sit back and rely only on government assistance when attempting to establish additional export markets and expand its existing markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To move away from bipartisanship for just a moment, I could not understand why last year, in its first budget, the Howard government decided to simply chop the final payment due to winegrowers which was a compensation payment instituted by the former government to compensate for the changes in the tax regime as it applied to the wine industry. That saving to the government was only about $3.5 million, but to each of the individual winegrowers in my region, and in every other region around the country, it represented a loss of some $6,000&mdash;hardly the sort of incentive we are looking to give them at this particular time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I want to digress just a little and talk very briefly about one very innovative project in the pipeline in my electorate, and that is an attempt to run water through a pipeline from the Hunter River into the Pokolbin area. One of the greatest difficulties the Pokolbin winegrowers have is the lack of water which, of course, impacts upon their ability to increase their volume. The project is an exciting venture that is valued at about $8 million. Again, it is a scheme that does not rely on government assistance. It is proposed to be put in place through either a cooperative&mdash;comprising a number of winegrowers and, therefore, investors in the region&mdash;or the bankable option.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bankable option involves an outside investor. It is a more highly engineered scheme, and is a low risk but secure scheme. I recommend it to ministers of the government who, no doubt, will be asked to express an interest in it. I recommend that they give it their support in any way that they can. This is potentially a scheme that could have enjoyed assistance under 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4366"> the infrastructure bonds scheme&mdash;the scheme that we have effectively just seen abolished and replaced by a scheme that relates only to land, transport and infrastructure projects. That is disappointing and I would have thought this was a very worthy scheme that could have fitted very nicely into that scheme that has just been abolished. However, I do ask ministers to look favourably on any request for assistance that might be sought from the government in relation to the project for the Pokolbin area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once again, I am delighted that on this issue there has been a large degree of bipartisanship. This is a very important industry to Australia. It is a burgeoning export industry and a very important industry to my electorate. I am delighted that we see members on both sides of the House working closely together to ensure a healthy future for it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Wine Export Charge Bill 1997 is to introduce, at the request of the wine industry, a charge on exports to assist in funding the wine export promotion infrastructure and program of the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation. The corporation's statutory responsibilities include wine promotion, wine export control, the wine label integrity program, and determining Australia's geographical indications for use in describing and presenting wine. The Australian wine industry has asked that the bill be introduced because, as successful as the industry has been in exporting wine, there will be a continuing need for generic wine export promotion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) said in his second reading speech, the Australian wine industry is currently enjoying unprecedented international recognition and is achieving rapid growth in exports. It needs repeating that, between 1985&hyphen;86 and 1995&hyphen;96, exports grew more than 10&hyphen;fold in value from 11 million litres worth $21 million, to 130 million litres worth $471 million. While Australian wines may be found in many countries, Australia's major export markets are Europe, North America and New Zealand. An  indication of the rapid increase is that exports in 1996 totalling 148 million litres were valued at $551 million&mdash;an increase over the previous year of 28 per cent by volume and 36 per cent by value.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill gives me the opportunity to speak about a wine producing area that has in the past obtained very little recognition. I am pleased to see, however, that over the past several years, this situation has started to change, mainly due to the quality of grapes produced and the quality of the special vintages of the area&mdash;quality that can no longer be denied. There are a number of well&hyphen;known wineries within the Riverina, and the names may surprise some people: De Bortoli Wines, Casella Wines, Cranswick Estate Wines, Lillypilly Estate Wines, McWilliams Wines, Miranda Wines, Orlando Wines, Riverina Wines, Rossetto Wines, Southcorp Wines, Toorak Wines, West End Wines, Stanbridge Estate Wines and, of course, Charles Sturt University. I may have missed a few, and I apologise for that. There are also a number of boutique wineries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to report that the 1997 vintage in the MIA has ended on a high note, with the May rains starting noble rot running in late hanging semillon grapes. This noble rot will produce yet another line of sweet Riverina wine that has become internationally famous. While in the MIA a vintage of around 125,000 tonnes was hoped for, a lesser amount of 118,000 tonnes was achieved. This was still pleasing, given that it was a record vintage. According to the Wine Grapes Marketing Board chairman, Mr Gary Smellie, all the grapes were taken; most of the winemakers obtained the fruit they wanted; and growers obtained good prices for working hard to produce better quality grapes.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4367">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In speaking of the New South Wales Grapes Marketing Board, I am pleased to see that its term has been extended for three years by the State Minister for Agriculture, Richard Amery. This extension has been welcomed by wine grape growers and it followed a review of the vesting powers of the board; but the government at the end of the day accepted that having a statutory authority in place did not disadvantage wine consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Wine Grape Marketing Board has in recent years brought about harmony and stability in the wine industry during an unprecedented growth phase. Grape prices that peaked in the 1995&hyphen;96 vintage&mdash;fuelled by international demand for Australian wine&mdash;were sustained and climbed to new heights during the 1997 vintage, due to winemaker competition for premium fruit. However, the 1997 national grape tonnage fell from an estimated 900,000 tonnes to only about 800,000 tonnes. This fall has created a scramble for grapes, especially premium whites and all reds, which were in very short supply. The problem for the Wine Grapes Marketing Board may come once more favourable seasonal conditions return across all grape producing regions, and there may be a surplus of unfashionable grapes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Along with the growing of rice, fruit and vegetables, wine production is a key industry within the Riverina and, more particularly, the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area. Wine grape production in the MIA accounts for almost 13 per cent of Australia's yield. Apart from the actual wineries, there are many spin&hyphen;offs that assist the local communities. An example is A&amp;G Industries, a company in Griffith that is recognised as a world leader in the manufacture and installation of state&hyphen;of&hyphen;the&hyphen;art stainless steel winemaking equipment. I understand they are one of the largest users of stainless steel in Australia, and their products are exported throughout the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Charles Sturt University, located in Wagga Wagga, is already famous for its wine science and viticultural courses, which have trained many of Australia's top winemakers, who  are now making a name for themselves in this nation and overseas. The university not only provides courses for Australians, but also is involved in distance education in other parts of the world including&mdash;would you believe&mdash;Portugal. The winery attached to the university has, over the past several years, produced some excellent medal winning wines and is recognised by the emblem of Sturt's desert pea on its label.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Charles Sturt University and other learning centres throughout Australia are pivotal in ensuring that Australia is recognised as a nation that produces quality wines. The advances in techniques using modern science are giving Australia an advantage in quality wine production that we must seek to maintain if we are to continue to be successful in placing our wines on the world market. While Australian trained wine makers are now spread throughout the world, it is hoped that the edge we have developed will be maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As most Australians, particularly wine lovers, would know, family companies are the life blood of an industry, and some families have been making wine for five generations. This may not be a long time by European standards. I remember talking to a gentleman on a train going between Florence and Rome one day whose family had been making candy since Christopher Columbus travelled to the Americas. Nevertheless, by Australian benchmarks, it shows a wealth of experience and knowledge handed down through the generations, to which is added the new technologies developed through institutions like Charles Sturt University.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of these family wineries within the Riverina to boast five generations is that of the famous McWilliams family. Not only are they good corporate citizens, but their contribution to the community within the MIA is legendary. Three generation families are also evident, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4368"> some of the better known ones being the De Bortolis and Mirandas, who are in the top 10 largest wineries in Australia and still find time to support local communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We who live in the Riverina are very proud of the food and the beverages that the area produces. On Saturday, 14 June a dinner is to be held in Wagga Wagga to celebrate that fact. At the dinner, the Golden Plate Awards will be presented to recognise this excellence in the food and beverage industry of the Riverina. The dinner is being organised by the Riverina Food Group, which is one of Australia's peak food networks, comprising companies in the Riverina region who produce and process food and beverage products. Formed in 1993, the Riverina Food Group is an initiative of local producers, the Riverina Regional Development Board and the Chamber of Manufacturers of New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The chairman of the group, Louis Marangon of Griffith, has stated that the awards presented have two objectives: firstly, to highlight the achievements of food and beverage producers and manufacturers in the Riverina; secondly, to give local people a taste of the wonderful diversity of food and wines the Riverina has to offer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Riverina Gold Plate Awards, which are being presented for the first time, will give the community the opportunity to recognise the efforts of the producers and manufacturers who have contributed to the success of the Riverina in its production of fine food and fine wine. By holding functions such as this, it is hoped the quality of both the food and wines of the Riverina will become more widely known and their quality appreciated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to congratulate the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation on the work it does, including wine promotion, wine export control, the wine label integrity program and determining Australia's geographical indications for use in describing and presenting wine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, may I say the wine industry is a good example of what Australian initiative and drive can do in promoting and successfully marketing Australian products on a highly  competitive international market. It is an example that many industries could follow and the industry deserves congratulations. I would particularly like to congratulate all involved in wine grape production, wine making and associated industries in the Riverina and throughout Australia, who add so much to the prosperity of our Riverina region and to the prosperity of Australia. I strongly support the bill.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) No.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) I have undertaken one overseas trip. The cost of my travel was $14,135. This amount includes accommodation, meals, telephone and fax calls, airfares, passport costs, baggage insurance, ground

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consistent with Government policy, I look to the opportunity to use frequent flyer points to offset the cost of official travel wherever possible, and will continue to do so. The opportunity to redeem points, however, is restricted by the airlines' conditions e.g. not all flights have seats available for frequent flyer use, not all destinations can be reached using a specific carrier and their partner airlines, and there are `block out' periods by the airlines (peak times) when no seats are available.</PARA>
