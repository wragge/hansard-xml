<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The National Transmission Network Sale Bill 1997, together with the National Transmission Network (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1997, implement the government's decision announced in the last budget to sell the National Transmission Network.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the election we announced that we would increase the national broadcasters' responsibility for transmission of their programs. These bills provide the ABC and SBS with a direct commercial relationship with transmission service providers. The ABC and SBS have been seeking such a relationship for many years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sale of the transmission network will provide a range of benefits. The ABC and SBS, and other network users, will finally operate in a purchaser&hyphen;provider relationship with service suppliers. Transferring this operational activity to the private sector will produce the scope for greater client focus and responsiveness that flows from normal commercial practice. In addition, it sets the scene for a greater degree of competition in the transmission services market, particularly with the introduction of digital terrestrial broadcasting. Sale proceeds will be used to further reduce the public debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In agreeing to sell the network, the government recognised the importance of safeguarding important broadcasting policy objectives. We have made it clear that the maintenance of existing ABC and SBS coverage and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> service quality, particularly for regional and remote communities, is a prerequisite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, we will ensure that existing community service obligations will be preserved, including those for network users such as Radio for the Print Handicapped, remote commercial satellite broadcasting services, self&hyphen;help retransmission groups and emergency service operators.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the medium term, we recognise that there is likely to remain limited competition in the transmission services market, especially outside major metropolitan centres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Against this background, these bills balance the desire to maximise the benefits of establishing commercial synergies with the need for competitive safeguards to protect the government's broadcasting and social policy objectives. The network will be transferred to one or more national transmission companies which will have agreed contracts with the ABC and SBS spelling out transmission requirements. These companies will be sold to the network purchaser, or purchasers, with the contracts in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A compact with the ABC and SBS will spell out the government's transmission coverage and quality expectations&mdash;in return for full funding of the costs of the broadcasters' five year transmission contracts. The onus will therefore be on the ABC, SBS and other users to ensure that adequate and appropriate transmission services are obtained to meet their needs. The bills provide a regulatory framework to underpin these contractual arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is necessary to ensure the continuity of contractual arrangements in the event of on&hyphen;sale of the network, and to safeguard against the transfer of assets necessary for the continuation of ABC, SBS, Radio for the Print Handicapped services and emergency services. Accordingly, this bill contains provisions requiring ministerial approval before transfer of any assets associated with these `nominated services'. This requirement will enable the minister to ensure that the proposed transferee adopts the conditions of the previous contracts with the ABC, SBS, and Radio for the Print Handicapped operators in relation to their core performance obligations. The provision 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10208"> will also allow an assessment of the likely commercial or financial viability of the proposed transferee to further safeguard the continued provision of national broadcasting services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation also provides for an access regime similar to that put in place for the telecommunications industry for the benefit of certain nominated customers. The access regime will guard against any imbalance in negotiating power, which could have led to essential transmission services and facilities not being available, or only being available at monopoly prices. The access regime will:</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> guarantee access to transmission services for the ABC, SBS and the Radio for the Print Handicapped operators, and will</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> guarantee access to existing Network sites and towers for groups such as community broadcasters, self&hyphen;help retransmission groups, remote commercial satellite broadcasters and emergency services, as well as the ABC, SBS and Radio for the Print Handicapped.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">If the parties are unable to reach agreement on the terms and conditions to apply, they will have recourse to the ACCC to arbitrate the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This combination of contractual and legislative provisions will balance the likely market power of new network owners to ensure continued access by national broadcasters and other nominated users on reasonable terms and conditions. Commercial users of the network will have recourse to standard fair trading legal safeguards, including those under Part 3A of the Trade Practices Act 1974.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new arrangements also require a number of technical changes to other portfolio legislation. The National Transmission Network (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1997, which I am about to introduce, amends the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983, the Special Broadcasting Service Act 1991 and the Radiocommunications Act 1992 to allow the broadcasters to deal directly with transmission service providers, and to enable the ABC and SBS to maintain control over the Radiocommunications spectrum used to broadcast their services.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ABC and SBS will also be able to establish their own transmission services. This power, together with the ability of the broadcasters to purchase future requirements from other providers, will provide commercial leverage and introduce contestability into the market. The ABC and SBS will report to the parliament, through their annual reports, on any significant changes in transmission coverage or quality of national broadcasting services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ABC and SBS will be responsible for dealing with any complaints from the public about reception quality. In the unlikely event that a suitable and timely response is not provided by the broadcasters, and a substantial problem appears to exist in relation to changed transmission coverage of a community, the minister will have the option of directing the Australian Broadcasting Authority (ABA) to investigate the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With this contractual and legislative package, the ABC and SBS will at last have a direct commercial relationship with the provider of their transmission services and a degree of flexibility in determining how best to meet their future transmission needs. At the same time, the Australian public can be confident that coverage and signal quality for national broadcasting services will be protected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, self&hyphen;help groups, emergency service operators, and remote commercial satellite service providers will be protected by the access regime. Capped charges in contracts or supplementary funding will ensure that they are not financially disadvantaged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The  National Transmission Network Sale Bill 1997 also contains some technical requirements to facilitate the sale. These include provisions to ensure, if necessary, that ownership of fixtures can be separated from ownership of the land on which they are located. Some transmission facilities have been built on non&hyphen;Commonwealth land and the power to `sever' the fixtures from the land is needed to make it clear that the Commonwealth is the owner of network assets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill also ensures that the new network owner will not be subject to state and territory planning and environmental laws for facilities 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10209"> existing or under development at the time of the sale. Of course, a new owner will be subject to all planning and environmental requirements for new facilities or substantial changes to existing ones.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sale proceeds are expected to return to the budget in 1998&hyphen;99 as an offset to outlays. The government has agreed that total outlays for transmission services after the sale will be contained within current forward estimates. No additional resources are required for the negligible financial impact of administering the regulatory arrangements contained in these bills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These bills will allow the timely completion of the sale of the transmission network. As promised, the government will deliver the benefits of a more commercial transmission environment and give the national broadcasters the direct responsibility for transmission of their programs which they have sought for a very long time. I can certainly testify to that. At the same time, the bills will provide the safeguards necessary to preserve the government's national broadcasting and other social policy objectives. I have pleasure in commending the bill to the House, and I present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is some 19&half; hours since I commenced this speech prior to question time yesterday. A range of other activities in the House, such as consideration of the native title legislation, has led to my making a short speech but over a very long period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10210">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nonetheless, the  Public Service Bill , which I rise to speak on today, is a very major reform. But, as I mentioned yesterday, it is a major reform which has some serious question marks over it. There are elements of this bill which I think will not have the desired effect, and there are circumstances around which the operation of the Public Service, as it currently has worked for many years, could be severely compromised. A range of amendments are foreshadowed by the member for Canberra (Mr McMullan), which I think do try to address those concerns and ensure that those consequences&mdash;that to some may be unintended and to some intended&mdash;of the changes proposed by the government can be ameliorated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I mentioned yesterday, the Public Accounts Committee, of which I am deputy chair, considered this matter in a report and made a number of suggestions of changes to the government. As I understand it, they have practically all been accepted. In some respects, the government has even gone further than we recommended. I commend the government for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I also said yesterday, there was a tense atmosphere during the production of that report, given the intensely controversial nature of aspects of the legislation, but members of the committee from both sides of the House worked constructively together to produce a report with unanimous recommendations. The decision was taken that it would be better to agree to disagree on some of the issues of the bill rather than to have a minority report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that, one issue which came through clearly which the then chair of the committee and now Minister for Regional Development, Territories and Local Government, the honourable member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay), I and others spoke about when this report was tabled was a concern we have on not only this matter but also other matters in recent times regarding the moving of legislation to the Public Accounts Committee for consideration. By putting time lines on it which suits its program and are required for its legislative program, the government has created a situation where the committee is not 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> having enough time to properly consider matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report was a good report, but we were quite rushed in the consideration of it. There was a range of issues which I think we could have gone into in more detail but, given the time lines we had, that was not possible. We also had a continuing situation in that committee of a lack of resources which made it very unfair for the secretariat of the committee and also committee members to ensure a proper consideration of legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of bills in recent times have been referred by the government to the committee. I do not disagree with that as an approach&mdash;I think it is a sensible thing to do&mdash;but when you use the committee system in order to ensure that legislation is scrutinised you must, by definition, if you are serious about it, ensure that the committee has the time to properly consider legislation and also the resources so that it can ensure that its deliberations are effective and timely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of issues are raised, as I mentioned, about this legislation. I would like to go through a few concerns that the opposition has regarding the detail of the legislation. For example, the Prime Minister and ministers will be able to negotiate salary and conditions for agency heads and these will not be subject to public scrutiny. That in itself raises some questions regarding the operation of the system as it currently stands and what those adjustments will mean. It is true, and I am the first to admit, that the situation with agency heads&mdash;departmental secretaries&mdash;has changed significantly over the last 15 years. We now do not have permanent life tenure but long-term contract periods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are regulations&mdash;some sameness, if you like&mdash;about remuneration and also scales and schedules that are worked off. The situation here could well lead to massive differences in pay for incredibly similar jobs and to circumstances where the issue of remuneration and other conditions will not be subject to public scrutiny. That has been a very important aspect of Public Service operation in this country since the turn of the century. In addition to that, agency heads will have the power to hire and fire and determine salary 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10211"> and conditions for agency employees. They will have the power to revoke and amend determinations which give effect to conditions of service which have been negotiated and agreed between the government and APS employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The concern here is quite obvious. I suspect we will see a situation where people will be doing the same job in different departments within the service being paid vastly different wages and conditions. I do not think that in itself is fair or equitable. There are also concerns about a system which is not only fair and reasonable but also seen to be fair and reasonable. I think there are some real concerns here as to how this system will now operate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senior Executive Service officers will not even have recourse to the unfair dismissal provisions of the Workplace Relations Act. Again, there are issues here around the question of natural justice; there are issues here around the conditions of employment. I know that some would argue that, at that level, any employee ought to be judged entirely on their merit, but merit in itself is a difficult term in terms of definition and it can mean many things to many different people. I suspect that when you are talking about merit with respect to an employer with their employee the question of merit will be judged not necessarily on entirely meritorious conditions. When you remove someone's right to recourse on issues such as unfair dismissal, you raise questions of natural justice and also of institutional fairness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, a vast range of responsibilities will be devolved to agency heads which will result in increased differentiation, competition and rivalry between departments and much duplication of administrative procedures. This goes back to the issue of how, when you, if you like, move down the line and devolve, that devolution will work. In something as large as the Public Service in which, in many respects, similar jobs are being done in similar areas across many different departments, there could be unnecessary duplication which could lead to us not having an effective operation of the service.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The impact of all of these things will be the cessation of the APS as a career service. Because there has been a range of senior people and, in the more junior ranks, people who have been in departments or in the service for 20, 30 or 40 years, that has been an advantage in the past in building up a corporate memory&mdash;an understanding of how an organisation works and a build&hyphen;up of experience. In some respects, it is no different to what happens with an experienced fitter and turner or someone who is experienced in the retail trade area. The skills they gain over time just by doing the job are a necessary and valued aspect of their work performance. Experience is often a key consideration for employers in the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> As people move in and out of the APS&mdash;and I for one think there should be an element of that&mdash;the danger is that over time that corporate memory will be lost and that institutional understanding, which is a crucial part of the way the service works, will be jeopardised in a very serious manner. The Merit Protection (Australian Government Employees) Act is being repealed and with it all of the current mechanisms for review of employment decisions affecting APS employees. We also have some real concerns about that. Mobility rights, such as those of APS employees who are employed under the Members of Parliament (Staff) Act, can be removed after a 12-month transitional period, thus limiting the movement of staff between the Public Service and Parliament House and the benefits to both institutions which have flowed from this movement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not all one way on this question of corporate memory. There is now scope for mobility to occur in related fields. There is a view from the government that mobility in some respects will increase through this legislation, but I think the results may be quite different when we get to the actual operation of this system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> This legislation does raise some general concerns about what this government's attitude is to the Public Service. What does the government see as the role of the Public Service in the operation of government? The government has talked about the need for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10212"> greater efficiency; the government has talked about the need for a merit based approach. For example, APS values are inserted in the legislation as a basis for reviewing, considering and working through the operation of the service. I think that in itself is a good idea, but going for that approach under a piece of legislation which in effect removes a lot of the fundamental underpinning of the circumstances and the rights of Public Service employees will in itself create some real difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> One of the witnesses who appeared before the JCPA was Sir Lenox Hewitt. He is a former distinguished public servant, a man who has served successive governments over many years. His concerns on some of these issues were concerns that many of us on this side of the House certainly identified with and some of his concerns were also taken up by some members of the government in their report consideration. His main concern, basically put, was on the question of frank and fearless advice. In the past it has often been said that public servants need to be in a situation where they feel they can say what needs to be said&mdash;however unpalatable and however unwanted, as it can be on occasions&mdash;to their minister and to their senior officials in order to make sure that good governance is served by that frank, fearless and open advice. There was much debate within the committee and amongst witnesses about whether the changes proposed will interfere  the operation of that frank and fearless advice. On that issue we agreed to disagree, but I think there were real concerns raised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we suspect and I firmly believe will occur under this legislation is that the removal of things like contract periods&mdash;which is what we did when we were in government&mdash;as against lifetime tenure will create a situation where senior officials, who may be at loggerheads with their political masters, could be put in a position where, if they give advice that they think is right and true in the circumstances, they may be signing their death warrant in an employment sense. And that is a real issue. It is an issue which I do not think has been clearly addressed in this bill 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and which the government has dismissed as being not an issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly in some of the evidence we took at the committee, although I agree not all of the evidence, the situation was that a number of people were extremely concerned about how that will work. The problem with such a far-reaching reform is that, for all its good intentions&mdash;although I worry about the motives of some involved in its drafting and operation&mdash;I believe it will have very different conclusions in terms of the operation of the public sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In those circumstances, I think that the foreshadowed opposition amendments ought be supported because they give a basis for maintaining what we see as being the key aspects and strengths of our Public Service: that frank and fearless advice, that corporate memory and that capacity to be able to serve political masters of whatever persuasion on the basis of the decisions of the Australian people. I think there is a danger associated with the approach being taken by the government where we will have a more politicised public service that will, to an extent, be compromised in terms of the directions and the positions that it takes. That will not be good for governance within this country. That is what we have to understand about these bills and about the role of Public Service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are here from year to year, some longer than others and many longer than me. At the end of the day, the operation of government is essentially relying upon the role, the skills and the expertise of the Public Service as it serves all of us. What really worries me about this legislation is that this proposed reform to the Australian Public Service will lead to a situation where that role will be severely compromised. I commend the foreshadowed amendments to the House and I hope that the government will see the sense of the actions proposed.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Some people would think the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R269">Public Service Bill 1997</XREF>  and cognate bills are rather dry and unnecessary. Many people would say that public servants are like lawyers in that the more of them you find at the bottom of the ocean, the more progress you make. But I am 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10213"> not one of the people who holds to that view. I think that public servants in this country are probably more able than most of their private sector counterparts. They are certainly paid less and nowadays, unfortunately, they are also undervalued.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Anyone who has read the remarks in the newspapers today and yesterday on the passing of two great public servants, Nugget Coombs and Fred Gruen, would appreciate that there is a great need in this country for people in the Public Service who see public service as being a very worthwhile role to have in their lives. While this legislation will simplify some of the provisions that govern the employment of people both in the Public Service and in the parliamentary service, it will also ensure that you are less likely to see people of the stature of Nugget Coombs and Fred Gruen. This bill will certainly mean that the role for people who might want to give frank and fearless advice is certainly disappearing from the Public Service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The  Parliamentary Service Bill  will for the first time provide a separate employment framework for people who work in the parliamentary departments and, except where it is considered necessary to distinguish responsibility to the parliament from the Australian Public Service's responsibility to government, the Parliamentary Service Bill is, by and large, a mirror of the Public Service Bill . The differences are meant to reflect the special needs of the houses and of the five departments that service them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the Public Service Bill was first introduced into the parliament, there have been developments which have impacted on the legislation, but the basic thrust and the intent of the legislation remain the same. Two parliamentary committees, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and the Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee, have reported on the public service bills and have mentioned in their reports the Parliamentary Service legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The task for both of these committees was not easy, as my colleague the member for Bruce (Mr Griffin) has just mentioned. He is the Deputy Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee and knows the issues that the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> committee faced. Because of the fluidity of the situation and the timing constraints, those committees were not required to look at the proposed legislation in as much depth as they could have. At the same time, they were looking at it in the knowledge that changes would probably be made as a result of their findings. They did not have the benefit of the knowledge of the detailed regulations or subordinate legislation which would support this bill because those regulations and subordinate legislation were still being drafted and negotiated. Both committees were somewhat unhappy with the legislation in that the goalposts were either shifting or being changed while they were making their report. But they did their respective jobs as best they could and, in the circumstances, we have significantly benefited from their views.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Public Accounts Committee made 20 recommendations for change, and I understand that the government is going to adopt 19 of those. These changes to the bill will also be reflected in the Parliamentary Service Bill, but basically both committees have accepted that the bills are a genuine attempt to give a contemporary legislative basis for employment and management practices in the Australian Public Service and in the Parliamentary Service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To my mind the committees may not have gone as far as they could have in that they do not seem to have seriously questioned the philosophy behind the legislation. They have said that they see these pieces of legislation as making for contemporary legislation, though I think they may have missed the boat a bit in their reports in not looking at some of the underlying things that are involved in this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats did a little bit in the dissenting report to the Senate committee, where they expressed real concerns about what is happening in the Public Service. They said that there was a need to substantially amend the legislation that is before us today. I do not think people should think these are just cosmetic changes to make a bill that is easier to read, a bill that people can say is a 1990s contractual arrangement. There are very significant changes that are being made in the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10214"> ethos of public employment that are reflected in these bills because what the government is doing is creating a captive Public Service, which will certainly be under the thumb of the government. As far as the Parliamentary Service is concerned, one should need to be very careful to see that a similar culture and ethos do not occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation is less complicated and easier to read. This is taken to be a great selling point by the government. It is very commendable to have an easily understood piece of legislation, but it should not be achieved at the cost of an effective and an appropriate Public Service. As I said earlier, I do not think you would see a Nugget Coombs rise in the Public Service if it faced the constraints that are put on it by this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government should be looking not to see enemies within the Public Service, as they are doing now, but to see the Public Service as an instrument that is part of the administration of Australia. The public sector should not work in the same way that a company works, where the loyalty is to the goal of the company and the CEO of the company and in getting the bottom line out for the company. That is not the way the Australian Public Service should work; that is not the way that the administrative organs of government should work. There is a lot to be said for the corporate memory that we have in the Public Service. There is a lot to be said for that great depth of knowledge which is necessary because, while ministers of the time think they are the most important persons in the land, ministers come and go. So there is a need for that continuity which has been provided by the Public Service in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that the drive of the current government is to see that they have a cowed and subdued public sector. I think we saw some of that occur under the government that I was a member of. I do not think that was a good thing then and I do not think it is a good thing now. A small subdued Public Service will be a logical result of the government's policies, and that is not something which is to the benefit of Australia. The government is happy to extol the virtues of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the private sector, but it is not so willing to see any worth in its own public sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The parliament itself will not be insulated from those policies and effects. The Parliamentary Service, which affects all of us who work in this place, is in many ways a microcosm of what remains of the Public Service. We are all experiencing the results of the government's enthusiasm for outsourcing work at any cost here in this building. We have seen arrangements that the government has made with the abolition of the parliamentary travel offices, the use of Comcars and things like that. People out in the public might say that reducing the perks&mdash;as the newspapers would say&mdash;available to members of parliament is a good and terrific thing to do. But when you find that, in the pursuit of the ideology of outsourcing, the government puts a lot of inefficiencies into the way the parliament itself works, then that is a pretty stupid proposition to be working from.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also seen the first of these ideas of slash and burn moving into other parts of the Parliamentary Service. At the beginning of this term, the government decided that they wanted to cut the amount of money available to the parliamentary departments and the expenditure of the parliamentary departments, and we saw an attack on the committee system. Governments in this country have been trying to attack the parliamentary committee system for a long while because they know that the parliamentary committee system is one way that ministers can get put under a bit more scrutiny than the standing orders allow people to do here at question time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen in the House of Representatives, for instance, that the number of staff available to committees has been reduced. We have also seen, most importantly, the level of that staff reduced. The reality of that is that committees now do not have either the intellectual capacity or the time capacity to do the types of reports that they did before. I think that is a very bad thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We in this House strove for a long time to build up the House of Representatives committee system to be an organisation that would look at, and report fearlessly on, things that the government was doing. We have seen 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10215"> in one series of cuts at the beginning of this term years and years of that effort cut back. Government members might say, `That's good. That gets rid of a lot of dead wood. It gets rid of this and it gets rid of that.' But a government that is running unchecked is in the end a government which will cause the government members to lose their seats.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People on both sides of this House should realise that, unless there are constraints upon governments, unless there are checks and balances and unless there is an ability to scrutinise the activities of government, governments will become reckless, and reckless governments are probably the greatest threat there is to government members themselves. The Australian people have shown that they will not support reckless governments and they will tip their parliamentary minions out if they are part of reckless governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen those cuts made and I do not think they are a good thing. Those cuts are the sorts of things which will arise out of these changes that are being made to the Public Service and to the Parliamentary Service. We have also seen in these changes a concentration of further power in the hands of the Prime Minister and those peak agencies in the Public Service itself. Ministers, the Prime Minister and the Public Service Commission will have a stranglehold on the way the service works. The Public Service Commissioner is hardly an independent arbiter now, given the nature of that person's appointment. The secretary to the Prime Minister's department will have a far bigger say, specifically in the choosing of secretaries to agencies, than he had before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, more importantly, we are seeing this attempt to turn the Public Service into a reflection of what is out there in private enterprise. Agency heads will have a far greater power over their employees and the APS will become less of a career service&mdash;people were trained to be broad ranging generalists who could move from one department to another&mdash;and more of a service where people will concentrate on climbing the ladder within their own particular agency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think this will make for a more insular Public Service and it will make for a Public 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Service which will have people dancing to the drum of the agency's secretary. We have seen recently other things occur, such as performance pay, that allow coercive influence of the department heads and this piece of legislation adds to that. I do not think that is a good thing for the Public Service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These wide&hyphen;ranging changes also will get reflected in the parliamentary departments in that we have seen changes, for instance, to the tenure of people in the parliamentary departments. I have always held the view that there should not be much difference in the conditions and the responsibilities of people in the parliamentary departments compared to the Public Service. If we continue to say that what happens here is different, then we will get special deals and nepotism arising in the small departments that you have here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things this legislation does is to once again make special cases. When I was the head of some of the parliamentary departments, I could never see any reason for the heads of some of those departments to have different conditions to the heads of other agencies. In this legislation we are making some rather peculiar exceptions in that, in the attempt of the government and the parliament to hammer out some compromise with the Clerk of the Senate, we have now got a provision in this legislation which provides that the clerks of the parliamentary departments&mdash;not the heads of all the parliamentary departments, just the two clerks; and I do not know why we are continuing to say that some people who head up the parliamentary departments are more worthy than others&mdash;will be appointed for a 10-year non-renewable contract.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that is an absurd proposition. It is the sort of absurd proposition that we see developed because people looked for a compromise in a silly piece of legislation. There should not have been a compromise. The position should have been that we swept away the past and that the heads of the parliamentary departments, be they the clerks or the secretaries to the other three departments, are on the same tenure as each other and that tenure should not be any different from the heads of Public Service agencies. Instead, in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10216"> an attempt to satisfy the Clerk of the Senate, people have slushed around and found what happens to the Auditor&hyphen;General, so they have said, `We'll give the clerk a 10&hyphen;year non&hyphen;renewable term.' It would be awful if we then found someone in the parliamentary departments who was pretty clever and in their 30s. What would we do with these people after that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It strikes me that, if the people who are running the parliamentary departments are good at their job, to have a five&hyphen;year renewable contract would be sensible, because if they are good at their job they would get reappointed and if they are not good at their job they would not get reappointed. In the original draft of this bill&mdash;I am not sure whether it was changed; we were trying to check up on this this morning&mdash;there were provisions for removal but incompetence was not one of those provisions. So you can have a 10&hyphen;year contract, be incompetent and still keep your job, but if you are terribly competent and in your 30s or 40s you can have the job for 10 years and then you will go somewhere.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Obviously I have an interest in the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R360">Parliamentary Service Bill 1997</XREF>  stemming not only from my role as a member of the federal parliament for nearly 13 years&mdash;the anniversary falls on 1 December of this year&mdash;but also, like the previous speaker, the member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay), from having occupied the position of Speaker in the House of Representatives between 1993 and 1996. That role gave me, as it gave my friend the member for Watson, a unique opportunity to see the way in which this building operates, the way in which departments which are part of the Commonwealth Parliament of Australia operate and interact with each other and a unique chance&mdash;at least we believe so&mdash;to contribute. It is therefore with some interest that I read not only the second reading speech but also the legislation which was introduced into this place by the Speaker and is before us today for debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of issues which I would like to touch upon briefly. The first is the fact that, irrespective of what system in a bureaucratic sense is put in place, there is a unique contribution made by the people who work within the Commonwealth Parliament of Australia for the greater good of this institution, stemming from the clerk through to the people who&mdash;perhaps by virtue of comparison, using height&mdash;work in the basement. All of them in this place contribute mightily to the functioning of the parliament. They do so because of a sense of pride in what they do and also because of a sense of commitment which people working in this parliament enjoy. That is why, to some extent, it is important to disaggregate some of the roles ascribed to people by this legislation and the manner in which people are to be appointed to different roles, particularly at the top, and the way in which that opportunity for presid 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="10217"> ing officers to play a legitimate role in this building will not be diminished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much has been said about the issue of appointments of clerks and secretaries within the structure of the parliamentary departments. I can well remember sitting down in somewhat animated discussion&mdash;and, for those who know the former clerk, to be animated it must have been an interesting issue to become involved with&mdash;on the way in which the clerks of the parliament, both in the House of Representatives and in the Senate, were seen in the public sector sense to be inferior to Public Service heads of department. That was reflected not only in a monetary sense but also in the roles which they perceived to play and the manner in which they administered this building. As I have said, there is a uniqueness about the parliament, and the way in which it is administered requires people to step back a touch from what is considered to be the regular Public Service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In those discussions with Lyn Barlin&mdash;and these were statistics that could never be disputed&mdash;we talked about the fact that Lyn, and now the present clerk, Ian Harris, controls the destinies of people in the Department of the House of Representatives. In many cases, they are many times greater destinies than some of the other government departments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of those departments have now disappeared; nevertheless they were still out there, and other parts of the bureaucracy are still out there now. Their total numbers vary from 40 to 60 personnel in some areas, up to 120 personnel in others&mdash;they are just figures off the top of my head&mdash;but in the House of Representatives, just as there is in the Senate, there is a sizeable work force for which the clerks have responsibility, yet for some reason there was this non-recognition that they were actually heads of departments in the pure Public Service sense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lyn and I&mdash;and Ian Harris too&mdash;used to become involved in some discussions about how we might change that perception. There were contributions and submissions made to remuneration tribunals and other organisations to try to get that recognition factor changed. From time to time we were marginally successful, but at the end of the day there was 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> still some resistance from Public Service mandarins who thought, `No, those people up on the hill&mdash;that's the Parliament of Australia. It's not really Public Service, is it?' I beg to differ. I would tend to think that this is the purest form of public service and that the people who work within this building deliver that purest form of public service. Nevertheless, it is appropriate that this legislation is before us today which sets out some of those very real and very necessary changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am mindful of what the member for Watson said in his comments about the broader Public Service concept and so on. We do not want to diminish that role and make it unattractive for people wishing to enter the Public Service so that they think there is not a career path structure for them. I would certainly support his words of caution in that respect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In regard to some of the appointments that are contained within this legislation&mdash;I am referring specifically to the Clerks of the House of Representatives and the Senate and also to secretaries, other than clerks, to parliamentary departments&mdash;there is a difference of approach yet again. For example, the legislation proposes that the clerks in both places be appointed for a non&hyphen;renewable period of 10 years but that secretaries be appointed for five&hyphen;year terms with termination arrangements similar to those applying to secretaries to executive departments and with the possibility of reappointment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When this legislation came before us for consideration, I said within our party room and within the shadow ministry that, if we were going to go the whole hog, maybe that anomalous situation that is still here needed to be redressed if we were to get an absolute recognition of the role that the clerks play, of the very significant stature that that position has and of the very real administrative role that that position has&mdash;just as it does whether you happen to be the Secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Secretary to the Department of Defence or the secretary to any other department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, as you well know, because you take a great interest in these matters, there is a financial implication 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10218"> in all of this. The public administration of moneys on behalf of the taxpayers of Australia is probably more under scrutiny in this building than anywhere else. The member for Watson referred to some of that scrutiny recently in respect of travel arrangements. There is no doubt that that is the case. There is no doubt that that scrutiny requirement on members of parliament is much tougher. People like the Clerk of the House of Representatives, the Clerk of the Senate and the secretaries to the other parliamentary departments provide guidance to members of parliament to carry out their duties as members of parliament. So they have administrative and accountability responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of the day we came down on the side of supporting this legislation, but again I do not raise it simply because I am concerned about either clerk being singled out. I think the present government was endeavouring to do that with the Clerk of the Senate and to suggest that perhaps a shorter tenure was necessary. I am simply raising it because I believe we need to equate the clerks' positions in this parliament with the highest levels of the Public Service, with the mandarins in the Public Service, because the work that they do is well and truly equated in that respect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a couple of other issues that I want to touch upon as well in respect of this legislation. The first goes to the concept of a code of conduct. This bill contains a statement of parliamentary service values and a code of conduct, which I think is quite reasonable and quite rare. It is interesting that these Public Service values that are contained in the legislation and the Parliamentary Service code of conduct go through issues associated with what employees in this organisation should contribute and the sorts of values that they should uphold.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am mindful that in the course of the last parliament the then President of the Senate, former Senator Beahan, and I were involved in an exercise in trying to develop a similar set of values or a code of conduct for members and senators and also for ministers. I can well recall at the time that, when we sat down to try to devise that concept of what ministers, members and senators should hold 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> as core values, it became a very interesting task. It was a difficult task because people did not want to define values as tightly as would require codification of penalties and those sorts of issues, but at the same time it tried to set core values for members of parliament and the conservation of the use of resources that they are given.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of the day it is the taxpayers who provide the wherewithal for us to do our jobs as members and senators. It is the taxpayers, through the appropriations system of the budget, that allow us as members and senators to write to our constituents, to get telephone calls from them, to travel to see them, to embark upon policy determinations and to look at ways in which we as members of parliament might work up those platforms and policies that we want to put in place. We should be ever mindful that there is that real responsibility on us to do that in a sense which is both responsible and accountable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have maintained all along that about 95 per cent to 98 per cent of all members and senators probably do that. There may be one or two who have brought us all into disrepute by not doing that. In time, people will be judged according to what is mentioned in the media, in particular, about those sorts of individuals. They will also be judged by their peers. But it is important that the Parliamentary Service code of conduct and values outlined here are things that members of parliament also from time to time reflect on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other issue is the directions given by Presiding Officers and secretaries to staff under their direct control. Obviously, if you are the boss in a management sense and you give directions, you expect those directions to be carried out. Those directions are often put in place after extensive consultation. I know that the clerks and the secretaries of the other departments here on Capital Hill do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, I think the role and responsibility of defining this as something that can continue happen is justifiable in the circumstances and is very appropriate in ensuring that people who work within this building are given clear directions and that policy statements are put out to give them some guidance in that respect but that at the same time the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10219"> clerks and the secretaries can give those directions when necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Based on the complaints about the catering arrangements that I have been getting from people around this place, it would be good if some of those directions could be exercised now. It is a sad fact that some of my staff and other staff on the Labor Party side&mdash;and I do not think it is just on the Labor Party side&mdash;have complained of becoming ill as a result of some of the catering arrangements in this building&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mr Truss interjecting</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8I4">Mr MARTIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wonder if this is a plot that has been hatched within the government ranks to do something about the already depleted opposition! In a very serious sense, I hope that those that administer this building take on board those sorts of concerns. That is a legitimate concern and a legitimate role for secretaries and clerks of this building to look at&mdash;and, might I say, for the Presiding Officers, because, as you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, at the end of the day it is the two Presiding Officers that have ultimate responsibility for the running of this building and the parliamentary departments which are within the building. Those sorts of issues need to be addressed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To conclude, the legislation, which goes to the very heart of how parliamentary services in this building are delivered to members and senators and the occupants of the building, is a very important piece of legislation. It is one which will need to be reviewed from time to time. It will need to be kept under constant review by the Presiding Officers. I know that they will do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure that, if anomalies subsequently emerge as a result of this, we may see a need to  come  back  and  implement  some  other  
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> changes. From our side&mdash;and personally, as someone who has taken a great deal of interest in the running of this place&mdash;I would like to think that we will see a smoother, better operating set of parliamentary departments here on Capital Hill and that, under the guidance of both Mr Speaker and Madam President, those arrangements will see a very smooth functioning section of the Public Service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That should be recognised more widely within the broader Public Service because, as I said at the beginning, at the end of the day it is departments like the Department of the House of Representatives and the Department of the Senate which give the wherewithal for other departments to operate, because we pass the laws.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10221"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The purpose of <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R169">Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1997</XREF>  is to amend the Excise Tariff Act 1921 to ensure the continuing excisability of all beverages which contain distilled alcohol, including spirits, regardless of their alcohol content.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In November 1994, Carlton and United Breweries commenced the manufacture of the product known as sub zero alcoholic soda, which had an alcoholic content of approximately 5.5 per cent. The Australian Customs Service considered sub zero excisable under subitem 2H of the schedule to the tariff act as  a spirituous beverage. CUB appealed the decision of the ACS to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 7 June 1996, the AAT determined that the production of sub zero with such a low alcohol content by volume could not be described as spirituous and therefore was not excisable under subitem 2H. The decision was based on what the AAT considered is commonly regarded as the definition of spirit in the community, which is a strong alcoholic liquor, usually containing not less than 37 per cent alcohol by volume. The matter is still subject to appeal to the full Federal Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill in its original form sought to amend the Excise Tariff Act 1921, in effect to maintain the status quo with the legislation. The Senate amendments seek to impose the beer rate of excise on any product in the National Food Authority standard P5. The effects of these amendments will be twofold on alcoholic beverages in the P5 category with an alcoholic content of less than five per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rate of excise on spirit based pre&hyphen;mixed drinks in the P5 category will fall from $36.99 per litre of alcohol to $15.89 per litre of alcohol and, for the first time, excise will be imposed on other alcoholic products in the P5 category not currently subject to excise. It is apparently the intention of the Senate amendments to reduce the disparity in the taxation of alcoholic products by reducing the excise payable on highly taxed spirit based products and imposing, for the first time, excise on currently excise free beverages. The government remains of the view that the bill 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> as originally introduced should not be amended.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday in the Main Committee in the debate on <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R169">Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1997</XREF>  I told the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs (Mr Truss) that we would welcome the opportunity to have discussions with and get the point of view of the customs minister&mdash;I was referring to the three customs ministers, including himself, who have occupied that position in the last seven months since I have been the shadow minister&mdash;on issues arising from that portfolio responsibility. Regrettably, Minister, this is one of those times when I have to say that we are bitterly disappointed about what has happened. It is not through any fault of your own; rather it is the fault of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) for failing to provide costings on the effect that this particular amendment is likely to have. Clearly this is an issue which will guide the way in which the opposition will deal with this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should say at the outset that the opposition will not support the government on this issue at this stage. I point out to the minister that for a number of reasons we support the amendment that was moved in the Senate. Many of these reasons are outlined in the dissenting report by Senator Jacinta Collins and go to issues which I will elaborate on in a minute. The simple facts are this: the government has delayed debate on this bill for almost three months, and like us, I am sure, has been lobbied heavily by various interest groups about this particular Senate amendment. As I understand it, some of those lobbyists are disappointed because they have not been able to get to see relevant ministers to put a point of view to them. In this lobbying exercise, information about the claims of potential revenue loss and the impact that this might have on the government's bottom line has not been forthcoming. Certainly we have not been provided by the government with any costings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have tried to get those costings&mdash;we wanted to get some sort of detailing of the financial impact of the Senate amendment&mdash;but nothing has come forward. We under 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="10222"> stand, having been in government for a period of time, that when there is a delay in something like this it is generally because a department, probably Treasury, has its hands all over it and is playing delaying tactics because they have not done the costings which normally would be required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We would like to get a detailed costing from Treasury to clarify the exact revenue implications, assuming the changes in prices will lead changes in the volume of sales. There is an assumption in a lot of the information we have been given that those sales volumes will be exactly the same. Some of  the lobbyists are arguing, `No, that will not be the case. If you equate spirituous beverages along with beer, you're going to find that there will be a switching between the products.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has to be taken into consideration in this debate is the preference of consumers. People are eligible to go into pubs only when they are 18. Amongst 18&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds up to, say, 24&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds these days there is a preference for spirit based drinks. They like mixed drinks; they like Jim Beam and all the rest of it in preference to beer. This is one of the issues that the major beer producers are concerned about. They are worried that, if an additional price advantage is given, their production, their sales and, therefore, their profitability will be affected. That is a legitimate concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not convinced&mdash;nor could we be convinced&mdash;of the merits of the arguments in this particular matter because we have not been provided with the costings that Treasury should have done for the government. Accordingly, we believe it is only fair that we reserve our right to deliberate further on the issue of changing the taxation levels on alcoholic beverages pending costings from Treasury.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a couple of other issues that I want to raise in this respect. Firstly, keeping in mind the absence of Treasury costings, the opposition recognises that the Senate amendments that have been moved strongly adhere to the government's own taxation philosophy of cutting off emerging loopholes, broadening 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the base and lowering the rate, making taxation appear to be fairer and more equitable for all Australians. So, if you were a consumer, you would probably think you were getting a reasonable deal. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> As a consequence, an argument could be sustained that making it fairer and equitable for all Australians will achieve an underlying government objective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But in that argument we need to see one or two hooks. Currently, ready to drink alcoholic beverages are taxed at the same rate as spirits regardless of the alcoholic content of the drink in question. Whether the beverage is four per cent alcohol or 25 per cent alcohol, it is taxed at the same rate. Spirits are currently taxed at approximately twice the rate as is beer. We see this as fundamentally unfair. The Senate amendments to the bill will allow the tax on ready to drink alcoholic beverages to be the same as on beer, providing the alcoholic content is less than five per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that a number of beer manufacturers will argue that in that case people would simply start a manufacturing process to get under that five per cent level and attract a cheaper tax rate and a cheaper excise rate as well. They will argue that this is a way of getting around that particular issue. Again, this is a problem that Treasury needs to look at and discuss with your department to see whether we can come up with a situation which will alleviate those sorts of concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, as ready to drink beverages compete in the same market as beer, making the taxation levels equal will be a lot fairer for them, according to some in the industry at least. Competitive pricing regimes for the same class of alcoholic beverage will also give Australian consumers more choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A favourable taxation regime for less alcohol in ready to drink beverages will inevitably lead to a general lowering of the level of alcohol in those beverages. This could very well have positive social outcomes in view of the number of times domestic violence is related to alcohol&mdash;and a very famous case involving a footballer in this town recently indicates that. So the lowering of the alcohol level could have very positive social outcomes.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10223">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lowering the amount of alcohol in beverages will lead to less alcohol in people's bodies and have a positive effect on the long&hyphen;term health of Australians. Encouraging the alcoholic beverage industry to lower alcohol levels can only be a step in the right direction. We recognise that that is the fact. We recognise that that really is an issue that needs to be addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition believes it is the federal government's responsibility to structure the taxation regime to encourage the alcoholic beverage industry to lower the level of alcohol present in the drinks on the market. Accordingly, we believe that the Senate  amendment which is aimed at doing that is a step in the right direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I go back to where I started and indicate that, in the absence of a view about the way in which the taxation regime as proposed here in this legislation and knocking off the Senate amendment will impact on the industry from a costings point of view, we reserve our right in respect of this total matter. At this stage the opposition is predisposed towards supporting the amendment that was moved in the Senate. But we believe that both the minister at the table, the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs, and also the Treasurer need to address that absolute issue about the implications for the industry in a revenue sense, the implications for the government in a revenue sense and the costs associated with this proposal because, as I said, there is an absolute absence of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of the day the simple fact is that something that has been hidden away for three months and is suddenly brought back now is of concern. The lobbyists from both sides&mdash;those that are in the spirits industry and those that are in the beer industry that have been going around and trying to talk to people on both sides of the parliament&mdash;are a touch confused about this. They are a bit annoyed as well that this has been brought on now when they are still trying to see ministers to put a point of view and it is here before the parliament today. I am sure they will take that up individually with the government.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not up to the opposition to get them out of a problem that they have with this government. It is not up to us to save their bacon. It is up to them to take their fight direct to this government to argue a case with them. I can recall one of these lobbyists&mdash;whose name will remain confidential&mdash;came to see me and I said, `Have you spoken to the government and the government ministers?' They said, `Oh, no. Should we?' I said, `Well, they're the government. We're the opposition. But by all means go and talk to the government ministers and put a point of view to them. It is their legislation that they are introducing. So go and have a chat to them.' I hope they have taken that seriously on board. I indicate again that we are predisposed to support the amendments. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not respond at any length to the comments by the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Martin). I can assure him that even though I have been minister for only a very short time the various lobbying interests have already found their way to my door. I have had the privilege of meeting people from all sides of this argument. I have listened to the social and the economic arguments, and the government has decided to proceed with its original proposal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very difficult to cost, as I am sure the honourable member for Cunningham would acknowledge&mdash;he referred to it in fact in his remarks&mdash;the revenue implications with any degree of reliability in relation to these proposals, because it would require some degree of assessment as to how much substitution is going to occur, how much there is alteration of formulae and how many products might have their alcohol level adjusted slightly to take account of whatever excise regime is put in place for the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So even with the best will in the world it will not be possible to deliver accurate costing estimates.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Howard coalition government is petty, mean and vindictive. In almost all of its actions and in almost every piece of legislation before this House, this Howard coalition government is callous, mean-spirited and thoroughly ideological. This government shelters behind its electoral mandate, the product of conning the electorate about its real intentions, and the electorates inadvertence as to the coalition's real nature and intent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government continues to assert its mandate and behaves like a schoolyard bully seeking craven submission from anyone who criticises it or its policies. We will not cop that on this side of the House. We will criticise and condemn an inept, bullying, brutalising government, and it deserves to cop it in spades, and nowhere more so than with this legislation, which attacks the core of the Public Service&mdash;and that is its ability to provide independent, objective advice to the government rather than the partisan, lickspittle, sycophantic advice that this coalition thinks is appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just yesterday, we heard of the passing of one of the great public servants that this land has produced, Nugget Coombs. Nugget Coombs knew a lot about serving the public, the parliament and the government and he 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10225"> knew that if you were not innovative, inventive and thoughtful and if you were not willing to push forward fresh advice, based on sound reason, you would not be doing your job and you should not be in the game.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did a man who served seven prime ministers strike during the Menzies years? What was the attitude of the Menzies government to economic affairs? It was a bit different to the Howard attitude. Nugget Coombs recalled later how Sir Robert Menzies once told him:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I'm not interested in economics. I get bored listening to people talking about it but there are times when, as Prime Minister, I should know about it. If you feel the economic situation is of a kind I should know about, ring me up and I'll come and talk about it.</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Menzies years of idling ad&hyphen;hocracy in economic and other affairs were not to be that of the Fraser period which, in fact, again was a period of idling ad&hyphen;hocracy, according to the current Prime Minister (Mr Howard), who had great difficulty because he saw those years as the lost years for the Liberals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This Prime Minister, the member for Bennelong, knows&mdash;in fact has said quite recently in May of 1996&mdash;that the Public Service should provide frank, independent, fearless and honest advice. Treasurers or prime ministers do not necessarily have to take that advice. We note that when the Public Service advised him, the then Treasurer, in 1983 that he should cough up and admit that the budget deficit was in the order of $9.6 billion he favoured his own guess rather than the figures coming out of Treasury. He guessed that $4.6 billion was a pretty good number to put up to people and, right at the end of the campaign, a couple of days before the election in March 1983, he finally said that it might be about $6 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This Prime Minister does not believe that you actually have to take the advice of public servants, but he has been under pressure in the past as Treasurer when they have provided him with very direct advice that he should be truthful and open with the public and the parliament. That put him under a great deal of pressure.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of key areas that we in the Labor Party feel are most disturbing about this set of legislation. Firstly, this legislation will, by its very nature, erode the independence of the Public Service. It will no longer be the Public Service; it will become the government service operating at the government of the day's whim and behest. It will inexorably become a politically partisan service. Secondly, there will be no public scrutiny of appointments, wages and conditions of agency heads and these will in turn not be subject to public scrutiny but a mere casual glance and gaze of government ministers. We know how deficient that can be based on the experience of the past 19 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, those agency heads will be able to hire, fire and determine pay and conditions for employees. At the same time, the staff of those agencies will also lose their unfair dismissal rights under the Workplace Relations Act. Fourthly, there will be competition, differentiation and rivalry between departments and agencies, with a corresponding increase in and duplication of the administration of these departments. This will mean that the Public Service will no longer be a broadly integrated career service, with the consequential loss of all the institutional memory that goes with that, but a separated, fragmented and disjointed cabal of competing interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fifthly, the Merit Protection (Australian Government Employees) Act is being repealed. This is to be replaced with in&hyphen;house procedures in each agency. This will, more than likely, lead to more litigation because employees will have no method for internal review of decisions about their employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last and most important point for this House to note is that this bill will fundamentally weaken the parliament in a number of ways. The most important of these is that this bill will dramatically reduce the ability of the parliament to scrutinise the executive and the Public Service that supports that executive. These sentiments in fact were shared by Harry Evans, the Clerk of the Senate, in his evidence to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. Report No. 353 states:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10226">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These sentiments were shared by Harry Evans, the Clerk of the Senate, who submitted that the Bill proposed a `new model' of public service and that if enacted the Bill will establish a service which `belongs body and soul, to the ministers of the day'.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The report goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This, he argued, could have significant consequences for the relationship between the APS and the Parliament and for the capacity of the Parliament to scrutinise the Executive. Currently the public service is still a valuable source of independent advice to the Parliament, with many public servants recognising that they have a duty to assist the Parliament by cooperating with parliamentary inquiries and by answering frankly and freely questions put to them in the course of parliamentary inquiries. Mr Evans contends that the employment regime proposed in the Bill will make it difficult for public servants to fulfil this responsibility and that Members of Parliament are increasingly likely to be confronted with ministers and their (dismissible) employees `all singing the same well&hyphen;orchestrated song'.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is no wonder they want to give him the flick because this is frank and fearless advice, and it is not welcome advice either for Dr Kemp, the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, nor the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, Mr Reith, who in fact initiated this process in November 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition does not dispute the need for simplification of the 1922 act. What it does object to is the bastardisation of the Public Service by a delusional government. A public service is exactly that&mdash;a public service. The APS is there to provide the government with independent advice that is in the national interest. This coalition government thinks that the APS should be but a mere plaything of the government of the day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This partisan government of the moment has accused the previous Labor government of politicising the Australian Public Service. It is ludicrous to be accused of politicising the Public Service because Labor had the temerity to take advice from the Public Service, which had the experience and understanding of the functions of federal government and its services. We sought sensible, balanced, authoritative and knowledgeable advice from the specialists in the Public Service. We did not 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ask for bootlickers or yes&hyphen;men to tell us what we wanted to hear. We asked for prudent, thoughtful and rounded advice that reflected the needs of the nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Public Service is not there to serve private interests, or party interests, or business interests, or special interests, or sectional interests. The Public Service is there to serve the public and the national interest. It is this coalition government that is trying to politicise the Public Service and turn it into yet another faction of the Liberal Party. Why else would they want to remove the ability of the parliament and the public to scrutinise a range of Public Service employment issues?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Joint Parliamentary Committee of Public Accounts in its report No. 353 on this piece of legislation received a large number of submissions. It was the dramatic proposed changes to Public Service employment conditions that raised the most concern. The JCPA also reviewed this legislation in their report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Towards a best practice public service</EMPHASIS>. The government always has a majority on committees, and so the committee was loaded up to give a green light to this legislation and congratulate the coalition government for a job well done. But coalition members could not ignore the evidence placed before it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee held a round table discussion on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Towards a best practice public service</EMPHASIS> earlier this year. In that discussion, they had 18 very well qualified people from a broad range of groups discuss changes to the Public Service. It is interesting to read some of the comments made in relation to this legislation. Mr Jack Waterford, the Editor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>, made these comments:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have spent the better part of two decades making what have been, by and large, very good reforms to financial administration, to the mechanisms of accountability&mdash;half of which we now seem to want to throw out the window&mdash;and to reorganising functions and so on. Those have generally been good changes. But we have neglected the prudent management of the greatest single asset the Commonwealth has&mdash;the brains, the talents, the idealism and enthusiasm of its work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have to say that the neglect is often most pronounced amongst many of the apostles of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10227"> other reforms, who add to their own lack of skills in managing people an often voiced and very dispiriting disparagement of the very idea of public service and the notion that being a public servant is somehow mediocre and second rate.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Waterford also commented on one of the key concerns that has been raised by this legislation, the possibility that the Public Service could become a place where nepotism is widespread. I again quote him:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the essential requirement of the old system was that positions had to be advertised, and that the best of those who applied should be chosen. I do not think there is anything wrong with that. I do think there is a very significant risk that a system in which senior managers are free to pick people without advertisement creates a real risk of creating organisations full of clones and crones of the prevailing management&mdash;perhaps not appointed nepotistically, or with direct patronage, but picked from the core of people who the boss already knows, whom he or she regards as thinking rather like himself or herself.</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Luckily, we have those processes where brave and fearless advice, even from outside the Public Service, can in fact be given to parliamentary committees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Government ministers in fact travel the world paying lip&hyphen;service to transparency in government and independent advice. They even criticise other governments in ministerial briefing papers for not getting transparent and impartial advice. Yet, with one piece of legislation out of the four in this cognate debate, they will be showing just how hollow and hypocritical those words are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This coalition government is trying to destroy the independence of the Public Service and the transparency of government with two pieces of legislation. The first is the main one I have been discussing here today, the public employment bill, and the second in the cognate debate is the Public Service Bill 1997. We cannot separate these pieces of legislation when it comes to the debate in this House. These two pieces of legislation are a two&hyphen;pronged attack on the Public Service. Therefore, we are dealing with them in this cognate debate. They are of a piece&mdash;interlocking sets in the jigsaw put together by a government that is cognitively challenged. This is dumb stuff, Mr Deputy Speaker&mdash;really dumb stuff.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The JCPA inquiry looked into both of these pieces of legislation together, and they could not ignore the many voices that expressed concerns raised by the legislation's removal of the transparency of the executive and those that advise them. I quote from page 23 of the report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee considers that downgrading the status of annual report requirements for Commonwealth departments is a retrograde step. . . Annual reports are key accountability documents. It is through annual reports to Parliament that agencies account for their past year's financial results and program performance. . . It is not adequate that the annual report guidelines be prepared at the discretion of executive agencies after consultation with the Parliament. . . A desire to achieve a streamlined Act is not sufficient reason to change the current arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The committee's comments are dead accurate. This is a government that talks about transparency but trades in opaqueness and obfuscation. This is a government that wants to bury internal criticism and advice and one that wants to inter departmental conduct, accountability and program performance in a very deep and inaccessible funeral vault.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian National Audit Office, Harry Evans, the Clerk of the Senate, and others told the JCPA that there was a need for the independent setting of conditions and remuneration of the senior Public Service, and the committee agreed. Mr Max Moore-Wilton did not. But then members of this coalition government and their senior staff, with their born to rule mentality, do not believe that the parliament and the public have a right to question their remuneration or decisions. The report recommended in recommendation 17:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The aggregate remuneration of agency heads and the Public Service Commissioner should continue to be open to public scrutiny and published in the annual financial statements of Commonwealth agencies.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I am glad to see that yesterday the minister, in dealing with these matters, indicated that most of the recommendations of report No. 353 would be taken up. I will be exceedingly interested to see just how those recommendations are taken up and how fully they are 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10228"> implemented because they provide some balance to these pieces of legislation, which are so utterly imbalanced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government, armed with its big canary&hyphen;yellow ideological compendium&mdash;the Maoists had the little red book; this is a bit bigger, a big yellow book&mdash;waved frantically and enthusiastically by the throng over the other side, except for those who have not read it, do not want anyone to offer considered independent advice. They accused the Public Service for years of being a hothouse of socialists who were anti-Liberal. That would be news for Sir Lenox Hewitt, who was the head of the Australian Public Service and served under a few coalition governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sir Lenox was one of the most strident critics of this legislation. He told the inquiry that the removal of the `sine qua non of a career' was a threat to independent advice. The strength of the Public Service for Sir  Lenox was its independence, and I quote his strong evidence:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the intention to change, indeed to destroy, the Australian Public Service and to convert it into a series of appointments at pleasure&mdash;at the whim, in the case of secretaries of the Prime Minister; in the case of agency heads, of  the minister . . . That to me is a fundamental change in the service that was established . . . what we are dealing with here, too, is not the dismissal; it is the threat hanging over. You will destroy frank, fearless, honest advice if you are party to this proposal of the executive.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">No more accurate or damning advice could have been proffered by the former head of the Australian Public Service. This legislation imperils the very existence of the Australian Public Service as Sir Lenox and we have known it. This parliament should not be a party to the gutting of an institution dedicated to a noble ideal&mdash;serving the public rather than mere political masters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why is it that every time we have a controversial piece of legislation before this House that deals with government service we have to go back and have a look at the big yellow book, the National Commission of Audit? Since June 1996, it seems that government policy has been predetermined by this trite ideological document. In fact, this coalition government absolutely predetermined what 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the NCA would recommend. That is why it is so trite and so utterly ideological. Whether it is transport, infrastructure, the aged or industrial relations, this document and its contents are put forward as the coalition's panacea for the nation's ills. However, I am afraid that the cure might be more painful and more deadly than the disease.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here are some of the key recommendations in regard to this legislation at hand: remuneration, inefficiency, termination procedures, more flexible employment arrangements, and so on. It is no surprise that the key recommendations that the NCA puts up are the key points in this legislation. Why bother having a government or ministers to do the job if you are going to gut the Public Service? <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the very thoughtful and well&hyphen;informed remarks of the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Hatton) and to make a few, not too extensive, observations of my own concerning the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R269">Public Service Bill 1997</XREF> and its impact on public service. At the risk of sounding like a dinosaur, I am someone who joined the Public Service after I left university, someone who is attracted to traditional models of public service, and someone who is uncomfortable with some of the changes that we have seen and are seeing in our Public Service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is regrettable, I think, that from the other side of politics that you find the concept of public service and the idea of public servants being treated as objects of abuse. Indeed the term `public servant' is used from the government benches occasionally as a term of abuse. Just a few days ago the member for Eden&hyphen;Monaro (Mr Nairn) came into the House during the adjournment debate and said, `Look at all the opposition frontbenchers or shadow ministers,' and he ran through their previous occupations. He was very keen to note that a number of opposition frontbenchers have trade union backgrounds, but he noted that the others were public servants. Cries of derision came from the government benches that people should have been public servants before entering the parliament.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10229">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It strikes me as ironic that members of the government should regard `public servant' as a term of abuse or use `public service' in a derogatory way because, in a sense, why are they here if they think the Public Service is inappropriate? It is indeed a large part of what we endeavour to do as members of parliament&mdash;serve the public. I know it is fashionable to criticise politicians and public servants but, nevertheless, it seems to me that at the bottom of it all we do very important work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can remember an address by Ralph Nader some 20 years or so ago saying that the best kind of life is a life lived in public service. That always seemed to me to be pretty accurate. When I was leaving university and thinking about what I could do with my life, the idea of being able to serve the public through a variety of ways in the Commonwealth Public Service was a very good way to go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it should continue to be the case that when young people leave school or university  they should be able to look at public service through the Commonwealth or the states as being a very positive career. It does strike me that a lot of the changes in this bill, and indeed a lot of the other changes that have been made to public service arrangements, have not had that sort of effect, and that is regrettable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that this is not a black and white picture in that everything in the past is good and everything that is coming forward now is bad. Most of us are familiar with <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yes, Minister</EMPHASIS>. It is a very entertaining TV program but it does say a lot of truths about manipulation of public policy by public servants, and I certainly do not advocate or support that in any way, shape or form. It is also the case that, if tenure is absolute and it is impossible to dismiss someone for non&hyphen;performance, you do get into a pattern of long lunches, make&hyphen;work, non-performance and so on. We do not want to see that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the other end of the spectrum, I also want to express the view that job insecurity does not help people, does not help the nation and does not make our lives better. If we want to change the Public Service so that it 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> becomes a place where there is no job security and everybody is on short-term contracts and can be dismissed at the whim of ministers or senior public servants, then that certainly does not improve their lives, does not, in my view, improve the quality of government and does not improve the quality of decision making. As the member for Blaxland pointed out, this does not help the nation to make decisions when we do not get advice from our public servants made without fear and without favour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My background is from Victoria. I saw what happened to the Victorian Public Service after the change of government in 1992. Essentially, Premier Kennett and the incoming Liberal government governed without the Public Service at all. So for a number of months we had all the decisions being made by consultants and the like according to some secret blueprint while public servants sat in their offices not knowing whether they were going to have a job tomorrow and not being given any work to do today. They were not trusted by the incoming government and they were not asked to do anything at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was an alarming model of government. It has continued through the last five years so that there is a fundamental corruption about the Victorian decision making process. I use that word advisedly, because indeed the heads of each department are appointed by the Premier, not by their own ministers, and report directly to the Premier, and he is certainly not above going beyond them and speaking to middle level public servants in the Victorian Public Service. They are not able to give advice without fear or favour; they do as they are told. It is not a model for good government. It is against a background where the Victorian government has also squashed any alternative sources of advice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen in Victoria the Equal Opportunity Commissioner being sacked, freedom of information being limited and, more recently, the Auditor-General having his department taken away from him and his capacity to decide what areas need to be audited or not removed from him. If he wants to talk about the casino, it is, `No, thank you. We don't want you to talk about the casino.' In all 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10230"> those sorts of areas, we have seen the removal of independent sources of authority and power taken from Victoria and all power being centralised in the hands of the Premier. I think that that is not a very satisfactory development at all. I would not want to see us going down this path with the Public Service Bill before the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Blaxland pointed out the report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, which was a very significant report, and raised a number of important concerns about the changes that the government is proposing here. Essentially, that committee was saying that you have to beware of changes which turn the Public Service into government service, changes which destroy the Public Service as a career service, that we ought be concerned about the erosion of quality advice to government and the politicisation of that advice, and that we ought be concerned about the destruction of Public Service cohesion and the loss of Public Service values. I have to say that, in my 18  months or so as a federal MP, it has struck me that the Commonwealth Public Service remains very much more professional than the Victorian Public Service has become. I certainly would not want to see it change in that direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee has been proposing quite a number of amendments to the Public Service Bill to ensure that we have remuneration of secretaries and agency heads fully open to public scrutiny, thereby reducing the chance of secret deals. I think it is most unsatisfactory to have salaries or salary packages kept secret. We also believe Public Service advice ought to be frank, comprehensive and accurate, not simply timely, and that we need to continue to recognise that the Public Service has to be accountable not only to government but also to parliament and the public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the concerns that was highlighted by many of the witnesses who came before that committee was the absence of an independent and binding appeal mechanism for public sector employees. The Public Service Commissioner's credentials as an independent arbiter were rightly questioned by that com 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> mittee. When we look at the evidence before that committee, what it suggested was that there were problems with the abolition of the Merit Protection and Review Agency and the existing appeal rights, that the government ought to maintain independent, binding appeal mechanisms in relation to selection, misconduct, inefficiency and grievances, and that, in the area of career service, the bill does not prescribe any category of employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That creates problems in a career service where permanent employment is the norm. We ought to have temporary or fixed term employment used only in very clearly defined circumstances and there ought to be a clause on categories of employment included in the general employment conditions award. In the area of unfair dismissals, any process leading to termination of employment ought to be open and fair. The idea that there is a potential remedy for unfair dismissal under the Workplace Relations Act is not good enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to have a process leading to termination being properly codified on a service&hyphen;wide basis. We ought not to have the potential for employment conditions to be diminished simply by administrative action. Employment conditions should also not be reduced through changes in the structure of departments and agencies; they ought to be matters of service&hyphen;wide concern and service&hyphen;wide application.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Representations were made for the definition of `merit' to continue to be enshrined in the legislation and not simply left as a matter to be determined from time to time by the Public Service Commissioner. We also had submissions seeking protection for employees against arbitrary transfer. I think that is an important matter, because it is clear that if employees are subject to arbitrary transfer, then that is likely to limit the frank and fearless advice on which good government depends.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Against that background, we see the prospect that these bills could cause the destruction of a cohesive Australian Public Service and could cause a significant loss of corporate memory over time as the notion of a career service is rapidly destroyed. Once again, this is something that has happened in the Victori 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="10231"> an Public Service, where there has been a wholesale loss of corporate memory. Those people who worked for Melbourne Water, for example, are simply no longer there. That has had very adverse effects on good government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is concern that these bills will result in reduced accountability and transparency in Public Service administration; in reduced mobility between federal government agencies, and between those agencies and the parliament; and in reduced emphasis on a whole&hyphen;of&hyphen;government approach that will see increased ministerial involvement in APS employment matters and increased litigation on APS employment matters&mdash;all of those things being most undesirable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we really need is a continuing focus on avenues for review and appeals which contribute to the embodiment of the APS principles of honesty, impartiality and integrity. These things serve as a check on parochial and potentially corrupt decision making. They also serve to ensure that staff are accorded natural justice in decisions which impact upon their employment in the Australian Public Service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Public Service has long had quite substantial appeal mechanisms in relation to promotions, transfers and the like. There is no doubt that, from time to time, those appeal mechanisms were used excessively; but, equally, there is no doubt that, when people were making staff selection and promotion decisions, they were mindful that these appeal and review mechanisms were in place. If you take out those appeal and review mechanisms, then you open up avenues for improper selection decisions to be made and for people to rort staff promotions and the like, knowing that there is no avenue of appeal and that they are not likely to be caught out. We are concerned about changes which would do away with those appeal mechanisms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I would also express some concern about proposals which do away with a central selection process. If we are serious about having open community merit based access to Public Service employment, then you really do need to maintain base level recruitment through a central selection process supplemented by agency specific secondary selec 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tion criteria. Recently, we had a private employment agency quizzing applicants for jobs in the Commonwealth Service Delivery Agency about their views on the Prime Minister's `work for the dole' scheme. We would see that as quite improper to be quizzing applicants about that kind of thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It raises serious concerns about what happens when you devolve or outsource the recruitment practices of the Australian Public Service. Base level recruitment in the APS ought to continue to be coordinated across the APS to ensure maintenance of a cohesive Public Service and to enable government priorities such as reducing youth unemployment to be satisfactorily addressed and to guard against patronage and favouritism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In the area of termination of employment, a single power to terminate employment without reference to any grounds or process is not good enough. We need to have grounds for employment separation included in regulations, awards or  certified agreements. The grounds for employment separation ought to cover issues such as resignation, redundancy, invalidity, inefficiency, disciplinary dismissal, loss of qualifications, abandonment of employment, and so on. Similarly, in the area of retirement, the ability to vary the retirement age through regulation is unacceptable. It is an important public policy issue that ought to be the subject of parliamentary debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The final point I will make reference to concerns the issue of protection for whistleblowers. Clause 16 provides that `a person performing in or for an Agency must not victimise, or discriminate against, an APS employee who has reported breaches of the Code of Conduct' to the commissioner or an agency head, or to their authorised representative. That is a long way short of the coalition's 1996 public administration policy, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In accordance with the recommendation of the Senate Select Committee on Whistleblowing, a Coalition Government will introduce legislation to facilitate disclosures of confidential information in the public interest and to ensure protection for those who choose to do so.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What the government is putting forward in the bill clearly falls a long way short of that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10232"> policy. Labor has proposed that there be a capacity for whistleblowers to make disclosures to the Ombudsman. It is certainly my belief that we need to have appropriate mechanisms to protect whistleblowers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As many people in the House would be aware, all too often it is the whistleblower whose career suffers as a result of their indicating the wrongdoing of others&mdash;whether it be in the Public Service or in the private sector&mdash;rather than the actual wrongdoer. That is entirely inappropriate. If we are serious about making sure that we do not find corruption in the Public Service or elsewhere, then there ought to be proper protection for whistleblowers. While clause 16 represents a new provision, it seems to me that we ought to be looking at going further by way of providing proper protection for whistleblowers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Having outlined those concerns to the House, it is the intention of the opposition to move a number of amendments designed to improve the operation and the workability of  this bill. I would ask honourable members to support those amendments.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R269">Public Service Bill 1997</XREF>  and the accompanying bills that are now being debated before the House are important pieces of legislation because they do set the framework in which the Australian Public Service will develop and operate over the next decade. These bills will influence greatly the culture of that Public Service, its efficiency and its ability to serve governments of whatever political persuasion in a fearless and impartial way and in the national interest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In past years Australia has been blessed with a very professional and impartial Public Service. So when a package of legislation comes before the parliament which seeks to fundamentally change the way in which that Public Service operates then, in the national interest, it should come under the great scrutiny of this chamber and the parliament. At the end of the day, an efficient Public Service means that you have an efficient and competent government. It is really the impar 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tial and fearless advice coming from the Public Service that sets a bottom line for governments as far as their own competence and their own efficiency are concerned. When we view this package of bills before the House, there are some very real concerns that what is being proposed by the government may well have unintended consequences that might compromise that impartiality and efficiency which have been the hallmarks of the Australian Public Service to this point in our history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the last decade the Australian Public Service has gone through a period of rapid transformation, and that transformation took place under the aegis of governments of Labor persuasion. We make no apologies for that because I think the Australian public required governments to examine the operating efficiencies of the public sector and to seek, where they could, to get greater value out of the taxpayers' dollars, both in the programs that were being put before the Australian people and in the administration of those particular programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think those reforms that we introduced when in government were done with a degree of sensitivity and with an eye to maintaining that impartiality and fearless advice that comes from our federal Public Service. Although there were criticisms at the time of attempts to politicise the Public Service&mdash;and that came from the then opposition&mdash;I do not think the cries that came at that particular time are going to be anywhere near the public concern that is going to be expressed about the package of reforms that are now before the Australian parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a national Public Service which is acknowledged to be one of the best in the world. It is a technologically advanced service which employs sophisticated management systems, and it is a very professional service which has won the admiration of not only people in this country but others throughout the world. As Australia mourns the passing of one of its great public servants and great public figures, one is left to wonder and to muse whether, under the structures that are being proposed in this legislation, we will 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10233"> ever see public servants of the stature of Nugget Coombs emerge in Australian public life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before any government contemplates reform of the federal Public Service, it must have some real understanding and appreciation of the special nature of employment in this sector. I do not think it is widely understood in the Australian community that there are different imperatives that exist in public sector employment compared with private sector employment. If the government does not appreciate these factors, it runs a very grave risk in any reform program of compromising and even destroying some very important features of that Public Service. Governments must appreciate that public sector employees operate in a quite different environment to many private sector employees. They are certainly bound by different political constrains and the ethical base on which they must operate is very different also.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What concerns me in this particular set of legislation is the way in which it greatly enhances the power of the Prime Minister over appointments to the top echelons of the  Public Service. I think this is a concern that is being echoed throughout the length and breadth of the Australian community. Under this legislation, the Prime Minister will have the power to appoint departmental secretaries and to decide on their remuneration and conditions of employment. Baldly stated&mdash;and I do not think we ought to walk away from this particular fact&mdash;this will enable a government in power to politicise the Public Service far more than any previous government has had the ability to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it would be a tragedy for this country if governments were to walk down that road. One thing that has always prevented governments from walking down that road is a different set of arrangements which govern the appointment of public sector employees, especially those in the top echelons. We in government made certain changes to the way in which those in the top echelons were appointed, but this particular legislation goes further than anything that we did in office. It concentrates enormous power in the hands of the Prime Minister and the secretary to his 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> department over those particular appointments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At a time when government in Western societies and industrialised societies is extremely complex and at a time when governments need fearless and impartial advice, the people who are going to be giving that advice are going to be beholden to the government and to the Prime Minister to a greater extent than they ever have been in the past. I think that is a regrettable development. The consequence of what is being proposed will be that the Public Service will simply become the captive of the government of the day, and the frank and fearless advice that has flowed to ministers from that Public Service will be severely diminished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not propose to go into great detail on the legislation because that has already been canvassed by previous speakers in this debate, but in my concluding remarks I wish to pay tribute to the public sector employees in my electorate. In recent times they have borne a very heavy burden. That burden has been in the form of the restructuring of their departments, the introduction of new systems and new technologies, and significant downsizing in key regional departments where the workload has actually increased. I refer there to the old Commonwealth Employment Service and the Department of Social Security.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those public servants in my electorate have diligently performed their duties in the face of quite adverse circumstance where they have had to cope with an increasing task with reduced numbers. One might say that this is a process that has occurred elsewhere throughout the Australian economy. I do not deny that, but I want to on the floor of this House today acknowledge the contribution of our public servants in Geelong and the Barwon region to the life of our community and to the delivery of very important services to residents in my electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a general public perception, which has been built up over time, that public servants do not add value to their communities. Certainly in an economic sense their salaries make a very important contribution to the economic activity of my particular region 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10234"> and to many small businesses in my electorate. But more importantly&mdash;and we get away from the pure economic side of having a strong public sector presence in a regional economy&mdash;the services that are provided to residents by a professional Public Service are greatly appreciated by that community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On behalf of the Geelong community I want to put on the public record our thanks to those public sector employees for their contribution to our community. They have in the past been the subject of some ridicule. They have in the past been the subject of unfair criticism. I want to address that criticism in this debate today and say to those public servants that do we appreciate the contribution that you have made to our community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under this legislation, the federal Public Service as we know it will be changed forever. Our concern when governments make these changes is that they do make them for the better and that they clearly understand the ramifications of what they are proposing.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not deny that the public sector must be subject to an ongoing process of reform and I do not deny that there are elements of this legislation where the government has attempted to come to grips with real reform issues, but there are substantial concerns with this legislation in that these bills will change fundamentally the way the Public Service operates in this country and we are not able to predict the positive outcomes that will flow from these pieces of legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will be supporting the amendments that the opposition is proposing. They are proposed in good faith&mdash;not to wreck this piece of legislation but to improve it. That is the job that oppositions are entrusted to do in our parliamentary system and that is the basis on which these amendments will be put on the floor of this chamber and in the other place. The object of the amendments is to improve these pieces of legislation, not to wreck them. I hope the government will look at those amendments, take them on board and see that

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;This package of public service bills that the government has put before the House has been widely recognised as some of the great pieces of public employment legislation in the world. I know it has already attracted international attention. It has certainly attracted very favourable comment from expert commentators in Australia. The government is very proud of this package of legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation reflects wide consultation by the government. It embodies the results of that consultation which has taken place across the chamber and with various voices in the community. The government believes that, as amended, as it will be by the amendments which I propose to move in the detailed consideration of the bill, the bill will then embody the agreement and consensus that exists on those matters across politics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of comments made by opposition speakers on this debate are disappointing to the government because we do not believe those comments do reflect the level of agreement that there is on this legislation. The opposition is proposing to move a number of detailed amendments to the legislation. I regret the fact that such a very large number of detailed amendments is being proposed by the opposition. I suspect the opposition has received the amendments in the post from the ACTU. I would like not to believe that they reflect the considered views of the opposition on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is not going to accept the opposition amendments. We believe that the bill, as amended by the government in the course of this debate, will be an appropriate bill to provide a future framework for the Public Service. The government greatly values the Public Service. From Federation, the Australian Public Service was initiated by this side of politics. The very extensive tenure of the government benches, which this side of politics has had since Federation, and the way 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10235"> in which it has dealt with the Public Service refutes absolutely any suggestion that the coalition does not value the role of the Public Service as a fundamental institution in this society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation that we put before the House will guarantee an apolitical Public Service which is there as a fundamental institution of Australian democracy and available to any government in the future. We believe that this legislation will provide successive Australian governments with a professional and impartial Public Service that will serve the interests of the people of this country.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">In the interests of saving time, and as I indicated in my speech during the second reading debate, on the pessimistic assumption that these amendments will not pass the House, I therefore am not going to take a lot of time duplicating the debate which will take place in the Senate. Therefore, I have moved the amendments as circulated en bloc.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These amendments seek to remedy the defects to which I drew attention in my speech on the second reading. In brief, these amendments seek to impose limits, we think reasonable limits, on the powers of agency heads and, in particular, seek to prevent them from taking action which would diminish any provision of an award or a certified agree ment. The amendments also seek to ensure that advice is sought from the Remuneration Tribunal on the salary packages of agency heads and that these remain open to public scrutiny. The amendments would ensure that members of the SES continue to have recourse to the unfair dismissal provisions of the Workplace Relations (and Other Legislation) Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the interests of fairness, the amendments will extend some of the obligations placed on APS employees to APS employers. The amendments will enshrine the merit principle 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in legislation. They will expand the APS values and strengthen protection of equal employment opportunity for disadvantaged groups. They will maintain a merit based selection process for entry&hyphen;level recruitment into the APS and prevent the casualisation of the APS work force. They will maintain the APS as a career service. They will ensure that executive agencies are fully justified and meet the same accountability requirements as departments and will provide agency heads with better protection from capricious or unfair dismissal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I acknowledge, as I did in the second reading debate, that the government has taken heed of some of the criticisms of its legislation which emerged during the examination of the bills by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. The opposition welcomes those responses and, in particular, the positive response to the majority of the committee's recommendations. We also welcome the government's somewhat belated acknowledgment of the need to maintain an independent body to review employment decisions relating to APS employees but, as I indicated yesterday, we remain concerned that we have yet to see what responsibilities the government proposes to give the commissioner. I do not want to read too much into it, but I was a little concerned by such detail as was reflected in the nature of the minister's speech yesterday in the second reading debate. But we will wait until we see the detail. We are not prepared to sign off on a blank cheque, and we urge the government to provide parliament with the draft regulations relating to the commissioner's powers before the bill is debated in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The  Public Service Bill 1997  and the accompanying bills in this package are unacceptable to the opposition in their current form. If amended in the ways we propose, we believe they will achieve the objective of simplification without undermining the traditional values, ethos and professionalism of the APS. For that reason, and in the interests of brevity, I commend these amendments to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government welcomes the indications from the opposition that it supports reforms to remove the restrictions that bind the Public Service up in red tape and prevent it from operating efficiently. Unfortunately, in the amendments currently before the House I can find no indication that the opposition has really understood the need for that reform or really appreciates just what will be necessary if that reform is to become a reality. Too many of the amendments that have been put forward really do no more than attempt to reintroduce the rigidities and inefficiencies that are the cause of the current problems. The opposition seeks to regulate and prescribe, to control from the centre and to ensure that whatever flexibilities we are attempting to provide to agency heads are removed or thwarted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These amendments will reimpose a rigid, mandated, service&hyphen;wide set of outcomes that simply do not provide the capacity for agencies to tailor their operations to the needs of the clients they serve. In the course of the debate, there has been talk of the need for recognition of the foundations for a career service. The government totally supports that, but I note that under the existing legislation some 90 per cent of APS promotions take place within agencies. That is scarcely representative or reflective of a mobile Public Service, which the legislation before the House is intended to achieve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition argues incorrectly that their amendments are designed to constrain the  government from an agenda driven solely by a hatred of public employment. That comment was made in the debate, and let me reiterate the point I made in my summing up speech that this is absolute nonsense. This government values deeply the contribution of the APS to the functioning of Australian democracy. No government in this country can function without a highly professional, apolitical Public Service, a Public Service with levels of expertise which are at least equal to&mdash;and one would hope exceed&mdash;those 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> available elsewhere in the community and a Public Service with the assurance that it has the bipartisan support of all sides of this parliament. I can assure the parliament and the opposition that our agenda is to make sure that a career Public Service continues, together with the ethos that supports it&mdash;a professional and impartial Public Service that our best young Australians will want to join because it offers them an exciting and a motivating career working in the national interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, the opposition's proposed amendments would only frustrate the reforms by proposing changes such as not simply retaining but actually expanding the current anachronistic appeal system, which even the Merit Protection and Review Agency sees as needing to change. These amendments would reintroduce appeal rights for senior officers which the opposition themselves had removed in 1987. They will extend appeal rights to cover not only promotions but also  appointments when we are trying to break out of this grievance driven culture which the current regulations have given rise to. The amendments prescribe detailed and inflexible requirements for agency workplace diversity programs. These requirements impose a high level of process on agencies without in any way guaranteeing the delivery of better outcomes. I see in these amendments the dead hand of an outdated industrial relations agenda. I would like to make a comment to the opposition about the nature of this agenda: what really does guarantee security to public employees? There has been a view, a philosophy, if you like, which has permeated decisions in industrial agreements over the years. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">The government, like its predecessor, recognises the urgent need to overhaul the legislation under which public servants work. The government is committed to broadening and accelerating the process of Public Service reform which was begun in the 1980s&mdash;a process of reform which we acknowledge was initiated by the previous government. That process of reform was in response to very clearly defined national needs. It is also a process of reform which I believe was urged on the previous government&mdash;as it has been on our government&mdash;by many leaders within the Public Service itself who recognise that they want to break out of the process driven, rule&hyphen;governed culture which undermines leadership and management in agencies and which so frustrates many line public servants, including those public servants responsible for dealing with the public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Alan Kohler, a writer for the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>, says of the bill before the House:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is one of the great pieces of government employee relations legislation&mdash;simple, clear and powerful . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He goes on to say that it offers an opportunity to tackle public sector reform in `the most radical, most beautifully simple way yet'. As I have said, it has attracted international 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10244"> attention. The amendments that the government has now proposed on the advice of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, which brought down a bipartisan, agreed report&mdash;and I congratulate the committee on its work&mdash;strengthen the bill without undermining in any way the fundamental integrity of the legislation. Many of the speakers from both sides of the House acknowledged&mdash;and we welcome that acknowledgment&mdash;that these amendments improve the bill. I would like to clarify that there is already a requirement to report aggregate salaries, including those of agency heads. This reporting requirement will continue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments put by the government strengthen the bill in a number of ways. They extend the values by making it clear that the government wants an apolitical, impartial Public Service able to offer frank and fearless advice. No government&mdash;and this is the final answer to the criticisms made by those on the other side of the House&mdash;can possibly benefit from having a process for appointing its advisers which does not secure to that government the best possible advice. A government which establishes a process which leads to second&hyphen; or third&hyphen;rate advice, which provides inducements to its advisers not to give it their frank and fearless advice, is a government which in the end is damaging its own future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Consequently, the legislation that we have put forward, building on the legislation of the previous government, we believe strengthens the apolitical character of the Public Service and the incentives for senior public servants to provide governments with the best possible advice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Through the amendments we are now proposing, the bill strengthens the role of the Public Service Commissioner to review, investigate and report. The amendments provide for an independent Merit Protection Commissioner, which I think is the best possible indication of the desire of this  government to achieve wide support for this legislation throughout the Public Service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments ensure that the remuneration of secretaries and agency heads is made public, and the amendments include a definition of `merit' in the primary legislation. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> These and other amendments will ensure that we have a devolved public service, where leadership is possible, maintaining traditional values and subject to improved accountability. I commend the amendments to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

Our own amendments have already been defeated and, in some instances, we were seeking to amend the same clauses that the government is seeking to amend. We would, by definition, have preferred our own amendments, but they have already been put and defeated, so we will be supporting the government's amendments as improvements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We acknowledge that these amendments, in large part, respond to the recommendations of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. As I have indicated before, we welcome that. But, as we placed on the record in our response to the tabling of the JCPA's report on the Public Service bills, the committee's recommendations, valuable as they were, went only part of the way towards meeting the concerns that were raised by the vast majority of witnesses who appeared before the committee. Our own amendments, which we will be pursuing vigorously in the Senate, seek to respond fully to those concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will now deal with some of the government's amendments in a little bit of detail. We support amendments Nos 1, 2 and 3. We had an amendment to the same section as government amendment No. 4, and we will pursue that one in the Senate. With regard to amendment No. 5, we have no objection to the amendment but, on the face of it, we do not quite understand why the government thinks it is necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Either now or subsequently, could the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service (Dr Kemp) give some explanation of why that amendment is being put forward? It is not that we actually have a problem with it&mdash;we will be supporting it&mdash;but its rationale is not immediately obvious to us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not wish to comment on amendments Nos 6 and 7. Our amendment No. 31 dealt 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10245"> with the same matter as government amendment No. 8, but we accept that amendment No. 8 is a marginal improvement on the clause as it stands. We will be pursuing our amendment in the Senate. I have no further comment on Nos 9 and 10 today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We would appreciate an explanation of the rationale for amendment No. 11. We will be supporting it at this stage as we understand it, but an explanation would be appreciated. I will come back to No. 12, because that is the one which I want to make the most comments on. We support Nos 13 and 16. Amendments Nos 14 and 15 we support on the basis that our amendments to those same clauses have already been defeated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I particularly draw the minister's attention to our position with regard to amendment No. 12. I have commented on this a couple of times and sought his response on it, but I have not as yet received one. This is the amendment which provides for the continuation of an independent Merit Protection Commissioner, which we regard as a very positive development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We were disappointed that it was not in the original bill. We are pleased that it is now in the government's amendments. However, it leaves the vital issue of the functions of the Merit Protection Commissioner to as yet unseen regulations. I am seeking an assurance from the minister that the draft regulations will be provided to the non&hyphen;government parties in the Senate prior to the debate on the legislation in that chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our support for this amendment will depend on the content of those draft regulations. Our support in the Senate will depend on having those regulations available and on our assessment of their content. There is still potential for those regulations to be so inadequate as to render the clause insufficient to meet our concerns. But, for the moment, in the House we welcome the fact that it is a step in the direction of independent merit protection and,  therefore, we welcome it, we are supporting it, but I seek that assurance from the minister.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to respond to a few of the remarks on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R269">Public Service Bill 1997</XREF>  made by the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service (Dr Kemp) on the penultimate occasion that he spoke. Firstly, he referred to the APS as an appeal driven Public Service. I am probably one of the few members of the parliament who has actually sat on a Public Service appeals board. I assure the minister that, although it is some time since I fulfilled that function, not all promotions were appealed. I would be interested in any statistics he has.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A very small minority of appeals were ever upheld. However, like any system of justice, it is important that we are concerned about that minority. Clearly, in my experience of the appeals board's operation, it was only when the appeals board was overwhelmingly convinced of an error in selection that a decision was made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other comment of the minister's that I thought was very interesting was about the advising role of the Public Service. A very small minority of public servants are actually involved in the advising role. However, I concur with the minister that it is ultimately to the longer term detriment of any government if it is in receipt of poor advice.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10246">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given that there were changes to the contracts of permanent heads under the previous Labor government and given the rock solid notion of our system of government where there is a neutral Public Service&mdash;public servants are able with loyalty and dedication to serve governments of different political flavours&mdash;that made a break. I think it is a very dangerous practice for members of governments to seek to select people because they are his or her person in the bureaucracy, believing that they will somehow give better quality advice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I sincerely believe that the loyalty of the service at all levels is commendable. At the top levels of the Public Service there is a degree of professionalism. One of the most amazing things about our democracy is that, although at the last election there was a huge change in numbers as far as the government and this parliament were concerned, the Public Service was ready on day one to faithfully implement the policies of the incoming government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister outlined the impartiality he sees in the Public Service. I would be very grateful if he would explain why the Department of Administrative Services was abolished. There has been some media speculation that because the department advised the minister about strengthening members' accountability for their entitlements&mdash;that advice, regrettably, was ignored at the time&mdash;this was punishment. If that is the case it is pretty poor administration, but I am the first to acknowledge that Labor certainly did not leave all departments intact in its period of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of public servants advising, I reiterate that very few public servants are actually involved in a policy role. Overwhelmingly, public servants are involved in delivering to the coalface, as they say, the programs that governments have enacted and see as very important. I would be disappointed if, with successive changes of government, the incoming government had the ability to  appoint to the Public Service their own particular flavour of advisers. Governments do have undisputed authority in this area in the selection of ministerial staff. It is not only the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> quality of ministerial staff which is a key factor; another key factor is the ability of ministers and their staff to establish healthy working relationships with departments. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">There will be a number of opposition amendments to the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R270">Public Employment (Consequential and Transitional) Amendment Bill 1997</XREF>  which will flow from the amendments we moved to the parent bill. We will be moving these amendments in the Senate, and I advise the House and, through it, other members and interested people, that we will circulate those amendments to other parties well in advance of that debate. Our examination of the consequential amendments has been delayed by the need to examine the very substantial and, I might say, voluminous government amendments to this bill which were circulated on Monday. There are, however, two amendments which do not fall into the purely consequential category, that is, amendments Nos 1 and 2 circulated in my name.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first of these amendments is to clauses 6 and 7 on pages 9 and 10 of the bill. The amendment is designed to grandfather the rights currently conferred on first&hyphen; and second&hyphen;tier persons by the old act, with the exception of the right to reassessment for reintegration or reappointment which has largely fallen into abeyance in recent years. In particular, the most significant of the rights which this amendment deals with are the so&hyphen;called mobility rights: the rights of current and former public servants who are in public employment other than Public Service departments to return to employment in the Public Service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill provides for APS employees to retain their current mobility only for a transitional period. It does appear that the government is going to extend that transitional period from that originally proposed, and that is welcome. But after that transitional period, such rights will become a matter of discretion for the head of the agency to which the relevant employee is attached.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition considers that the government's proposals on mobility amount to a retrospective removal of an important condition of employment. Mobility rights have been an important consideration for many  APS employees in deciding to accept offers of alternative employment. For example, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> many former employees of the Department of Veterans' Affairs would only have agreed to move to the privatised veterans' hospitals on the condition which was promised them that they had a right of return to the APS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, it is of immediate concern to me in my capacity as member for Canberra that it may well be the case&mdash;and before this matter gets to the Senate I will do some more research, because it is a matter I have been looking at only more recently&mdash;that many current employees of the ACT government would have made decisions about their employment with the territory government on the basis that they retained rights of return to the APS. I know that initially that was the case. If nothing has occurred in the intervening period, then this would have a retrospective impact on the rights of those people, which is a cause of concern to me and will be a cause of concern to them. But we will have time to consider that in more detail in the Senate. The principle of the retrospective removal is that which we are most concerned about. It will have its particular impact in different circumstances on different individuals, and that will need more teasing out in the Senate debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are particularly concerned about the impact of the removal of mobility rights for people employed by ministers and opposition office holders under the Members of Parliament (Staff) Act. The opposition takes the view that governments and the Public Service have both benefited from the frequent movement of people between Parliament House and government departments. Parliament benefits from the knowledge of the bureaucracy that departmental officers bring with them, and departments benefit from the knowledge of the political, parliamentary and legislative processes that such people take back with them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The benefits far outweigh the slight inconvenience to Public Service managers caused by the uncertainty as to when former employees might seek to return. We believe this cross-fertilisation is actually good for our system of government and that it is something that should be encouraged rather than discouraged. It is something that should continue to receive easy and facilitated implementation 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10248"> rather than having obstacles put in the way. Therefore, I am concerned about these changes. It is that principle that led the previous government to initiate the Members of Parliament (Staff) Act in 1984. The mechanism for encouraging such cross-fertilisation is the preservation of mobility rights during the term of the so&hyphen;called MOPS employment. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> Removal of these rights will discourage such movement, and I think that not just the parliament but the Public Service as a whole, the operation of government, will be the worse for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure the ministers and other office holders here in the chamber would share my experience in six years as either parliamentary secretary or minister in which I gained tremendous value from drawing on the people who came out of the Public Service. Many of them went back into their departments during a three-year period and have gone on to discharge effective public service back in their former departments or in other departments, enhanced by their experience&mdash;not necessarily having learnt anything from me, I have to say&mdash;of being here in the parliament, being in the advisers' box, participating in those activities. I know this is not designed to stop that&mdash;and it will not stop it&mdash;but it will make it less convenient, comfortable and easy, and I think it is a mistake. I do not think it will achieve the purposes which the government is seeking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also an issue of natural justice here. Many MOPS employees have taken the decision to accept their current employment in Parliament House on the basis that they retain rights of return. Staffers know, particularly in the light of the recent changes to government ranks, that there is little security in political employment. Mobility rights compensate for this lack of security. I think there is going to be a problem in attracting the best people. It is a problem about the rights of those currently here, although the extension of the transition period seems to go some way to dealing with that aspect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government is determined to remove mobility rights, they should be removed only  from APS employees who transfer to other eligible public employment after the entry 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> into force of the new legislation in the prior knowledge that they will not have the right of return. Those who transferred on the basis that they enjoyed such rights should retain them. That is what our amendment No. 1 to clauses 6 and 7, which I have moved, is designed to achieve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will be much more brief about the second amendment, the amendment to clause 9, which is designed to ensure that provisions of existing Public Service determinations which are given continuing force by this legislation can be diminished or revoked only if those same provisions are incorporated in an award or a certified agreement. The amendment also imposes a sunset period of three years on continuing determinations. This is consistent with amendments we have moved to the  Public Service Bill 1997  which are designed to prevent agency heads from amending existing determinations covering conditions of employment in ways which diminish conditions which have been negotiated and agreed between employers and employees and incorporated in awards or certified agreements.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition proposes only two amendments to the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R270">Public Employment (Consequential and Transitional) Amendment Bill 1997</XREF> . The first amendment seeks to extend indefinitely the first&hyphen; and second&hyphen;tier mobility rights of staff. The government has indicated that transitional arrangements will be available to staff exercising those rights, but our proposal will ensure that managers will be able to manage staffing with some certainty. This is really the principle which underlies a great deal of the bill&mdash;that if we are going to get the best out of the Public Service in terms of its leadership and in terms of the motivation and quality of the workplaces within departments, we have to move away from provisions which constantly create uncertainty for the managers of the government agencies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10249">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was going to make a remark earlier about the desire for certainty and where certainty comes from in public employment. I will make that comment now so that it is on the record. There is a view that permeates the industrial relations culture in this country that certainty comes from specifying in greater detail what managers and agencies can do. The effect of this process over time is actually to undermine the institution. It destroys the capacity of managers to manage, it undermines leadership and, because the organisation becomes process driven, it undermines the quality of the work environment for those in the work environment and it increasingly inhibits the capacity of the institution to respond to the wider public and to its clients.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the effects of this process may only become clear over many years and decades, we have seen this in many institutions in this society. In the end, the pressure for change becomes absolutely irresistible. The reform that we are seeing across so many institutions in this economy is in many ways a response to the failure of this strategy to give security to people in our institutions. These days, Australia is in a highly competitive world. No&hyphen;one in this world owes us a living. What gives us security is the excellence of our own performance. It is the quality of our institutions which, in the end, provides security in this country. It is the quality of Public Service agencies and the quality of leadership in those agencies which, in the end, gives maximum security to those leaders and to the people who staff the Public Service. That is the philosophy behind this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that, in practice, this philosophy has been to a significant extent recognised on the other side of the House. It raises tensions for the opposition. On the one hand, they keep receiving advice from the ACTU that we must maintain this strategy of security through detailed regulation. On the other hand, they know, as the alternative leaders of this country, that they cannot offer the leadership they wish to when in government if this philosophy prevails. I appeal to the opposition that we have surely moved beyond that outdated philosophy and that they in government and we in government recognise the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> need for the kinds of reforms which are embodied in this legislation. Unfortunately, the amendments before the House do not recognise that change. They are an attempt to justify that out&hyphen;of&hyphen;date philosophy and the government does not support these amendments.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a couple of remarks on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R270">Public Employment (Consequential and Transitional) Amendment Bill 1997</XREF> . On the issue of mobility, it is absolutely vital that we are able to give public servants the opportunity to work in ministers' offices. When we look at the situation of ministers versus shadow ministers there is a degree of inequality in that, for example, DLOs are effectively on loan from the department to the minister and their subsequent return is not a problem&mdash;as the member for Canberra (Mr McMullan) pointed out. I hope that the minister at the table, the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Dr Kemp), has not lost the experience of being in opposition. It is very important that an opposition&mdash;who compared to a government have a great inequality of resources at their disposal&mdash;also have the opportunity, should they choose, to have members of the APS working for them in an advisory role.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only is it oppositions or government ministers who benefit from these arrangements but also the individual garners a degree of experience from the exercise. As the member for Canberra pointed out, it benefits that individual in their subsequent career. Whilst that is not prohibited under these arrangements, it is made more difficult&mdash;particularly if that public servant is working for a shadow minister. The government ought to take a second look at it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was interested in the remarks the minister made about certainty. I do not think that certainty is the biggest problem in the Public Service. I can remember trying to deal with a problem in my electorate of people, who fall under his portfolio responsibility, who do not fit into Skillshare or any of the other available labour market programs and had a variety of problems. We actually got then Minister Baldwin to come out there. The 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10250"> people we needed there were from nine different departments, both federal and state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Probably the biggest challenge in the Public Service is the fact that so many programs are singular and program driven. Whereas, to effect a solution where there are cross&hyphen;portfolio responsibilities and trying to coordinate those on the ground, back in electorates, is so difficult. Then you have federal, state and sometimes local government overlaps. The bill does not address these issues. I believe the real challenge for the future is how you deliver programs that are not singular portfolio programs but are ones which have this federal&hyphen;state overlap as well.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the amendments be disagreed to.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I want to make some general comments and then I will go through each of the 10 particular amendments and make some specific comments to those amendments. At the conclusion of a speech given by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) on 11 December 1996, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill 1996 represents a landmark development in the conduct of fiscal policy and reporting of fiscal outcomes. It is the kind of reform which, when enacted, will change: the way in which elections are conducted; the way in which policies are implemented; the way in which future generations are brought into consideration in economic decision making; and our economic policy for the better.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The situation now is that we have had 10 amendments proposed to us from the Senate. We believe the legislation, which we brought into the parliament, fulfils the changes which we believe will happen from this charter of budget honesty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think all members are aware that this piece of legislation has been introduced due to the fact that at the last election the previ 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="10308"> ous Labor government had been assuring Australians that the accounts were in balance. However, when we came into government there was a $10.5 billion deficit. As the Treasurer said, we inherited this problem. It has become our responsibility to fix it and the mismanagement which the then government sought to hide. We believe that this bill will achieve that outcome. It is for those reasons that we are rejecting each and every one of the proposed amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment No. 1 broadens the principles of sound fiscal management to include a whole range of aspects of Australian life, and they are listed in the amendment. This amendment is unnecessary as these issues are already, and we believe more appropriately, covered in clause 4 of the bill. That clause provides that fiscal policy should be directed to maintain the ongoing economic prosperity and welfare of the people of Australia. In the amendments there is reference to full employment, overall economic prosperity and welfare of the people of Australia, maintenance of improvement of real wages and so on. We believe that clause 4 covers that, so it is unnecessary to have that clause amended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment No. 2 requires that this report be prepared annually. Clause 12 of the bill already requires that material threats to the fiscal outlook, quantified where feasible, be outlined in a statement of risks. This requirement would unnecessarily add to this statement. Secondly, the amendment also draws the attention of tax planners to weaknesses and the anomalies in tax legislation risking larger losses in revenue than would otherwise be the case. The timing for this statement is also difficult as loopholes would be identified at the same time as the budget, which really is the major point at which revenue decisions are generally made. To alert tax planners to some of the difficulties which governments face would not be very wise at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment No. 3 requires an intergenerational report to be produced within three years instead of the five which is mentioned in the bill after the commencement of the act and thereafter within three years of the public release of the preceding report. It is not appropriate to require the release of reports at 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a greater frequency than five years as the assessments of the long-term sustainability of policy are unlikely to change quickly. Assessments in an intergenerational report will be more affected by factors such as demographic change and Australia's long-term growth potential rather than short-term budgetary and economic developments. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> Also, the bill only prescribes a minimum reporting frequency, and that does not prevent governments from releasing reports more frequently if appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment No. 4 requires responsible secretaries to jointly release a pre-election economic and fiscal outlook report two years and nine months after the first sitting day of the House of Representatives following the previous election. If an election is called before then, a pre-election economic and fiscal outlook report would be required within five days of the issuing of the writs for a general election. Our response to that sort of proposal is that, in the case where a report is produced two years and nine months after the first sitting following an election, the amendment would allow economic and fiscal developments in the subsequent months prior to an election announcement to go unreported. This would be inconsistent with providing up&hyphen;to&hyphen;date information on the economic and fiscal output to the electorate prior to an election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case where an earlier election is called, preparing a pre&hyphen;election economic and fiscal outlook report within five days of the issuing of writs is impractical. A minimum period of 10 days is required for a report to be produced. I think that is important in that there has to be some reality to legislation which is brought into this place and the requirements on governments. To do something within five days is really impractical. Even 10 days is going to push either side, whoever they might be, to do that task. That is the reason we are rejecting that clause, along with the other reason mentioned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment No. 5 requires ministers to not participate in the pre-election economic and fiscal outlook report other than to provide needed information. Briefly, the amendment is not necessary as the bill already requires that the Treasury and Finance secretaries must 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10309"> sign off on the report stating that it reflects the best professional judgment of officers of their department. Amendments Nos 6, 7, 8 and 9 will allow the possibility of the departments of Treasury and Finance costing unannounced policies for the government and opposition in the caretaker period prior to an election. I emphasise that it is unannounced policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, the amendments allow for the making of requests for costings by the Leader of the Opposition to be authorised by the Prime Minister but that the details of the policies being costed need not be disclosed to the Prime Minister. They also provide that the details of policies which are the subject of a request by the Leader of the Opposition shall not be disclosed by the secretaries to the departments of Treasury and Finance to anyone not authorised by the Leader of the Opposition. The secretaries may decline to prepare costings under any request where they consider that policy advice is being sought.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe the amendments will result in the loss of transparency in the costing process and that that lack of transparency from the amendments is also inconsistent with clause 31 of the bill. This clause requires that all policy costings are made public by the secretaries to the departments of Treasury and Finance as soon as practicable before polling day. As requests for the costing of unannounced policies would be permitted, requests could made for a range of alternative policy options to be costed. This risks placing the departments of Treasury and Finance in the position of developing policy for the opposition inconsistent with the usual conventions. It could also add substantially to the workload of departments which could be required to cost a myriad of alternative options.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last amendment, amendment No. 10, requires that policy costings must indicate that assumptions have been used and explain any limitations on the methodology used. This amendment is unnecessary as costing guidelines issued by the secretaries to the departments of Treasury and Finance for the preparation of policy costings provided for in subclause 31 would detail such processes. So it is unnecessary and would be redundant to do so.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition finds it very disappointing indeed that the government has taken the course just indicated by the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) of opposing all the amendments produced by the Senate to the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R425">Charter of Budget Honesty Bill 1996</XREF> . The opposition, outright to 10 highly reasonable, highly sensible, long debated, carefully debated amendments agreed to by the Senate, shows that this charter of budget honesty is not the brave and brilliant new contribution to integrity in government and enhanced quality of democracy that it is claimed to be by the government but is rather a straight-out political stunt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government simply do not want to entrench a superior system of accountability with this legislation. They want to give the appearance of reform but they do not want to deliver its substance. And they certainly do not want to do anything that would operate even&hyphen;handedly as between the government and opposition of the day and, in so doing, enhance the quality of democratic debate and accountability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The clearest demonstration of the points I have been making&mdash;there are many ways that I can make the points and I will on the way through&mdash;was the rejection by the government of our proposal in the Senate right at the outset that the charter be legally binding. The way it is drafted at the moment, the legislation is not enforceable at all through the courts. There are no penalties at all for non-compliance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We attempted in the Senate to make the charter enforceable. The government has refused to accept that position. The government itself in doing so has acknowledged that really the whole charter is optional. The notion of an optional charter of budget honesty, while entirely consistent with the optional approach to honesty that this government has adopted in its last two budgets, does make a farce of the government's rhetoric in this area. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10310">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second demonstration of our good faith in all of this&mdash;before we come to the actual amendments&mdash;was our proposal in the Senate for the budget documents to contain, among other things, an estimate of the effect of the budget measures on national savings. The Treasurer (Mr Costello) has repeatedly taken other occasions to tell the House&mdash;I note again that he is absent from this debate as he so often is when matters of this kind are being debated in this place&mdash;that the overriding objective of budget policy is to increase the level of national savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Surely, in legislation which purports to be designed to improve budget transparency, it is not unreasonable that the government be asked to attempt to quantify the effect of its budgets in achieving such a key objective. The government, however, succeeded in excluding this key measure that we are proposing from the legislation. Whereas previously it recruited Senator Harradine to defeat the earlier matter I referred to, on this occasion it recruited one of the Greens, Senator Margetts, who I think took the view that anything to do with saving transparency was a form of economic rationalism and therefore to be treated with the utmost suspicion as a result. But, whatever the reason, we lacked a majority on this particular amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The key point I am making about the government's response is simply this: what was the government afraid of in putting a provision of this kind into the legislation? We were perfectly happy to have information included in the budget documentation about what the estimated effect on savings would be. Why was the government opposed to such a fundamental proposition? What is the Treasurer afraid of? Why shouldn't the public be able to know what the effects of the budget are on national savings? Why shouldn't the Treasurer then be held accountable to whatever targets are included?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unless the government has answers to these questions, it really approaches this whole debate with no credibility at all. I invite the parliamentary secretary to give those answers now on this occasion, if he feels so minded to. But if he does not feel minded to, as he has just indicated, I will continue by now 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> turning to the specific amendments before the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The first amendment goes to the `principles of sound fiscal management' so-called that are set out in part 3 of the bill. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> This amendment is fundamentally important in terms of the objectives of the government&mdash;we believe of any government. We believe that fiscal policy should be directed to worthwhile community goals not just accounting outcomes. Why do governments set fiscal objectives? They do so to ensure that broader objectives can be achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we wanted to do with Senate amendment No. 1 was to add to the principles of sound fiscal management, as set out in clause 5, a minimum of two further paragraphs, which are very familiar because they are contained within the Reserve Bank legislation as to the obligations which the bank has to take into account in its role in relation to monetary policy. The amendment in question requires accordingly the government to have regard to, firstly, the achievement of full employment in Australia and, secondly, the overall economic prosperity and welfare of the people of Australia. Those principles do add a humanising element to the principles of sound fiscal management rather than presenting fiscal management as wholly a matter of fixation on accounting bottom lines, which is the case with the present bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course it is appropriate that a statement of principles of fiscal management recognise, address and require commitment to those accounting criteria. That is absolutely fine. We do not want to remove them. But it is also the case that they should recognise that the application of fiscal management techniques has a very real impact on the lives and welfare of people. For people's welfare to be enhanced and for their prosperity to increase, there has to be a focus on the achievement of full employment and there has to be a focus on the achievement of economic wellbeing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The pursuit of better employment outcomes should be a key priority of this government. It hardly needs me to point out on this occasion&mdash;but, nonetheless, I will do so&mdash;that that has not been the case, that the government's 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10311"> record in relation to employment has been absolutely woeful and this does represent the biggest economic and social problem now confronting this country. We have not even stayed still on the jobs front; we have gone backwards since this government came to office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was the creation of an employment committee of cabinet to deal with this issue. That whole enterprise has been an utter and spectacular failure. What these amendments seek to do is simply, without labouring that point any longer, compel the government to focus on these key issues of national welfare, as they are obviously not doing at the moment, and to do so in a budgetary context, as they are obviously not doing at the moment. I frankly regard it is as unbelievable, and I think the community would regard it as unbelievable, that the government would not accept this amendment, because to do so indicates as clearly as anything possibly can that they simply do not support improved employment and national welfare outcomes; they do not see that as part of any government's budget or fiscal responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second amendment, which we would also very much want to see embraced and adopted, is also a very important one which we would hope would have the unanimous support of the members of this House. The integrity of the tax base is absolutely fundamental to the delivery of adequate public services. Taxes are obviously necessary to finance public services and these are most fairly raised when everyone able to contribute does in fact contribute in a fair and honestly administered system. Ensuring the integrity of the tax base is therefore crucial to ensuring that taxpayers are all paying their fair share.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What amendment (2) does is simply require the Commissioner of Taxation and the Secretary to the Treasury to provide a report on any material threats to the integrity of the tax system, including the fiscal impact of any of these threats as a permanent and as an integral part of fiscal reporting. This is obviously an important proposal because it will allow the government, and especially the Treasurer, to be held accountable for the conduct of tax policy. There can be few duties of higher 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> importance for the Treasurer than to maintain a fair tax system. As I have said, it is absolutely critical to that that the current tax base be maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are concerned to ensure that the concerns, as they evolve in the revenue authorities, are made public to enable scrutiny of the Treasurer's performance in his duty of protecting the public revenue. The tax commissioner can advise the Treasurer on matters that should be undertaken to maintain the tax base, but, as things stand at the moment and no doubt will remain, he has no power to force the Treasurer to act in the national interest. The discretion is all with the Treasurer to either accept or reject the advice of the tax office and the Treasury, all in comfortable secrecy. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That secrecy, of course, is what the Treasurer like the present one relies upon to act against the advice, solemnly and sincerely given on occasion, by his tax office and by his own department. There has been no clearer demonstration of the Treasurer acting in this way than in relation to the family trusts tax rort which the Treasurer has now allowed to continue, as a result of his initial announcement on 13 May this year, has now embraced in legislation which we were debating here last week and to which I have been referring ever since in question time. The continuation of an exemption for injections of income by non&hyphen;beneficiaries in family trusts to enable them to, in effect, traffic in trust losses and pay no tax on income derived by them in completely separate circumstances from those relating to the trust itself is one of the more extraordinary and indefensible tax avoidance loopholes to have been left open in recent times.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no public policy justification for it. There has been none articulated in this place. It is manifestly against the advice of the Treasury and the tax office. We know that, not least because advice on this issue was very squarely given to the previous Treasurer, Ralph Willis, in our government. There was no question of us allowing that particular exemption or loophole to continue. This government has chosen to do so. We can only speculate as to the reasons for it&mdash;that it is of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10312"> manifest benefit to high wealth individuals in the community as a whole, that it is of manifest benefit to the up to 19 members of this government's frontbench who do in fact have family trusts. I mention that not in order to, again, make a meal of it in the context of the present debate, but to indicate how important it is that threats to the integrity of the tax system be openly identified, as part of a system of fiscal reporting of the kind that this legislation says it stands for, where all of this is open and transparent and where it is designed to improve the quality of public administration, and in particular fiscal administration, in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment that the Senate proposed does not seek to alter the Treasurer's right to make tax policy on behalf of the government. What it does do is seek to ensure that material threats to the tax system, not least those created by the actions of the Treasurer himself, are codified in a systematic and public basis, so as to enable the performance of the Treasurer in dealing with these revenue threats to be much more openly and readily evaluated than is the case at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course it is the case that future Treasurers will still be able to refuse to act on the advice of their revenue authorities, but they will not be able to hide their actions or their lack of actions, they will not be able to hide the nature of that advice and the fact that they are not complying with it from the Australian people. And if you are serious about budget honesty, that is exactly the kind of thing you ought to be prepared to put into this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clause 12 of schedule 1, as it is currently worded, only includes some references to the sorts of risks that may have a material effect on the fiscal outlook. There is a reference in very general terms. What is not there&mdash;and this is the nub of the argument for this amendment&mdash;is an explicit reference to particular threats posed to fiscal outcomes due to the integrity of the tax system coming under sustained attack.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the Senate, in opposing this measure, Senator Kemp made two particularly ludicrous claims which ought to be acknowledged on the public record. His first ludicrous claim 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> was that the few pages of information that do now exist in the statement of risks in Budget Paper No. 1 actually cover this issue. This is absolute rubbish. What we envisaged is that this independent statement by the bureaucrats will not be the generalised language of the kind that has been traditional in that section of Budget Paper No. 1, but, as I have said, a much more detailed statement about specific schemes and specific issues which will complement the broad information that has already been provided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, Senator Kemp advanced the ludicrous notion that publication of information about schemes or other threats to the tax base would in fact increase their use. The point is that the tax office does not dream up theoretical schemes. What the tax office and Treasury do is detect taxpayer behaviour&mdash;often many years, unhappily, after it has become established practice&mdash;and then advise the government of the problems and the possible solutions. It is simply wrong to suggest that the tax office could advise, by this means, the tax industry on ways to avoid tax. In practice, of course, it is absolutely the other way around; the sequence of events works quite differently. If the proposition that is contended for in defence of the government's position here were to prevail, the tax office would never take any taxpayers to court on the basis that a loss would alert taxpayers to possible schemes. Clearly, that is utterly absurd and at odds with current practice. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we do know is that the tax system and the threat to its integrity is under constant and sustained attack. In some instances this is as a result even of the government's own legislation directly opening up loopholes or deliberately leaving them open. Again, I refer in that context to the family trust losses legislation before this parliament. In other cases it can arise through a lack of action on tax avoidance through such means, for example, as allowing salary repackaging by senior public servants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that the risks to the integrity of the tax system are always going to exist. It is a recurring problem that every government has to confront. We do believe in that context 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10313"> that one way of ensuring that those risks are properly dealt with is to ensure that the government can be held accountable for inaction. That is the point of this amendment. That is why we insist upon it. That is why we are very disappointed, and I think the community will be very disappointed, that the government has taken the path that it has.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can be briefer about some of the remaining amendments, but not necessarily all of them. Amendment No. (3) goes to intergenerational reporting. This amendment changes the frequency of the proposed intergenerational fiscal reports from five years back to three years. This one was actually moved by the Democrats but it was supported by us in the Senate. What it does is to ensure that there will be such a report, in effect, during every normal term of parliament&mdash;at least once in the life of that parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reporting framework of three years that is here proposed does in fact align with the other long-term fiscal report which is already presented to this parliament, namely, the report by the government actuary into the long-term costs of the Commonwealth civilian and military superannuation funds. Those reports are prepared every three years and we consider this to be taking into account that kind of precedent&mdash;an appropriate interval for updating reports to be released. We hope very much the government reconsiders its position on that amendment. But all the available evidence is, of course, that it will not and that is unfortunate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendments Nos (4) and (5) both relate to the pre&hyphen;election economic and fiscal outlook report which the legislation proposes to require. What amendment No. (4) does is seek to replace and improve the proposed provisions for a pre-election economic and fiscal outlook report that is published prior to an election. The bill itself proposes, as the parliamentary secretary said, that within 10 days of the issue of writs for an election the responsible economic bureaucrats produce a report to inform the electorate of the economic and fiscal outlook as it is likely to be after the election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment proposes that instead of waiting until an election is called, in the case 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of a parliament that looks likely to see out its full term, that report should be published in the normal way two years and nine months after the first day of sitting of a new parliament. If an election should be called prior to that time, then we argue in the amendment that the report be produced not within 10 days but five. We moved this amendment for the very simple reason that if a pre&hyphen;election economic and fiscal report is to be published, then for it to be genuinely useful and genuinely contribute towards public debate, genuinely enable policy commitments and so on to be reconsidered in the light of the information which it contains so that better promises, more credible promises are made, such a report needs to be available on a very timely basis, as soon as is practicably possible. This system should certainly not be set up in such a way as to enable such a report to be used as a political tactic by the government of the day simply in order to advance its own political agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously, the later such a report is released the more beneficial it will be to the government and the less opportunity it will allow to the opposition to consider its position in the light of it. The opposition and other non-government parties, and Independent members, will be denied a reasonable time in which to respond to the issues and possibly adjust policy on the basis of the issues that the report has raised. It is a matter of weighing and balancing on the one hand, as the parliamentary secretary has said, the point that you want the outlook report to be as accurate as possible, and always the later you leave such a report the more accurate it is likely to be in forecasting, predicting or projecting a course of events in the future. But that really does, in our judgment, have to weighed off against the obvious advantage to the government of the day in having such a report dropped as late as possible&mdash;because you very well know all along the material that is embodied in it, even if it is not publicly made available&mdash;and, on the other hand, the adverse impact this has on the political capability of the opposition. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am indebted to the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) for making that point. There can be no more important legislation, frankly, before this parliament at the moment and I am frankly determined to say what I want to say, succinctly, but, nonetheless, with the necessary degree of detail to make the point as to why we are going to divide on these amendments and why we are going to insist upon them. We could, of course, have the potential here for a double dissolution piece of legislation. It is only reasonable under these circumstances, should the Senate insist on these amendments&mdash;as I hope it will&mdash;that the public be well informed as to what the issues are.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been making the point about the reason why we want these reports to be produced as soon as possible&mdash;in order to keep some serious balance between their utility to the government of the day and the opposition. There is a practical question, as the parliamentary secretary said, as to whether they can be prepared within five days as distinct from the 10 days in the legislation. I am one of those people, after 13 years as a cabinet minister, who has a great confidence in the capacity of the bureaucracy, not least the Finance and Treasury bureaucracy, to do what is necessary in these situations. They keep this data prepared on pretty much a rolling basis and I have absolutely no doubt whatsoever that they can produce credible and effective reporting within five days. The point is that if the government is serious about presenting timely and relevant data to allow a fully informed electorate, then the opposition's amendment should, here as elsewhere, be supported.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment No. (5), which is associated with this&mdash;it is again a Democrat one&mdash;proposes to ensure beyond doubt that ministers are forbidden from participating in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the preparation of a pre-election economic and fiscal outlook report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From the way it is set up in the legislation, it is apparent that it is the intent that this report not be a political document but a genuinely objective assessment by capable bureaucracy as to what the outlook will be. If that is the intention of the government, there should be absolutely no reason why the government would reject making clear that that is the intention, in a bipartisan way, by agreeing to this amendment. If the government are opposing this amendment, they are conceding that they support the possibility of political interference; and, again, that is something that I think is utterly at odds with the title of this legislation and its purported role in improving the quality of government in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendments (6) and (7) go to the heart of the opposition's concern here about this legislation. They concern requests about the costing of election commitments. The particular amendments sought by the Senate are very short in terms of their verbal impact&mdash;they require only the deletion of a couple of words from two separate clauses&mdash;but they are enormously significant in terms of the substantive impact of all of this. They go to the heart of the question as to whether this legislation is really concerned to improve the quality of public administration and democratic debate in this country, or whether it is really all about just giving political advantage to the government of the day. I hope the coalition, given its current political fortunes, might just stand back a little now and think about what it would be like for it to be in opposition contesting an election in 4&half; years time, as no doubt it will be with these particular provisions confronting it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me explain what I mean. Part 8 contains the proposed costing regime. Clause 29, at the moment, is the major clause which sets the ground rules for the costing of election commitments after an election has been called during the so&hyphen;called caretaker period. The government have been very devious in framing these provisions. They are pretending that they are improving access to the costing resources of the bureaucracy&mdash;the economic 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10315"> departments&mdash;when they are proposing to create a very, very severe set of practical and political difficulties for the opposition of the day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the form in which the  Charter of Budget Honesty Bill 1996  was introduced, only publicly announced policies can be costed, that is to say, the opposition has to formally announce a policy before it is entitled to get a cost estimate from the bureaucracy during the caretaker period. There is no provision at all to get costing advice earlier than the caretaker period. It may, of course, be the case that official costing indicates that the financial impact of the policy is significantly different from that which has been assumed by the opposition. Even the most competent opposition with the resources available to it does find it very, very difficult to produce estimates of economic and financial impact of a lot of measures with anything like the same precision as is possible for a bureaucracy. That is just in the nature of affairs; it makes no concession about our inadequacy or the inadequacy of any opposition. It is just a reflection of reality. We say that, under those circumstances, it is simply not reasonable to force an opposition to publicly announce a policy about the precise fiscal implications of which it may be unsure. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The further political dynamic that, of course, will operate here is that, if the opposition has publicly announced policies&mdash;as it will indeed have to, given ordinary political realities&mdash;the mere existence of this particular clause in the legislation will create a source of political pressure for the opposition to seek a costing of it from the bureaucracy, even though the dynamics are such that nobody can be sure what the outcome of that costing will be or the political consequences of a costing that does not conform with the opposition's own estimates. So it is a very neat little dilemma that has been constructed for the opposition of the day. I do not think that it is, in any way, an inadvertent consequence of this legislation. I am absolutely sure it is a deliberate consequence of the way in which the legislation has been crafted.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If it is not a deliberate intention, the government ought to be prepared to listen to&mdash;as the Senate did&mdash;and think through what we are proposing by way of amendments and act graciously and decently accordingly. If you are serious about this being a piece of legislation designed to improve the overall quality of public administration and the overall quality of democratic debate and democratic accountability, you would not be a creating a legislative regime which has in&hyphen;built necessary disadvantages for the opposition of the day. We happen to be the opposition of the day at the moment. It is not going to be very long before you, the coalition, find yourselves in exactly that situation and you will be just as worried about the imbalance and unfairness of this once you are in this particular situation. So I ask you, in all seriousness, to listen carefully to what I am saying.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that this legislation does massively favour the government because the government has access to the economic bureaucracy resources continuously throughout its entire tenure in government simply by virtue of being the government. That means that the government can refine, to its heart's content, its proposed policies with the assistance of costing advice from those departments without any question of those policies having to be publicly announced. You can test them; you can work out the costing implications; you can refine them; and you can change them without having to go through the business that the opposition is being forced to by this requirement that policies be publicly announced. Sure, the public announcement criterion applies equally to the government once you are in the caretaker period, but a government, by virtue of being a government&mdash;even one as incompetent as this one&mdash;would obviously have all those tasks well and truly done before it takes the step itself&mdash;it is in its hands&mdash;of calling the election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The effect of the bill is to force the opposition to release publicly its policies before they are costed if we want them to be costed or if we are under the kind of pressure which means that they will, in effect, be thought to have to be costed. It is fraught with danger 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10316"> for any opposition to be forced to announce policy decisions on the basis sometimes of quite incomplete information which exposes it to real political disadvantage. This particular provision is of no advantage to the opposition, but it is of tremendous benefit to the government, and that ought to be understood by anyone who is trying to work out what this debate is all about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our amendments&mdash;the Senate amendments&mdash;simply seek to inject some equity and fairness into this costings business so that the government and the opposition have access to advice on costings, regardless of whether the policies have been publicly announced or not. Ideally, we would have access to such advice earlier on in the electoral term rather than just being confined to the caretaker period. That was not to be, in terms of the Senate's willingness to embrace that, but at least the legislation would be very substantially improved by this amendment being carried for the caretaker period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment (8) goes to the question of pre&hyphen;election costings as well, but it seeks to remove from the Prime Minister the discretion, which is presently granted in clause 29 of the bill, to decline a request from the opposition for a costing to be made by the relevant departmental secretary, and to eliminate the proposal, which is there in the original bill, that the Prime Minister should actually be given a copy of the opposition policies concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We say that it is entirely inappropriate in the first place that the government, through the Prime Minister, should have any discretion on the question of whether or not opposition policy costings are to in fact proceed. It surely should be the case that, if those costings are to be done, they should be done free of government influence, and free of the perception of influence, in the interests of proper and open public debate, not in the interests of the government of the day. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment does recognise that there are some Westminster formalities to be observed, and it incorporates a requirement that access to the economic department secretaries is still through a request made to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Prime Minister. However, what amendment (8) does achieve is to remove the requirement that the Prime Minister be provided with a copy of the policies to be costed. There is no requirement under our amendment of disclosure of the relevant details, and that is exactly as it should be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment (9) adds two new subclauses, 29(6) and 29(7), which will grant the responsible secretaries a discretion to decline to provide advice where this would include policy advice. This amendment is a clear demonstration, I hope the House will acknowledge, of the opposition's good faith. We would find useful, I guess, policy advice coming out of the bureaucracy in the guise of a costings exercise. But, just as it is not appropriate during the caretaker period, as is accepted on all sides, for the bureaucracy to provide policy advice to the government during that period, so too, we think, in the interests of even&hyphen;handed public administration, it would be inappropriate for policy advice to be able to be provided to the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are saying in this amendment that the discretion should be left in the hands of the relevant departmental secretary whereby if, in the secretary's opinion, he or she considers a request to be more in the nature of one seeking policy advice than a policy costing exercise, he or she can rightly decline to undertake the request to the extent that it encompasses policy advice. That will ensure that the bureaucracy is not compromised between serving the government of the day and providing information to the opposition that has a policy character.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A further change that the opposition seeks via new subsection (7) is to ensure that any request made by the Leader of the Opposition to seek a costing is in fact private so that the opposition, at least during the caretaker period, if not earlier, has the same advantage as that of the government. If the government is truly committed to the democratic process as much as it continues to pretend to be, then this measure ought to be embraced by the government because it does obviously seek to introduce some balance by ensuring that not only the government but also the opposition has access to professional and private advice 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10317"> with regard to policy costing matters. It does fly in the face of the kind of decent, fair&hyphen;minded, even&hyphen;handed regime for opposition costing processes to be denied privacy in this sense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The provision in clause 31 of the bill requires costings, when actually done, to be made public. Ideally, the whole process would be private but, if the work has been done, and is done during the caretaker period, we are prepared to accept the continuation of that obligation to do it publicly. However, at least the opposition&mdash;if the earlier amendment is accepted of the policies not having to be publicly announced before the costing is done&mdash;is in a position, under these circumstances, to be able to treat the publicly given costing advice as simply an option to be pursued rather than something to which the opposition has to be committed beforehand. When you add all these things together, we say the balance comes out as a fair one and it would be reasonably workable in practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, amendment (10) goes to how policy costings are to be prepared. This amendment is again from the Democrats in origin, requiring that the assumptions upon which those costings have been made are spelled out when a costing is provided. It is simply an improvement in the transparency of the costings process and, as such, it is supported by the opposition. If the government was halfway decent on this, as on anything else, which it is not, it would support it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that we are now going to have the government reiterating its opposition to all these amendments. I hope, nonetheless, that some light has dawned in the mind of Mr Miles, the parliamentary secretary in this respect, that there will be a Damascene conversion evident and that he will announce a complete policy change. I will not, however, hold my breath.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">These amendments go to the heart of most of the contentious matters in respect of the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1997. I will attempt to be brief so we can deal with these matters if possible before question time.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government set out with these amendments to introduce matters which were merely technical&mdash;in other words, we were at pains to ensure that this bill did not contain policy proposals that would provoke undue, unnecessary controversy, because the matters which were included in the bill were technical things just to make easier the operation of the policy behind the existing Workplace Relations Act. We sat down, for example, with the ACTU in the Committee on Industrial Legislation, which is a subcommittee of the National Labour Consultative Committee, and we pulled out a few of the amendments that we were considering on the grounds that we wanted to keep the thing on a technical basis. Clearly, some matters relating to Australian workplace agreements would be opposed by the opposition parties because of their concerns about the policy but, again, we have kept the matters to technical issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of deliberations in the Senate, amendments were moved and carried in the Senate which go to other policy issues. To keep the matter to the technical issues&mdash;which has always been the intention of this bill&mdash;the government will vote to not support certain amendments made by the Senate. Senate amendment No. 1, for example, raises very substantial policy issues in respect of award coverage vis-a-vis Western Australia. This arises out of differences of opinion about state law in Western Australia&mdash;the second wave or the third wave. Regardless of one's point of view, the fact is that these are not technical issues and we do not support these proposals. There are policy reasons as well for why we do not support them, but I do not intend to go into those now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senate amendment No. 2 would permit a court, in addition to ordering the reinstatement of a dismissed employee and payment of compensation for loss suffered as a result of dismissal or other prejudicial conduct, to make any other order it considers necessary to remedy the effect of a breach of section 170MU and any consequential orders. Suffice to say that the amendment is unnecessary and the government does not support it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment No. 13 arises out of a proposed amendment, which the opposition Senate 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10324"> amendment has omitted, which did not alter the meaning or operation of subsection 152(5). In other words, we had an amendment up and the Senate has omitted that amendment. The point I make in response to that is that what we were doing made no change to the meaning. You could not get a more technical amendment than this one. Our amendment was simply intended to avoid any uncertainty about the operation of subsection 152(5) by including the word `state' before `relevant award'. That is all there is to it. I do not believe that should be a matter of any controversy whatsoever. It is basically a typo, in layman's language.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendments Nos 14 and 15 both go to the issue of whether or not people should be paid when they are taking industrial action. These amendments are an attempt to water down the provisions of the Workplace Relations Act, which basically says that, if you take industrial reaction&mdash;whether it is a strike, bans or limitations&mdash;you do not get paid. We are obviously not in favour of watering down those provisions. Those amendments have obviously been moved by the opposition, and the Democrats would support them because the unions would tell them they do not like provisions which prohibit the payment of strike pay. We obviously do not support that proposition from the opposition and the Democrats. It flies in the face of the system we have put in place, which is fair to both employees and employers and includes penalties against employers who pay people for taking industrial action. Employers are half the problem when it comes to the incidence of strike pay in Australia, and it is one of the reasons we have a very high level of bans and limitations in this country. That is the thinking behind amendments Nos 14 and 15 and the reasons we reject them.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The problem with this whole approach is that it reflects the government's difficulty in handling its relationship with the Senate altogether. A large set of technical amendments were put forward and overwhelmingly carried. Some matters of policy significance were carried, some of them over our opposition but with the support of the Democrats. Therefore, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the government substantially got its way. We did not like what it did about strengthening the powers of the Employment Advocate, but it has been passed. We did not like what happened with prohibiting people from pursuing remedies for unlawful termination in some circumstances, but it has been passed. We did not like some aspects of or what happened with disamalgamation, but it has been passed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government got a substantial part of what it wanted and is now heading back for some sort of small or large collision with the Senate. It is not exactly of great magnitude but, nevertheless, it is some sort of collision over the small number of losses it had. As someone who was Manager of Government Business in the Senate in a previous life, happily passed, it seems to me that that is not an efficient way to handle government relationships with the Senate. If it continues, this is not going to be the high point of the problems it causes in the relationship between the government and the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The  Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill  has blended legitimate technical changes over most of which there was no difference. Even though a few were substantially technical, there were small disagreements with some policy matters, some things which the government put in which we regarded as policy substance&mdash;some of which we were significantly opposed to&mdash;and some amendments which have policy implications. We want to pursue those amendments. Not all of the amendments which the government is opposed to are ones initiated by the opposition, but they are ones which we supported&mdash;clearly, or else they would not have passed&mdash;and which we think ought to be persisted with. I will go through and indicate them quickly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment No. 1 is one which, although we did not initiate it, was moved by the Democrats and supported by everybody in the Senate other than the government. It is similar to a matter introduced into this House by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) by way of a private member's bill. It is an important question with regard to the relationship between state and federal unions and state and federal legislation. They want to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10325"> now get into all the complexities being debated here and in the Senate at length. But I think it is right, in principle, and makes the operation of the act&mdash;whatever we think of the act overall&mdash;fairer and more appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can understand the policy differences we have on that matter. The government does not agree with us in policy on that matter, so we will vote and agree or disagree. I cannot understand the government's concern with amendment No. 2. It seems to be the most straightforward of matters on the face of it where the range of relief for employees unlawfully terminated for engaging in protected industrial action should be the same as for employees unlawfully terminated on other grounds. I do not understand the government's position on that. There does not seem to be a matter of policy principle involved that ought to motivate them to be as concerned about it as they seem to be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Greens amendment, which is amendment No. 14, is, I accept, important and worthy of support. We do not like the government's policy about strike pay but, once again, that is the law of the country and it is there. It is a very strange situation where we are actually saying to people, `Don't do part of your job; do all of it or none. If you're at work being productive right through your shift but not doing all those things requested or required, you can't be paid.' All that means is there is never going to be any more work to rules. Everybody is just going to go on strike. It does not seem to make any sense at all, but the government has this very narrow view. It is fixated by it and it seems to be persisting with it. I think it is profoundly wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot get very excited about amendment No. 15. We will support it, but it is a matter of very little consequence. It was not initiated by us. We support it. We continue to support it, but let me not exaggerate its significance. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> Amendment No. 13 is one which I do regard as important, and it was where a government amendment was defeated. The Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) seems to say it is of no consequence. We have had this discussion here in the House and in the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Senate. It is not our view that it is of no consequence or a mere typo. It never was. It still is not. It is our view that it does have consequences with which we do not agree.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The existing provisions provide that state employment agreements are able to override federal awards, provided the employee is not disadvantaged in comparison to entitlements provided by the relevant federal award. Whatever I think about that policy matter, that is what the existing law says. The government's defeated amendment would have allowed this override to occur if the employee is not disadvantaged by reference to any relevant state award. This is not a standard with which we are comfortable to see incorporated in the federal law, particularly given the standards set by some of the current conservative state governments and those in prospect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In regard to neither the principle of the federal law operating in that way nor its practice in the readily foreseeable circumstances of state governments such as Western Australia today&mdash;whose industrial relations policies are so abhorrent to this side of the House and, fortunately, to many Australians, particularly to very many Western Australians since their post&hyphen;election amendments which they ran through the Legislative Council prior to the result of the election taking effect and preventing their having the numbers to do so&mdash;should we take lightly this question of the reference being to a relevant state award. That is not something that we regard as merely technical, nor is it something that we will lightly allow to proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a lot of matters incorporated in all the amendments which we could all speak about at length because they are issues that are important to both sides of the House. We disagree about them, but we share the view that some of them are important and are matters on which we would normally wish to have a longer discussion. To facilitate the proceedings of the chamber, and because we debated them twice before&mdash;and, on the face of the evidence, we are likely to do so a fourth time in the Senate&mdash;I will not speak any longer. I simply indicate the opposition's view on all those matters.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to speak in particular on amendments (14) and (15) and touch on amendment (13) of the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R271">Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1997</XREF> . Essentially, from the government's perspective, amendments (14) and (15) try to override those no work, no pay cases. In the early federal Gapes case the Federal Court determined that, just because bank employees had refused to perform a relatively minor part of their work in circumstances where the employer acquiesced in their staying on the job&mdash;indeed, was happy with them to stay on the job and wanted them to stay on the job to perform their other tasks&mdash;they were not precluded from their payment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the other hand, there are numerous cases, particularly in the New South Wales state jurisdiction, where employers have directed the workers to go home. The employers have said to their workers, for instance, `If you're not prepared to fulfil the full range of your contract of employment, I don't want you here on the job. Please leave the premises.' In those cases the courts have said that the employer has accepted their breach of contract and is not liable for payment of their wages. That is fair and reasonable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) has said that in recent years there has been an increase in industrial action by way of bans or limitations. I have not seen figures to know whether that is right or wrong. But there is a danger&mdash;and I think it is an event which will necessarily follow&mdash;that, instead of bans and limitations, which can often be more in the nature of protest action rather than necessarily extremely damaging to business, you are going to have workers simply downing tools, or downing pens as it were, and leaving the workplace altogether. So the real risk here, and I think it will follow, is that, instead of having relatively trivial bans and limitations, actual stoppages will occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Workers would be silly, I would submit, to stay on the job if they were to get no payment whatsoever. So it may well be a situation where the employer would prefer to have the employees on the job at least doing the better 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> part of their productive duties rather than compelling a situation where they go home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is, effectively, a government coming over the top of what might be an arrangement desired by both the employer and the employee. Not all industrial action is bad. Not all industrial action is caused by employees, which seems to be the starting point from the government's reference. Often it is desirable to let workers blow off a bit of steam, have a bit of a protest, and then get back and sort the issue out. They feel as though they have had an input when a common result is achieved. Often a good way of achieving an outcome is through a trivial sort of protest, through a low level work ban. So it is inappropriate for the government to come in over the top.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Effectively, the government is imposing its own liquidated damages on what could be a trivial breach of contract. The government would not do that in any other commercial relationship. It would not say, `We're going to assess the damages in this case, the damages being equivalent to whatever that worker's rate of pay is.' The government is effectively intervening in a contractual relationship which it would not dare do in respect of its own constituency or commercial base that tends to patronise them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been a number of articles written on this no work, no pay concept. Professor McCarry from Sydney University, for instance, has written several articles.

He was, by any measure, one of the most profoundly influential public servants that the Australian nation has seen. Not only did he leave his mark in areas of public administration, most particularly in the economic area, but also he had a very profound influence in the direction of policy on indigenous affairs. He had the rare distinction of somebody who was counted as a close adviser and confidant of prime ministers on both sides of the political divide in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

Prime Minister, isn't it a fact that because of your government's massive budget cuts to the Customs Service only 20 customs officers work on the Sydney wharves, which handle hundreds of thousands of containers each year? Isn't it also a fact that only one container in each major port around Australia is checked each day or, put another way, three in 10,000?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question asked by the Leader of the Opposition is about as relevant and about as accurate as some of the wild allegations made by the Premier of New South Wales, whose only contribution to the fight against drugs is to pass the buck and to not accept any responsibility of his own. Fighting drugs is a national responsibility, and those responsibilities have to be shared between the Commonwealth and the state governments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would refer the Leader of the Opposition to a statement issued yesterday jointly by the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs. In the course of that statement, the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs says that customs resources devoted specifically to anti-drug efforts have not been reduced during a time of general budget expenditure reductions. In the 1996 budget the government provided $26 million in additional funding over three years for technology specifically to aid in drug detection and interception, painting a completely different picture from that attempted by the Leader of the Opposition and from that attempted by the Premier of New South Wales. Furthermore, the minister went on to say that the 1997 budget provided funding for an upgrade in the capability and capacity of the Customs marine fleet. The total cost of purchasing the boats will be $55 million over a period of 10 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I would say to the Leader of the Opposition is that, if you are really interested

The reality is that&mdash;and increasingly, as time goes by, it will be written of this period in Australia's economic history&mdash;the measures that have been taken by my government since it came to power in March of 1996 have provided to the Australian nation additional economic insurance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What those measures have done is to strengthen the infrastructure of the Australian economy. What those measures have done is to better arm the Australian economy to withstand the harmful shocks abroad because of adverse economic developments. What those measures have done is to make the Australian economy more competitive. What those measures have done is to enable the Australian economy to play a significant and positive role in the regional economic affairs at a time in our history where all Australians, whatever their political beliefs, regard a deep 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10330"> involvement in regional economic affairs as being of fundamental importance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very instructive to note that not only did those opposite leave us with a vulnerable economy but they tried to stop us repairing the vulnerability. It was a double economic crime on the people of Australia: you leave us with a mess and you try to stop us cleaning up the mess. We have undertaken these measures in the face of ferocious opposition from those who sit opposite, whose only mantra is whatever it takes to score a political point; it does not matter about the national interest, hang the national interest and hang waterproofing the Australian economy against the ebbs and flows of adverse economic circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We inherited a deficit of $10&half; billion. Over the last two budgets we have created the circumstances where at the end of our first term in government we will have an underlying surplus in the budget of the Commonwealth account. That is a remarkable achievement. More important than being a remarkable achievement, it has given to the Australian economy a strength, a resilience and a protection against adverse circumstances from abroad. I think all Australians when they pause and reflect upon the events of the past few weeks will have occasion to say, `Thank heavens we had a government that was willing to take some difficult decisions. Why on earth did the opposition try to stop them doing it? Why on earth did the opposition try to stop the government cutting the budget deficit? Why did the opposition oppose measures that have brought interest rates down in Australia by 2&half; per cent? Why has the opposition opposed measures to privatise Telstra so that Australians can directly join in the ownership of Telstra? Why has the opposition tried to frustrate the legitimate attempts of the government to defend the jobs of Australians in relation to the greenhouse gas issue?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On greenhouses gases, the Labor Party for weeks was deriding my attempts to defend the jobs of, amongst others, mine workers in the mining areas of Australia. I had occasion when I was overseas to draw attention to a rather humorous leading article in the Man

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We and the public have been subjected to an awful misinformation campaign emanating from the opposition. Mr Carr says that $110 million is being cut from budgets.

He put out a press release yesterday saying that Australia's law enforcement agencies have had their budgets cut by more than $225 million over four years. Where did he get that from? It does not exist. He roams around the country saying to the public that, if Labor had been elected, there would have been $80 million more, therefore, there has been an $80 million cut.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Menzies for his question. He may not be aware that the figures on goods and services released today for the month of September show that the balance was in a surplus of $408 million, well above market expectations of $195 million. The balance on goods and services recorded its sixth monthly 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> trade surplus, rising $90 million compared with August, with a growth in exports of 1.3 per cent, more than offsetting modest growth in imports of 0.4 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure all Australians will welcome the fact that the accounts have been in surplus over the last six months. That does not mean that Australia will not be beset with a current account deficit. What it means is that we are now trading in surplus, but we will continue to run current account deficits as we continue to try to service the foreign debt which the Labor Party built up over 13 years of mismanagement of the Australian economy. But the good news is that we are now trading in surplus, and it was the sixth in a row.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that members of the House will welcome the fact that the DEETYA skilled vacancies, which were released today, also showed a rise in trend terms of 3.9 per cent in October, the strongest monthly increase in nearly three years. So we have the DEETYA skilled vacancies showing good strong rises and we have the trade on the external account being in surplus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are welcome signs of strengthening in the Australian domestic economy. But, as the Prime Minister said, we have to make sure not just that we are taking into account the domestic economy but that we in Australia are putting in place the steps which will give us insurance against external shocks which we as a country have no control over, one of which we have seen in recent months in relation to the South-East Asian currencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we said repeatedly over the last two years, to be in a position where the Australian budget was $10,000 million in deficit would have meant that we were exposed and fragile. To be in a position where we had no measures to cope with current account deficits which had bedevilled the Australian economy through the 1980s and 1990s would have meant that the Australian economy was exposed and fragile. The events of the last couple of months have reiterated the importance of government getting the domestic settings right, of making sure that we get our house in order, rather than rely on work being done overseas.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are very important steps in relation to the Australian economy.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I announced yesterday after my meeting with President Suharto is justifiable and ought to be strongly supported by Australians on a number of grounds. The first ground is, may I say, national self&hyphen;interest. It is in the national self&hyphen;interest of Australia to have strong regional economies. It is in the national self&hyphen;interest of Australia to help where it can strengthen an economy as large and potentially as powerful as that of Indonesia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The measure that I announced was designed not to prop up a regime but to help the Indonesian people. The measure that I announced was a demonstration of regional neighbourliness; I describe it as regional mateship. It was a desire on the part of my government, and I hope on behalf of most shades of political opinion in Australia, to demonstrate that, when a neighbour and close friend is in difficulty and you have the economic strength which this country has&mdash;and I am very proud of the fact that my country does have the economic strength to help and to play a part, and I am very proud of the measures that my government has taken to give us that strength&mdash;and you are faced with a situation like that, the right thing to do in the national interest and in the long-term interests of the region and our role in the region is to make the commitment that I made yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does not&mdash;as I hope the honourable member, on reflection, will understand&mdash;amount to an outright gift as, with respect, your question implied and as you implied in relation to Thailand. What I indicated was that we would be prepared to participate in facilities organised by the IMF. I want to take the opportunity of making it clear that any involvement by Australia will be subject to the arrangement being supervised by the International Monetary Fund. I made it very clear to President Suharto in my discussion yesterday that we would expect Indonesia to comply with all the conditions laid down by the International Monetary Fund. Those

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;By the time we came to government we had an industry in a mess. It was divided, demoralised and going broke. In very difficult circumstances I convened two historic round tables involving every sector of the industry here and internationally, and we hammered out jointly a plan for recovery. And action followed that plan. We as a government committed ourselves to withdrawing from the industry and setting it on a path of self&hyphen;destiny. We abolished the four per cent debt tax. We opened up the fixed release schedule. We rewrote Wool International's charter so that their responsibility became one of maximising the value of the industry instead of maximising the value of the stockpile. We put in place a program to phase down and then wind up Wool International, a statutory corporation which will no longer be needed when its task is completed. We set up a committee to look at wool contamination&mdash;to tackle that vitally important issue once and for all&mdash;and the member for Wannon is a valued member of that committee which is about to report. The government, and especially the Minister for Trade, Tim Fischer, have worked extraordinarily hard on opening up new opportunities for this very important industry, including tariff free access to the United States via Mexico and lower barriers in China and India.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The result is an industry in recovery: the stockpile down to 1.4 million bales, the debt now under $500 million, net assets of around $800 million against which growers can now borrow and prices in recovery. That recovery is based quite clearly on a restoration of confidence. A major wool user recently said to me that the trade now has restored confidence in the Australian government and the Australian industry, and that is in stark contrast to the chaos of John Kerin's reign, when the words `immutable' and `cast&hyphen;iron' were not worth the paper they were written on.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, we are not going to sit on a park bench. But the government did have a 3&half;&hyphen;hour meeting last night with the MUA, the AMOU and the ACTU. We issued a joint press release after it, which is probably a feat in itself. The press release actually had the telephone numbers of the MUA on the bottom of it, upon their request, which is a minor matter but it shows you that we are prepared to, at least, work to some common outcome.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This morning when Mr Coombs came in to do a radio interview a member of my staff actually met him at the Senate door to make sure he got there. It is certainly unusual for the government to be inviting members of the MUA into the parliament. Prime Minister, I will give you a full briefing later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We did have a very frank discussion and we did canvass a lot of the issues. As I said to Mr Coombs in no uncertain terms last night, the government is absolutely determined to see a significant improvement in productivity on the waterfront. We do not resile from that and we are very determined to press ahead with it. That is not to say that we do not believe that we have an obligation to talk. We do believe that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last night we spent a lot of time literally laying it out in a frank way with the MUA, making it very clear to them what we believe the industry should be aiming for and the means by which that objective should be achieved. I also made it clear to Mr Coombs that we do not believe that this matter can be talked and talked about without result. Our view is that sitting down and genuinely talking about it is fair enough, but we do need to see some real progress and we have agreed to meet in a few short weeks before Christmas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true that there was one area where I think that there may be some common ground. That is on the question of safety. We tabled the Easson report. We gave them a copy of it last night. I think that they would 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10340"> have to accept that, based on that report, the safety record in the industry is not good. We do need to set some general objectives about trying to improve safety for the people who work on the waterfront. I think that they will in due course, as they digest that, see that point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst they are prepared, I think, ultimately, to see that point, they are not prepared to accept the idea of benchmarks in respect of industrial action. I say to John Coombs, `Listen, John, industrial action on the waterfront is 10 times the national average,' and he says, `Don't be confrontationist; don't provoke us.' I say to him, `The crane rates are shocking, John. Look at New Zealand. Can't we do as well as New Zealand?' and he says, `Don't you be provocative. Don't you confront us.' I say, `And, John, you are undermining the reputation Australia should have as a reliable supplier,' and he says, `Well, when you say it then the world knows it.' So we are undermining the reputation that we ought to have for reliability. Even as we were debating these issues last night, the newest addition to Australia's merchant fleet arrived to berth in Geelong and could not get in because of industrial action being taken in Victoria in which the MUA was, effectively, participating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fairness, it was a frank discussion and John Coombs said as much this morning. I welcome that. That is a step in the right direction. That is good, as far as it goes. No&hyphen;one is kidding themselves about the likely results of those discussions, but we are prepared to give it a go. We are prepared to talk to them. We encourage them to, for starters, acknowledge that there is a problem. And there is a problem. It is a big problem. Beyond the problems, what needs to be understood is that, if we could have a good waterfront, we would have more jobs created in the Australian economy and higher export incomes, and that would be better for everybody. It is a start, but I say to the MUA that the days of denial are over and we have to have a pathway to doing a lot better on the waterfront. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matters before the Anti&hyphen;Dumping Authority at the request of Monsanto dealt with allegations of dumping between 1990 and 8 November 1996. Therefore, a meeting proposed to be held in October 1996 to discuss future arrangements is obviously irrelevant.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will make another important point. The Anti&hyphen;Dumping Authority, under the legislation introduced by Labor, is required to consider the domestic pricing arrangements in the country of manufacture and compare them with the prices in this country. This particular meeting that you are referring to was about export pricing. In fact, in the memo `export' is mentioned five times and `domestic' not at all, so it really is completely irrelevant. That was the view taken by the Anti-Dumping Authority, which was set up to provide independent advice on these sorts of issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will make one final point in relation to this matter, and it is a very critical point that is highlighted right at the commencement of the report. Perhaps the member for Hotham might like to go and read the Anti&hyphen;Dumping Authority report on this glysophate issue. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A fundamental feature of a valid complaint about dumping has got to be the issue of local content. There must be 25 per cent of the factory cost of the good attributed to the cost of production in Australia.

Minister, my electorate of O'Connor is participating in the exciting economic growth arising from development projects in WA such as a $1.4 billion steelworks in Geraldton. Minister, local employers have already asked for and received coalition government assistance to train local workers but have concerns that additional skilled workers will be needed to ensure their participation in lucrative contracts. Minister, what government initiatives are in place to address this good news problem?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="10341" SPEAKER="Ruddock, Philip, MP" NAMEID="0J4" ELECTORATE="Berowra" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Immigration and Multicultural Affairs" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0J4">Mr RUDDOCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for O'Connor for his question. Of course, it is the government's priority to get Australians into jobs but, where skill vacancies cannot be filled from the local and the Australian job market, employers do need flexibility. We have recognised this. There are some regional areas of Australia where it is especially hard to fill vacancies for highly skilled positions. If you have these unfilled, of course, it can jeopardise opportunities in projects of the type that the honourable member for O'Connor referred to, and that can put the job opportunities for other Australians at risk as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have supported a number of schemes to enable employers in regional areas to bring in skilled migrants where they cannot fill the positions locally. We have done that through the local regional development organisations, which are given authority to certify the shortages that do exist. I am pleased to be able to announce again that we have in fact appointed a number of additional organisations to fulfil this role as regional sponsored bodies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They include the Mid&hyphen;West Development Commission of Western Australia based at Geraldton, which will have authority to approve nominations under that scheme. I have also approved the Great Southern Development Commission in Albany, the Pilbara Development Commission based in Karratha 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10342"> and the City of Port Macquarie Chamber of Commerce in New South Wales. These organisations will assist significantly in filling these sorts of vacancies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is to also commence on 1 November a new scheme involving state and territory governments, which will be able to sponsor up to 200 skilled migrants and their families in the independent skilled category. They do have a very positive impact upon the economy. They bring young skilled people with English language competency, and that assists greatly with the economy. I think it is a very significant demonstration of the way in which the government is assisting regional Australia in development, and it is ensuring that there is greater public confidence in the immigration program by obtaining a better dispersal of the migration intake.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10343"> Those links were extended this morning with the IOC when commissioners Dr Jacques Rogge and Monsieur Francois Carrard, together with John Coates of the Australian Olympic Committee, took time out to visit Canberra and meet me and my ministerial colleagues.</PARA></TALK.START>

That stands at the moment at around $700 million. This includes up to $290 million by way of rebate to SOCOG of income and sales taxes. I think it is a very real manifestation indeed of the clear goodwill on the part of the Commonwealth government to make sure that the job SOCOG has to perform gets done.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Hinkler for his question. I note for the benefit of the House that the member for Hinkler is rapidly building a very strong reputation of concern for job opportunities for young people in his electorate. I understand that he has recently launched the `Young Australians want to work' campaign in his electorate, organised by Rotary International in conjunction with the Australian Youth Policy and Action Coalition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This campaign which I launched nationally on 4 September encourages employers, particularly small businesses, to hire more young unemployed people by taking advantage of the government's initiatives for the unemployed. The government provided some 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10346"> $32,900 for the production of a video, the core component of this campaign. I understand that the Rotary Club of Gladstone Midday, working with the local CES, has been successful in encouraging local employers to lodge vacancies for young people. In fact, as a result of this campaign, a total of 63 vacancies have so far been lodged with the Gladstone CES: 24 positions are for new apprenticeships, 17 positions are for full-time work and 22 positions are for casual employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This very important and valuable program by Rotary is still in its early stages. I encourage Rotary clubs around Australia to participate in it, as the member for Hinkler's local Rotary club has done. I am sure that young people will benefit greatly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It complements the government's campaign to increase the number of new apprenticeship opportunities for young people. This week some information was mailed out to 2,800 secondary schools around Australia, highlighting the opportunities available for young people in new apprenticeships in industries such as communications, telecommunications, multimedia, tourism and hospitality. A further mail-out to 60,000 employers, promoting the benefits to their business of taking on a new apprentice, will go out in November. I am pleased to report that there has been a continuing positive response to this new apprenticeship marketing campaign with some 9,000 inquiries so far.</PARA>

Under this government, traineeships continue to expand at a very substantial rate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The failure of the government to prevent the recent influx of heroin and other harmful drugs as a result of federal budget cuts to the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Customs Service which has led to the unnecessary death of hundreds of young Australians.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to approach this matter of public importance without all the histrionics that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> were demonstrated in this place this afternoon by those on the other side who purport to be the government of this country in responding to very legitimate questions that we as an opposition raised. I would also like to approach this from the point of view of the invitation by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to have some sort of a bipartisan view on the fight against drugs in Australia as to how we might achieve that. At the outset let me suggest one of those remedies to the Prime Minister immediately&mdash;that is, restore the funding cuts to both the AFP and the Australian Customs Service that were in the 1996 budget delivered by his government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think anyone in this place, particularly anyone who has a family, has not been touched by the ravage that is the drug menace of our society today. It seems almost every day we read newspaper stories or we see television footage of somebody collapsing in the street, whether it be in Sydney, Melbourne, Hobart, Perth, in country New South Wales or in country Victoria. If people are quick enough to get the ambulance service there and if that ambulance paramedic is quick enough to administer the antidote, we see the person who has OD'd revived.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The OD'ing that is taking place is quite often these days on heroin. Why? Because heroin is flooding this country. The Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs (Mr Truss) would have to admit himself that, where people can go into suburban Sydney, suburban Perth and, dare I say, even suburban Brisbane and buy a hit of high-grade heroin for between $5 and $7, there is something wrong with the detection systems in this country. Where people can buy heroin at a cost that is actually less than the cost of a packet of cigarettes&mdash;which we stand up in this place and talk about, which we put barriers in front of, which we ban the advertising of and so on because they are seen as being a health risk&mdash;there is something wrong with the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Customs Service, the Australian Federal Police and state police forces generally speaking are men and women devoted to the task&mdash;the task of drug enforcement programs, drug detection programs and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10350"> programs of prosecuting those people who would trade in illicit substances. Those people are not super men and women. Those people cannot be expected to fight this fight against this menace to society when resources are constantly cut.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs is going to get up in this place shortly, refer to some of his budget papers and say, `But we have actually increased the money.' That is not true; it is simply not true. If you have a look at the figures for the Australian Customs Service and for the Australian Federal Police, you can see that their budgets have been cut on both occasions. For example, the Australian Federal Police budget has been cut by $37.6 million in the last two years. Over the coming short period of time, that will equate to a loss of at least 100 Federal Police agents in this year alone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Commissioner Palmer recently admitted, the AFP is now capable of undertaking proactive operations against only one of the seven or eight major crime rings at a time. In the AFP 1996&hyphen;97 annual report, for example, it was stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With reducing budgets and fewer people . . . the number of tasks the AFP must place `on hold' or reject because of lack of resources will increase. There is also an increasing opportunity cost to the AFP's clients and stakeholders, and ultimately Australia, of the amount of crime falling within the AFP's jurisdiction that will be allowed to continue unimpeded, and remain uninvestigated and undiscovered.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It does not just stop there. The Commonwealth Director of Prosecutions' budget has been cut by $14.6 million over the next four years, reducing its ability to prosecute criminals who are caught by the AFP. The National Crime Authority's budget has been cut by $7.4 million in last year alone and $20.4 million of its reduced budget over the coming years will not be available for the war against drugs. As a result of the cuts, the NCA, which targets the activities of organised crime, now has only a notional presence in South Australia and Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet the government and the Prime Minister stood up in this place this afternoon and said, `We are prepared to put resources into the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> fight against crime. We are prepared to put resources into the fight against drugs.' In what way are those resources going to be applied? He is going to have a talkfest at the next COAG meeting with his colleagues from the various states and say yet again, `Premiers, how can we approach this issue?' Quite frankly, his ability to approach this to date has been absolutely abysmal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I return again to the figures. As I said, the minister is going to rely on his interpretation of the figures, but I just refer him in respect of the AFP to Budget Paper No. 1 of 1997-98 and Budget Paper No. 1 of 1996-97. If you look at those two tables and rationalise them, you can actually see that the AFP budget has been reduced by $96.7 million over the years 1996-97 to 2000-01 as against what the budget might have been had it been maintained at the 1995-96 level of $201.6 million. Those figures can be demonstrated and I would be more than happy to table the documentation that proves that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is something else which is important in this debate, that is, the amount of illicit drugs coming into this country is on the increase. The Australian Customs Service annual report, tabled in this parliament only yesterday, detailed the large increase in the volume of drugs seized. It is important and instructive for people to listen to this. The Australian Customs Service intercepted 169 kilos of heroin in 1996&hyphen;97 compared with 64 kilos the previous year; 68 kilos of cocaine in 1996&hyphen;97 compared with 58 kilos the previous year; 24,296 kilos of cannabis in 1996&hyphen;97 compared with 53 the previous year; and 75 kilos of ecstasy in 1996&hyphen;97 compared with 31 kilos the previous year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure honourable members would all agree that this is an impressive increase. There is no doubt about that. As I said to the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs and as I say again now, the dedicated men and women of the Australian Customs Service&mdash;those who are left&mdash;are working in a part&hyphen;time capacity, regrettably, between 9 and 5. As my colleague the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) will outline with respect to the port of Port Kembla, under your administration, Minister, since your government came to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10351"> power, the number of people working at Port Kembla for the Australian Customs Service has been slashed from 14 down to five. They work between the hours of 9 and 5 and then they disappear. Do the drug pushers clock off at 5 o'clock?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You say, `We will have a flying squad come in if we suddenly hear through the intelligence unit that there might be drugs coming into Port Kembla.' As my friend the member for Throsby is going to point out, the trouble is that as the flying squads come into Port Kembla, the drug pushers are going up to Sydney to sell the stuff. They pass each other on the freeway. How do you explain that, Minister? The simple fact is that the cuts to the Australian Customs Service are all so substantial. The Australian Customs Service's budget has been cut by $79 million over the coming four years.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Ha, ha!</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8I4">Mr MARTIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Have a look at your own budget papers, instead of shaking your head and mock laughing. I refer the minister&mdash;he has only been here for five minutes&mdash;to the Senate estimates committee meeting of 3 June 1997 where your own Comptroller General of Customs said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Last year the government took a decision to slice $50 million over three years off Customs. Last year it was $9.2 million or $9.4 million and that goes to $20.8 million this year, and I think we have had our fair share.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Dead right. That was your own Comptroller General of the Australian Customs Service complaining about the cuts to his own organisation. As I said, you have only to look at the major ports around this country to see what the problem is about the importation of drugs. With the sniffer dogs and the intelligence units, and the way in which Australian Customs Service works effectively with overseas agencies to trace some of those movements into this country, they get only about one in five, and the four out of five which they miss are bringing in massive quantities&mdash;quite obviously by the amount that is now on the streets. If there has been an increase of drugs coming in in the last 12 months to two years and the seizures have gone up, it is because 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> there is more being imported into this country which is going undetected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> One of the most insidious problems faced because of the drugs coming into this country is the effect it has on families. I recently attended a drug summit in my home town of Wollongong with some very well meaning people. I listened in absolute horror as former drug addicts told their stories of buying heroin and crack, and stories about snorting cocaine&mdash;it did not matter&mdash;and stories about cannabis being the start and how they progressed to heavy drugs, the stories from police officers who tore their hair out saying that, because of resources and restraints being imposed by governments, they could not do their job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a parent I sat there in absolute horror because I have heard the stories from my own kids' school. Kids aged 13 and 14 in year 7 and year 8, because of peer pressure, have to carry around little sachets of cannabis. Some carry around heroin because of that peer pressure. What is more alarming than anything is that we are seeing that no longer only in high schools; we are seeing it in the primary schools. In Australia, we are now getting reports of kids as young as 10 years of age being exposed to the drug problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You might all laugh and think that this is nonsense. Go and talk to the people who work with the drug rehabilitation units around this country. Talk to them and get the names and addresses of some of the parents whose kids have been turned on to these illicit substances and see whether it is true. Talk to some of the former users, talk to some of the people who are scrounging money together to go to places like Mexico to get some exotic method of getting off heroin addiction and other things. See whether or not those stories are true. Do not just take our word for it, either.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we tend to do in this place quite often is say, `The government produces statistics, the opposition goes and finds something different from the information that is there, they read the Australian Customs Service annual reports and come to different conclusions.' Let me report on a very extensive study that has been done very recently as a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10352"> PhD thesis by Mr Hank Prunckun on the use of narcotics in this country. What he has found is that there were 1,700 kilos of heroin imported into Australia in 1996&hyphen;97, which had a retail value&mdash;now hear this&mdash;of $2.9 billion. He found that the amount of heroin seized in Australia by law enforcement agencies ranged from 3.5 per cent to 20 per cent&mdash;as I said, one in five. By a process of deduction, that means that at least 96.5 to 80 per cent of heroin imported into Australia ended up on the streets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the more interesting points that Mr Prunckun found was that the average street prices had fallen for heroin and that the purity had increased. If the government does not believe me on this, I am quite happy to table the statistics contained in that PhD thesis, which clearly demonstrate and indicate the rate of importation of illicit drugs into this country, the values and the prices associated with those drugs and the devastating consequences that they have on the lives of Australians. I seek to table that information.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regrettably, this is a government which is soft on drugs. This is a government that is putting the lives of Australians at risk. It is a government that slashes resources to the Australian Customs Service, to the Australian Federal Police and, by inference, to the New South Wales and other state police forces around Australia, yet it says it wants to get serious about drugs. The Prime Minister 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> wants to have a talkfest. The Prime Minister was against the drug program that was proposed for the ACT, and as a consequence it fell over.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A discussion on drugs is indeed a matter of public importance, and these sorts of subjects should be on the agenda for discussion in this parliament often. The honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) spoke about some desire for bipartisanship on this issue in his opening remarks, but throughout his entire address he resorted to petty party politics and attempts at cheap point scoring. Labor has waited until the last sitting day before the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is about to announce important new initiatives in this area to even bother to come into the House to raise the issue. They are so ashamed of their own record that they make a belated, last minute attempt to feign some interest in the issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are also suffering a good dose of embarrassment because of the outbursts of the New South Wales Premier, Mr Carr, on these matters. He is running off with all sorts of figures about budget cuts&mdash;entirely different, I might add, from the figures used today by the member for Cunningham and by Senator Bolkus in the other place. If members on the other side are going to make up some figures, it would be rather handy if they got their act together and sorted out what reductions the government is being accused of in this area. The facts are that the figures are a fantasy, contain an element of economic illiteracy and contribute absolutely nothing to the debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been disappointing that the New South Wales government has shown such a reluctance to be involved in cooperative measures and to talk with the other states and Commonwealth agencies about what can be done to address the drug problems in that state and, indeed, in the whole of our country. It is well known that much of the drug related activity in Australia is centred around the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10353"> New South Wales capital and that there are a number of major operations in that state. So it is absolutely essential that New South Wales is a partner in any effective program that we might have in addressing the enforcement issue in particular.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Drugs are indeed a serious issue for all Australians. To suggest that this is a new problem, a relatively new influx into our country, is impossible to justify, but it is without question that the problem continues to raise its head. Whatever amounts of drugs are available in our country are too large, and we want to do what we can as a government and as a community to address issues of supply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, it is also important that we address education issues. If we can reduce demand then the requirements for enforcement will be fewer. The Prime Minister's package, which will be announced later this week, will be very even&hyphen;handed in that regard. It will address the importance of education and the importance of encouraging young people to have confidence in themselves and in their capacity to achieve and not to resort to drugs. It will have an emphasis on enforcement and on ensuring that we do what we can to reduce the flow of illicit drugs into this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are not only problems in relation to heroin and illicit drugs of that nature; we must also address issues such as alcohol and tobacco related problems. The previous government endorsed a program some time ago which, at the time, was alleged to deal with a range of drug related issues. Sadly, it has retreated much more these days into dealing with things such as alcohol and tobacco&mdash;not that those are not important problems, but it is clear that we must also address major issues such as heroin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not want political stunts. We do not want empty name calling, as has been happening from the New South Wales Premier when in fact New South Wales has played a very limited role in many of these issues. I was interested that Mr Whelan, who has been making many comments as the New South Wales police minister, has shown a positive disinterest in being involved in the Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy. I understand that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> there have been 15 meetings of the Australian Police Ministers Council since he has been the minister and that he has bothered to attend just three.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even when he was there, I am told, his contribution to those meetings was very paltry indeed and he has made very little contribution towards these sorts of issues. It is clearly a low priority issue for the New South Wales police minister and, whilst the New South Wales government slash into their police budget and into their capacity to undertake effective operations against heroin and other illicit drugs, they try to turn the focus onto Commonwealth agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth stands ready to work with New South Wales and with the other states to mount an effective campaign against the entry of illicit drugs into our country, and also to ensure that effective education programs are in place so that young Australians&mdash;indeed, all Australians&mdash;look for alternatives than resorting to these sorts of props.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look clearly and in some detail at the issue of how much is actually spent by the government on Customs matters. The member for Cunningham foreshadowed in his MPI speech that I would quote the budget figures. Of course, I am going to quote the budget figures because they are an obviously reliable guide to what is being allocated in this particular area. The Customs budget this year is $422 million; last year it was $403 million; and the year before that it was $390 million. That does not sound like cuts to me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Earlier today, we heard references in question time to the annual report of the Australian Federal Police. I notice that the opposition did not choose to make any references to the annual report of the Australian Customs Service, even though it was released only yesterday, because it really is a proud record of achievement. In its annual document, the Australian Customs Service reports a remarkable record of success. We can proudly acknowledge the work and effort of Customs officers around Australia. These days, they are working smarter. They are relying much more on intelligence and technology to ensure that they know where to look.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10354">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The nonsense being quoted about how many containers may be physically searched from top to bottom is really an irrelevance. If you are going to start looking for needles in haystacks, you are certainly going to need a cast of millions and very often be unsuccessful. It is far more important to rely on technology, intelligence and analysis so that, when we go looking, we know what we can expect to find. We are much more likely to succeed in those sorts of efforts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These days, foot&hyphen;to&hyphen;foot barriers around the whole coastline of Australia would not be very effective. What we need to concentrate on is advanced technology and using our resources more wisely and well. That is what this government has done. In our budget, $26 million has been provided over three years for technology, specifically to aid in drug detection and interception.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1997 budget provided the first instalment of an upgrading in the Customs marine fleet, as the Prime Minister referred to in question time today. Customs now has the capacity to undertake surveillance up to 300 nautical miles off the coast. These sorts of initiatives are achieving real results.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not working alone. Last weekend I was in Mackay and I met the Customs staff on the ground in a regional centre. They were able to report on the effectiveness of two Customs programs that I think are of enormous value. With the front&hyphen;line program, Customs works in cooperation with importers to endeavour to develop intelligence and to get access to the sort of information that is likely to lead to results. One excellent example of that front&hyphen;line program occurred in Mackay last year when 20 kilograms of cocaine were seized from a bulk ship. This was an example of Customs working cooperatively with the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have our own version of Neighbourhood Watch, the Customs Watch program, where people in the community are invited to provide information to Customs. That has been enormously successful. In areas such as the Torres Strait, where clearly a major surveillance task needs to be undertaken, we also rely heavily on local people to assist in that work. That sort of thing has helped to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> provide a much more effective and cost efficient barrier for our country to help stem the flow of drugs and other unwanted things into our nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Cunningham suggested that these strategies were failing, and he even had the temerity to suggest that the Australian Federal Police Commissioner had concerns in this regard. I refer the member to yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> where Commissioner Palmer stated categorically, as the headline says, `Drugs fight not failing: police'. The article says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian Federal Police Commissioner Mick Palmer has rejected claims by NSW Premier Bob Carr and his Police Commissioner Peter Ryan that federal authorities were not effective in keeping heroin out of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The commissioner went on to explain much of the AFP's achievements in that regard. The responsibility for the Australian Federal Police is the responsibility of my colleague Senator Vanstone in the other place. Both Senator Vanstone in the other place and the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) today identified that, firstly, the sorts of statistics quoted by the opposition in relation to cuts in the Australian Federal Police budget are false&mdash;they are completely wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today, Mr Williams outlined the details of the efficiency dividends and the improvements that have been made in the administration of the AFP. Also, in the Australian Federal Police, the delivery of these savings is focused on administrative efficiencies and does not significantly impact on the AFP's important operational work and capability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The AFP is managing its expenditure to ensure that it maintains its commitment to important operations and activities within the projected budget allocations for this financial year. The AFP has in place a national prioritisation framework, which ensures that all matters are properly and appropriately assessed and prioritised according to available resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has also commissioned a review of the financial practices of the AFP to provide a solid foundation for future resource considerations. The government is providing an additional $505,000 to the AFP 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10355"> to allow it to undertake preliminary work on security for the Sydney 2000 Olympics. Nearly another $1 million over three years has been allocated to provide for the AFP adjustment scheme, a scheme supporting initiatives for broader anti&hyphen;corruption measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government and the AFP are working together to ensure that AFP resources are effectively utilised. We need to be vigilant in our fight against the arrival into this nation of products, materials and drugs that no&hyphen;one wants. We need to achieve those sorts of objectives by improved technology, improved intelligence and improved analysis of the information available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If Labor is interested in cuts in staffing numbers, perhaps it could explain why the Customs Service was slashed by 700 people in the last five years of its administration. That is where the slashing occurred&mdash;under Labor. The figures in relation to the Australian Federal Police were outlined by the Attorney&hyphen;General during question time today. Labor members have stood in this place today crying crocodile tears and complaining about the number of staff in these organisations, while they were the ones who presided over significant reductions in staffing numbers.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;How often do we hear people say that the future of Australia is its youth? Who can forget that during the election campaign those opposite touted family values as one of the central planks of their policies? But, when you look at the results, you have to ask what the government has done for youth or family values. There is no protection for young people from the scourge of drugs. It was claimed today that it is cheaper to buy a hit of heroin than it is to buy a packet of cigarettes. In Australia we are wide open to drugs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I noted what the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs (Mr Truss) said about there being a bipartisan approach. We are looking forward to what will be said on Sunday. We want to have a bipartisan approach, but we have got to recognise that there is a problem. Hurling abuse and saying, `You people did nothing,' will not achieve a bipartisan approach. I think everyone in the chamber wants a bipartisan approach, but stop closing your eyes to the fact that there is a very serious problem out there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Representing, as I do, Port Kembla, I am well aware of the drug problems. I see what goes on on the streets of Port Kembla. People come and talk to me. I am on the board of the mission for the seamen. I talk to people in Port Kembla. I know what is happening there. I know that heroin is sold very cheaply for as little as $5 or $6 a hit. Drug pushers sell the first hit to the young very cheaply. They leave the kids dry for a while and then they hit the kids again for an increased cost. When heroin is not about at Port Kembla the crime rate goes up and immediately everyone is restless. When the heroin is brought in the crime rate goes down. That is going on in Port Kembla 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10356"> and you cannot say that it is not. It is a vicious circle. Heroin has become a cheap and readily available drug and the young kids are buying and using it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How dare the minister say that we have not raised that issue! You have only to look back through <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> to see the number of times that the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) and I have raised in this House the question of the customs services at Port Kembla. In fact, I have written to all the Customs ministers&mdash;I have not written to the new minister, but he will receive a letter from me&mdash;inviting them to come to Port Kembla, talk to the customs people and see what is happening there. Unfortunately, they cannot talk to the Federal Police because they have been taken away from Port Kembla.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the member for Cunningham has pointed out, in its mad drive for the bottom line in the last two budgets the government has cut back funding to vital services which are supposed to be Australia's defence line against drugs and the people who push them into our community and to our youth. These budget cuts most savagely hit regional Australia and the specific law enforcement agencies tasked to fight the war on drugs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do not be misled into thinking that drugs only come in through the major airports and ports of Australia, the so&hyphen;called front doors; they also come in on isolated fishing vessels. Boats go up the north coast of New South Wales&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, you have heard the stories as I have heard the stories from my family there&mdash;things are thrown over and other boats come out and pick them up. But the main places where drugs come in are the regional ports close to our major cities. Port Kembla is a wide&hyphen;open drug centre on the east coast of Australia. It is no exaggeration to say that Port Kembla is the major heroin importing port on the east coast. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Drug runners have a free hand in the area. They do as they please, sell what they like and flout the local police and law enforcement agencies because there are not enough people there to stop them. It is a tragedy and an enormous disgrace. Port Kembla has over 500 ship visits a year, but the Customs Ser 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> vice at Port Kembla has in theory only five officers. There are usually only three officers at Port Kembla because people are off sick or on holiday. Two years ago there were 16 officers at Port Kembla. Today there effectively are three officers at Port Kembla. They operate from 9 to 5. They are fighting a war with one hand tied behind their back: as if all the importation there is between 9 and 5!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A few months ago I received a letter from the local pastor at Port Kembla. The pastor outlined in his letter what everyone in Port Kembla has known for some time. I forwarded this letter to the then newly appointed Minister for Customs, and Consumer Affairs, Senator Ellison, for response. The minister responded in due course and said, interestingly, that a top priority for the Australian Customs Service `is the interdiction of imports of illicit drugs'. We all agree on that point. The minister also told me that `a large proportion of these funds will be spent on acquiring and installing closed&hyphen;circuit television cameras for monitoring Australian ports, including Port Kembla'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just this morning I was informed that the closed&hyphen;circuit television camera that was installed at the grain berth at Port Kembla had been packed up and shipped back to Sydney because of technical problems. It may interest the then minister to know that Port Kembla has no closed&hyphen;circuit television to, as he said in his letter to me, `significantly improve after&hyphen;hours surveillance of wharves and vessels'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The closed circuit television that has just been packed off because of technical problems was hardly worth boasting about. I was taken on a tour of the port, as I am from time to time, earlier this year. I was taken to the places where these closed&hyphen;circuit televisions and cameras are placed. They are so well placed that everyone knows where they are. They are so well placed that, instead of focusing on a vessel or some activity at the berth, the majority of the images were overshadowed by fixtures belonging to the structure of buildings and other things. If it was not so serious it would be quite funny.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further down the south coast is Eden, which is developing into another significant 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10357"> regional port. Log boats use the port extensively for woodchip exports and there is even a proposal to construct a new berth there. Drugs are coming through Eden as they are coming through Port Kembla.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has to be understood is that Port Kembla is one hour and 30 minutes from the major distribution centres of Sydney. Heroin can come off a ship at Port Kembla and be on the streets being sold within an hour and a half. The response of the government has been to establish a flying squad in Sydney which comes to Port Kembla for major drug runs. The drug runners can get their supply of heroin and be passing the flying squad on the F6 freeway coming in the other direction. With this well researched intelligence that everyone has got, they are in the cars going up the M6 to Cabramatta or to Sydney while the flying squad is coming down to intercept them on the boats or somewhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have raised the issue of drug importation at Port Kembla with successive ministers. I have asked these ministers to visit Port Kembla with me to talk to the locals and see for themselves just how open Port Kembla really is. A former minister, in an answer to a question from the member for Cunningham, made the point that Port Hedland had a larger shipping movement than Port Kembla and they had electronic surveillance there which was very successful. So be it. How can anyone compare a port thousands of kilometres from a city with a port facility within a regional centre that is only an hour and a half from Sydney? It is just beyond me. In too many respects, the drug trade in Australia is out of control. I only wish that those who had become so vocal and outspoken about paedophilia and other anti-social behaviour were equally outspoken and vocal about the importation of hard drugs and the way they are destroying young Australian lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cost cutting measures introduced in the last two budgets are short&hyphen;sighted and penny&hyphen;pinching at its most manic. The drug trade is worth millions&mdash;in fact, more than millions, billions of dollars. The drug runners are well organised, well financed and well equipped. We are definitely not talking about a bunch of amateurs. And the trade is increasing. You 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> know it is increasing. It is not what people say publicly in the papers. Go and talk to the Federal Police. Go and talk to the customs people. Go and talk to anyone. It is a well organised business, and it is increasing in frightening proportions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet what do we put up against this organised crime? An underfunded, under&hyphen;researched group of law enforcement agencies. Do not come with this rubbish about what the Labor Party did. What they have got to do is realise we have a problem and approach it. This is in no way to be critical of the Australian Federal Police, the NCA or the customs officers. Under the circumstances, they do a magnificent job with the limited resources they have been provided with by this government&mdash;and I might say by previous governments. We have got to start funding them if we are going to be serious about it. Until we properly resource these agencies, we are only scratching the surface&mdash;making no impact on the drug trade, losing the battle and wasting young lives because of the penny-pinching and ultimately short&hyphen;sighted stupidity of the government with regard to these fundamental services for Australia.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier this year I spent a couple of nights on the streets of Kings Cross talking to young people who were involved with drugs. I met one young fellow and he told me that heroin had saved his life. As a child he had lived with his mother who had broken up with his father when he was very young. Early in his life his mother had remarried. His step&hyphen;father had abused him right throughout his life. He had exceptionally low self-esteem and by age 13 he had left home and was on the streets. He was not educated. He had not done terribly well at school and, at age 16, contemplating suicide, he tried heroin for the first time. Suddenly, for the first time in his life, he had esteem&mdash;he felt good about himself. And he was hooked. Aged 19, for various break and enter and drug related crimes, he was sent to prison for four years. I met him three days after his release at a food cart in Kings Cross. He was exceptionally angry because, four years later, all of his friends were gone, he had no family connections and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10358"> he had been released with the clothes he had been arrested in and a small amount of money. After 13 years of Labor in government, there was no program there to pick him up when he was released.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I met another young woman who had a mental illness. She was an addict, but there was very little that the government programs at that time could do for her because she did not fit in with the programs to deal with mental illness because she was a drug addict. But she did not fit into the programs designed for drug rehabilitation because she had a mental illness, so she was wandering in limbo. I met another young woman who had married an Australian when she was in South America. She did not speak any English. She had come to Australia with him. He had abused her and she found herself on the streets not speaking English in Australia. When looking at prostitution as a means to get by, heroin seems a pretty good option.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is about alternative programs. It is not simply catching the drugs when quite significantly and right throughout the world at this time every nation is losing the battle against the importation of the physical substances. It is about caring for the individuals who are affected. It is about offering them something more, a better life and less despair than the circumstances in which they find themselves when they first try heroin, cocaine, ecstasy or even marijuana. It is a problem of enormous complexity and no nation has solved it. After 13 years in government, Labor had not solved it either. It is very disappointing to find them trying to score cheap political points on this issue at this time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Federal Police have indicated quite clearly to the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) that no operation, no sting, no task force that they had out there on the streets was compromised by any budget cuts. It was done administratively. They offered up the five per cent saving that every other government department offered up, in order to get our fiscal policy back in the black, in order to overcome that unemployment amongst our youth, the tragic levels of unemployment of our youth left to us by Labor. That unemployability was brought about through low 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> literacy levels, through broken families, through financial stress on relationships that left kids in dire circumstances with low self-esteem and low skills. Labor left us with $10 billion worth of debt to deal with those problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The mandate with which we were elected is clear evidence that the previous government had failed in addressing social issues and the reasons that people actually turn to drugs. It is not a simple problem. It is not something as simple as saying, `Oh well, let us increase the number of men on the beat and we will get all of the cocaine and all of the substances that are out there.' It has not happened in Australia's history. It has not happened in America's history. It has not happened in Scandinavia's history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a cheap stunt by the opposition if they think that they can drive the demand for these substances underground. It is a matter of addressing the real issues behind that demand. The extra money that has been put into this area has been put into technological surveillance. When I first came to this parliament on 2 March 1996, I had a 486 computer and a hot&hyphen;paper fax. That is the state of technology that the Labor government left the government services with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is known that it is not the cocaine you need to get. It is the money trail. It is the money laundering. When you track down the money that is where you get the operators. Today, to chase that paper trail you need technological capability such as satellite communications, interception devices and encryption devices. From a defence point of view, the government's encryption devices were left in a decrepit state by Labor. We really need to look at all of these resources to ensure that our activities against the drug lords are secure&mdash;to ensure that we can break any codes that they are using and we can trace any banking transactions and any money laundering that is going on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You can see from Tuesday's paper that we have unmasked two of the major dealers in this area who were basically using casinos and various other mechanisms to launder money. We have had them banned from casinos. We are tracking them through the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10359"> banks. If you cannot do that nine to five, when else can you do it? It is a matter of tracking those international banking connections. It takes technology to do that. It is something that Labor ignored, they had no zest for and they had no understanding of. They left the Australian Federal Police technologically in the dark ages against an organised Asian crime syndicate that is well funded, well resourced and high&hyphen;tech.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are also investigating individuals on the east coast who are involved in organised crime and illicit motorcycle gangs&mdash;which I think reflects poorly on a number of motorcycle groups in my area. We hold an annual get&hyphen;together in Penrith. Police are very aware of those activities through surveillance. We are closing down the ways they have available to them to launder money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After taking the action this government has, we then turn to addressing the despair of the users. Why do they use for the first time? We have introduced literacy programs&mdash;we are fixing that problem&mdash;JPET, youth homelessness pilot programs, family counselling, family tax initiatives and savings initiatives to take the financial pressure off families. Financial pressure really busts families up. We have family counselling to resolve crises before they get to the Family Court. There is no point, once summonses are issued, to offer them family counselling. We are setting up systems to keep families together earlier. We have built strongly on our budget figures. Our underlying deficit has been reduced dramatically. In the last four years we have been running at least $10 billion in deficit. In the last four years of Labor they sunk Australia nearly $60 billion into the hole and we have to pay that back. That amount of money carries with it interest as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By 1999, we will be back in the black. There will be confidence in the Australian economy, there will be jobs growth and there will be a future for young people. They will recognise and have confidence in that. They will have jobs. They will have skills. They will have literacy. They will have a community awareness that will carry them straight through into the next millennium. This government has done an exceptional job of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> addressing the underlying causes of drug use. It is disappointing to see the political point scoring on this issue. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am actually a bit loathe to rise to speak in this debate since the Minister for Finance and Administration (Mr Fahey) is now in the chamber. It is interesting that when the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) answered a question on this issue in question time today he talked about the lack of bipartisanship in this field. In fact that is not quite true. There has been bipartisanship. Over recent years, the government and the opposition, whichever was in power at the time, have actually cut back in federal law enforcement agencies. When one looks at the cuts that have been inflicted upon the AFP in recent years, it is important to note that now the AFP has operational staff levels that it has not had since 1984. It has had a very serious decline in the operational staff capability in its fight against drugs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have proposed in this place and elsewhere that we ought to have a $100 million war against drugs. This is one of those areas where you have to balance up the fiscal responsibility of a fiscally responsible government and the social costs of the insidious threat of drug trafficking. I am not going to rely on the sorts of things that we pick up around our electorates. I am going to quote some of the experts. It is interesting that the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs (Mr Truss), who is no longer in the chamber, was a member of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Crime Authority during the time we were receiving evidence from experts around the country, both from the state and federal law enforcement agencies, who were reflecting the views of the AFP Association and others that the cutbacks have had a debilitating effect in the fight against crime and drugs, in particular. Jane E. Becker, a Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The problem is getting bigger internationally. Worldwide opium production has more than doubled in a decade. The increase is disproportionately larger in South&hyphen;East Asia. The CIA's latest estimates show that South&hyphen;East Asia's 1994&hyphen;95 crop was one of the largest in years. Cultivation was up 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10360"> five per cent and production, thanks to ideal weather, was up 20 per cent to 2,545 metric tonnes&mdash;64 per cent of worldwide production. More countries meanwhile are becoming increasingly involved in heroin production and trafficking.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That quote gives one of the reasons why we have a much more pronounced problem with heroin trafficking in Australia: the availability of supply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not often support the New South Wales Premier, but I must say that he is not alone in criticising the federal government's cutbacks. I think it is cheap political point scoring for the federal government to single him out as the only voice of criticism in the area of drug trafficking, because he is not alone. The Premier of Western Australia, Richard Court, a Liberal Premier, his Minister for Police and Emergency Services and his commissioner of police have said that they believe there is a crisis in drug trafficking in Australia. The Victorian police minister, another Liberal minister, and his Chief Commissioner of Police, Mr Comrie, have both said that there is a crisis requiring crisis response, not just another round of rhetoric. The commissioners of the South Australian and Queensland police services have also said that there is a very serious crisis. They have all indicated&mdash;certainly in the evidence we received in the public hearings of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, a committee of which the minister for customs was formerly a member, and a member during the relevant period&mdash;that the federal cutbacks have had a debilitating effect on the fight against drugs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister said that the drug problem is not a new phenomenon. Of course it is not. It goes back many years. There is no doubt, and the experts all agree, that the problem has accelerated in recent years. In particular, in the last three years it has got to the extent where the purity and availability of heroin now is unprecedented. It is unprecedented to the extent that it has caused so many overdoses from people who are unable to cope with the increased purity of the heroin supply on the streets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me ask this question: is the federal government serious about the drug trafficking problem or does it just see it as another second order problem when it is considering 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> financial cutbacks as part of its general fiscal disciplined approach? When I said at the beginning that there is a balance between the fiscal discipline required of a responsible government and the requirement to ensure these types of social problems do not get out of hand, then quite clearly in this case the drug problem&mdash;in particular the heroin problem&mdash;is a matter that requires crisis responses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister for customs talks about the changes to customs technology and intelligence. My information is, when we are talking about closed&hyphen;circuit television improvements, that in many instances those closed&hyphen;circuit television monitors are not monitored by staff. So, if a courier or somebody who is a suspect comes through, then those tapes have to be reviewed before anything can be done about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing is that the backscatter X&hyphen;ray detection equipment, which has been promoted as one of the most advanced technological weapons in the fight against drug trafficking, is principally used for material going outwards. It is for the detection of illegal currency transactions. When they say that it is another part of the armoury in the fight against drugs, they are not being fair dinkum. When they talk about the intelligence effort, they are not fair dinkum either because my information is that, with drug busts of more than $10,000, no drug bust has been initiated by the customs service based purely on customs intelligence; it has often come from other arrangements or other services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me talk about other areas where we have to ask whether the federal government is really fair dinkum about the fight against drugs. Another area relates to mutual assistance in criminal matters&mdash;legislation which was passed last year. In effect, this legislation makes it more difficult for Australia to participate in intelligence circulation and exchange with criminal intelligence agencies in our region. In 1994 I went to a conference in Sydney on Asian organised crime&mdash;and in particular on drugs&mdash;organised by the AFP and NCA. At that conference it was said that one of the biggest concerns was the Australian government's approach in areas where particular nations have capital penalties 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10361"> attached to offences when a person has been arrested. The mutual assistance in criminal matters legislation prohibits the Attorney&hyphen;General from providing information&mdash;even when the person arrested is not an Australian citizen&mdash;when Australia can provide information that may lead to a conviction. I might tell you that the Asian nations in our region colloquially call Australia a `NATO' country&mdash;no action, talk only.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can tell you that when the secretary&hyphen;general of Interpol was here he agreed with the proposition that any impediment to the free and efficient circulation and exchange of information in these matters will impede drug detection. Although it is not a drug matter, if there was another Oklahoma bombing, for instance, and Australia had information that could lead to the detection and conviction of a person who could be arrested and charged with that, the Attorney&hyphen;General would be prevented by that legislation from exchanging that information unless the United States government came up with an assurance that they would not carry out the penalty, and that would be very unlikely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently, the government participated in the Thai baht bailout, a matter not debated in this place&mdash;nor was there any statement by the government. I ask why there was no requirement placed on the government of Thailand in relation to our $1.4 billion currency swap to improve and crack down on the drug trafficking coming from the Golden Triangle, of which Thailand is a part. In the end, how would we know? How could the population know? In actual fact, the matter was not made available for debate, even by the representatives of the public in this particular place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A principal senior adviser to this government is Daryl Smeaton. He is head of the Commonwealth Law Enforcement Board. He was responsible for the Commonwealth law enforcement arrangements review in 1994, when they clearly identified who was responsible for much of the heroin importation into Australia. That was identified in 1994, and now the situation is much worse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we can ask this question&mdash;irrespective of party background: is this government really serious about the fight against organised 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> crime? We can ask the question: what has been done since 1994 except to cut back Commonwealth law enforcement arrangements? Mr Smeaton told us in May 1997:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That has been quite clear&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">when responding to government cutbacks impeding the fight against crime&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">in the public statements of the chair of the National Crime Authority, and the Attorney&hyphen;General himself has said publicly that resource reductions do not help in the fight.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would say that that clearly contradicts the argument in place by the minister when he was participating in this particular debate. Anyway, the Victorian police told us that children as young as 14 are selling heroin at $7 a taste on Little Bourke Street in Melbourne and they can do virtually little or nothing about that. That in my view is a national tragedy. It is a crisis. It quite clearly requires an extraordinary effort. I can only call on the government to change its mind and do something about it once and for all. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">The government agreed in the 1997-98 budget to the construction of purpose&hyphen;built accommodation for the archive at its Acton headquarters and refurbishment of the archive's existing headquarters building.

Current use of the buildings does not satisfy occupational health and safety building standards and is at odds with the heritage aspects of the building and site. The new building is required to provide safe, secure and suitable facilities and accommodation for the NFSA, and the consequential refurbishment of the existing building is necessary for the same reasons, as well as to improve access to its collections. This proposal will include construction of a new two&hyphen;storey building to house the NFSA's administrative and technical functions; refurbishment of the existing headquarters, including public galleries, to house the public functions of the NFSA; refurbishment of the existing residence building to house corporate affairs staff; demolition of the existing demountable buildings, metal clad storage structures and nitrate vaults; redevelopment of the character of the site and buildings within a landscape setting; and retention of the existing permanent car park with minor modifications. Additional on&hyphen;site parking will be provided for approximately 25 cars and five tourist coaches.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The out&hyphen;turn cost of the proposal is estimated to be $14.85 million. The project will be funded through instalment purchase payments of approximately $2.3 million per annum for a period of up to 15 years. It is anticipated that construction will commence in November 1997 and be completed in mid to late 1999. The Public Works Committee in its report tabled on 21 October 1997 concluded that there is a need for the project.

<PARA STYLE="Para">The coalition's 1996 election policy statement `For art's sake&mdash;a fair go!' stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a matter of national embarrassment that Australia remains the only nation which does not have a fully fledged national museum.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">These works will address that matter. The National Museum of Australia was established with bipartisan political support by the National Museum of Australia Act 1980 to research Australian history, establish a gallery of Aboriginal Australia, develop a national collection of historical material and create exhibitions and public programs which  explore our heritage and history. Without a building the museum has been constrained in its operations as a national institution and as a showcase for the nation's cultural heritage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The museum will break new ground among the nation's museums and educational institutions by combining the best contemporary exhibition techniques with new media technologies. A digital theatre is planned as the centrepiece of the museum, featuring the Asia&hyphen;Pacific's largest high definition video screen. Incorporated within the facility will be a sophisticated media and communications centre so that the museum can become a communications hub, exchanging media programming and data with schools, museums and other institutions around the continent and the world. The museum will total a net area of 16,160 square metres, including allowances for orientation space, commercial and public use areas, public programs, outdoor programs,

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies was founded in 1964. It is the largest research centre of its kind for information about the cultures and lifestyles of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. The institute's leased premises are makeshift and inadequate. It has an urgent need for environmentally controlled storage for the preservation of its collections of photographs, audiovisual material, books, journals and manuscripts. The institute will total a net area of 4,305 square metres including allowances for orientation space, the institute's library and digital production team, the Aboriginal studies press, research facilities and executive, finance and corporate services. Co&hyphen;location of the museum and the institute has always been intended and will benefit both organisations through shared access to collections and research data. Many visitors will visit both.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1997-98 budget confirmed the government's commitment to the project by allocating $7 million in 1997-98 for design development and approvals for future funding to be provided through the newly established Federation Fund.

The ACT government has also committed $3 million for infrastructure and is proposing to establish the ACT Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Cultural Centre on the site. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is scheduled to commence in April 1998 and the facilities are scheduled to open on 1 January 2001 as the Commonwealth's flagship for the centenary of Federation celebrations.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The purpose of this bill is to ensure that the government can effectively discharge its fundamental responsibility to prevent the entry and stay in Australia of non-citizens who have a criminal background or have criminal associations. In considering this bill, we must remember that the vast majority of non-citizens who come to Australia are in fact law&hyphen;abiding people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a world of rapidly increasing people movements, our immigration arrangements must be designed to streamline the entry and stay of all genuine visitors, students, business people and permanent residents. However, a small proportion of non-citizens seeking to enter Australia do have substantial criminal backgrounds or criminal associations. Others commit crimes while they are in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Steps to improve my department's ability to detect visa applicants with substantial criminal backgrounds or associations are being taken including consultation with law enforcement bodies overseas. For these steps to be effective, however, they must be complemented by legislative provisions to ensure that non-citizens with a criminal background or criminal associations can be refused a visa. The provisions must also enable the government to remove those non-citizens who are detained following convictions for crimes committed in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Experience over recent years has shown that the existing legislative provisions are inadequate for this task. This is despite the fact that they were amended as recently as 1992 with the express purpose of improving the government's ability to deal with visa applicants and visa holders with a substantial criminal background. In broad terms, the bill seeks to enhance the government's ability to deal with non-citizens who are not of good character in three ways:</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Firstly, decision making in routine cases will be improved by:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10364">
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">-<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> requiring applicants to show that they are of good character;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">-<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> deeming that certain levels of criminal sentences will lead to an automatic finding that the non-citizen concerned is not of good character; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">-<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> allowing the minister to give binding directions to decision makers.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Secondly, in exceptional or emergency circumstances, the minister, acting personally, will be given powers to act decisively on matters of visa refusal, cancellation and the removal of non-citizens.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Thirdly, information provided by Australian and international law enforcement agencies will be afforded more effective protection so that such agencies can be confident about passing information to immigration decision makers.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I will now describe the major provisions of the bill in more detail.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The character test</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments proposed in this bill introduce the concept of a character test. Under this test, the onus will be on visa applicants and visa holders to satisfy decision makers that they can pass the test. This will redress a significant deficiency in the legislation arising from the changes made in 1992. Since that time, decision makers have been required to establish that a person is not of good character before they could refuse a visa applicant or cancel a visa. This has meant that, whenever there has been doubt about the criminal background or criminal associations of a non-citizen, the doubt has been resolved in the non-citizen's favour. I understand that this was not the intention of the 1992 amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill then takes us back to the situation that existed before 1992 by placing the onus of proof on the visa applicant to demonstrate that he or she is of good character. This means that where there are real doubts about the criminal background or criminal associations of a visa applicant or visa holder, the objective of protecting the Australian community will take precedence in immigration decision making.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA STYLE="Para">Deeming provisions</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill also seeks to establish clear benchmarks for criminal behaviour that would automatically lead to a non-citizen failing the character test. Non-citizens who have been convicted to a single sentence of detention of 12 months or more, or where the length of several sentences aggregates to two years or more, will fail the character test. This will truncate the character assessment process and cover most non-citizens of character concern who come to notice. This will provide more certainty as to who is able to pass the character test.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Binding directions on exercise of the discretion</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once it is established that a visa applicant or visa holder does not pass the character test, decision makers will have to decide whether to refuse the application or to cancel the visa. Exercise of this discretion will need to take into account a wide range of factors including: the non-citizen's links to Australia, the nature of crimes committed and any international law obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill will enable me to give precise written directions on what weight is to be given to each of these factors. These directions must be binding on all decision makers, including merits review tribunals, to ensure a consistency of approach. The written directions will be tabled in parliament.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Protection of criminal intelligence </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Criminal intelligence and related information is critical to assessing the criminal background or associations of non-citizen visa applicants and visa holders. At present, it is difficult for my department to use such information in making character decisions because its disclosure might be threatened. Australian and international law enforcement agencies are reluctant to provide sensitive information unless they are sure that both the information and its sources can be protected. Greater protection for such material would complement broader national and international strategies to counter transnational crime and the activities of those associated with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill increases the level of protection for such information. I cannot overstate the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10365"> importance of this protection to the job of preventing the entry of foreign criminals to Australia. This was highlighted in my recent discussions with officials of international law enforcement agencies.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Merits review </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opportunity to appeal character decisions to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal will be retained. However, there is critical need to reform these arrangements in two main respects: firstly, in terms of speeding up merits review processes; and, secondly, in terms of ensuring that merits review decisions reflect community standards and expectations.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Merits review streamlining and time limits</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where a non-citizen who is already in Australia is refused a further visa or has their visa cancelled on character grounds, it is essential that merits review cannot be used to prolong stay in Australia at taxpayers' expense. The average time currently taken for such cases at merits review is around 250 days from initial notification to a final decision. Many cases take even longer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During this time, the non-citizens involved, many of whom have committed serious crimes, either will be in detention at great cost to the taxpayer or will be at liberty in the community. Quite frankly, this must stop. This bill introduces more streamlined procedures for dealing with such cases. It also introduces strict time limits for the conduct of merits review cases involving character where the non-citizen is in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Minister's power to intervene or set aside Administrative Appeals Tribunal decisions</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the past 12 months, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the AAT, has made a number of character decisions that are clearly at odds with community standards and expectations. The AAT has found a number of non-citizens who have been convicted of very serious crimes to be of good character, and has ruled that they should be granted a visa. This has alarmed the community and I might say the community, when they are aware of these decisions, hold the government and not the AAT responsible. I do not know think can go on either.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is essential that the minister, acting personally, have the power to intervene or set aside such decisions in the national interest. The minister should, however, continue to be required to table the making of any such decisions in the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Emergency cases </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From time to time, there will be emergency cases involving non-citizens who may be a significant threat to the community. These people may be threatening violence or some other act of destruction or have a prior history of serious crime. In these emergency circumstances, the minister, again acting personally, should have the power to act without notice and have them taken into detention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These people should have a subsequent opportunity to make representations to the minister to have the decision revoked. However, if they cannot satisfy the minister that they pass the character test, they should be removed immediately. Parliament should be notified of the making of such decisions but the decisions should not be subject to merits review because of their national significance.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Conclusion </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill sends a clear and unequivocal message on behalf of the Australian community. The Australian community expects that non-citizens coming to Australia should be of good character. To discharge this expectation, the government must have the ability to act quickly and decisively, wherever necessary, to remove non-citizens who are not of good character. This bill meets our election commitment to the Australian people to strengthen the character provisions of the Migration Act.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Batman referred to an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS>  dealing with criminal elements entering Australia. I have carefully read the article that I believe he was referring to, which said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Police have been warned of a flood of illegal Asian immigrants entering Australia through corrupt consulate officials, sham English&hyphen;language courses and organised crime syndicates.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What I find interesting is the linkage that he made in view of those observations with migration agents. There is nothing I can see in the article that makes any reference to linking migration agents with the entry of criminals into Australia.

I regard the allegations that the honourable member made very seriously because I do place a great deal of emphasis on character issues.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me just say that the existing scheme has had mixed results. That was the judgment of the committee. If you read page 61 of the report, you will find this quote:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">To date, the Migration Agents Registration Scheme has achieved mixed results. Critics of the Scheme suggested that it has had little if any impact on the standard and conduct of persons providing immigration advice. They cited continuing problems with poor advice and unscrupulous practice as evidence of the Scheme's failure to make any discernible difference.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The committee went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Statistics obtained by the Committee support a finding that the achievements of the Scheme relevant to its objectives have been chequered.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Moving to a statutory self-regulation scheme does not go against the recommendations of that committee. While the committee considered that self-regulation was not viable at the time of the report, it did not rule out that it may be viable in the future. I think that is the important point to note: this scheme which we are implementing will ensure that a self-regulatory scheme will be viable. It will ensure, because it is statutory, that all migration agents, in order to be able to practise, will be members of the institute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's new scheme reflects also a number of other recommendations from the report. I make the point that everyone who is to give immigration advice, other than those who have had the same form of statutory exemption in the past, has to be registered. There will be a code of conduct regulating agents behaviour. There will be additional measures to improve competency. I have to say that, in my judgment, peer pressure from the sorts of people who were sensible enough to belong to an institute which was concerned about standards is going to be far stronger in its coercion to improve standards than the regulatory scheme has proved to be.</PARA>

Certainly my dealings with the people who have been at a senior level of that organisation give me confidence in the belief that the system can work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were allegations made by members who spoke about reduction in funding to advice bodies. The honourable member for Batman was at a public forum in Melbourne where I spoke, where this issue had been raised. He heard what I had to say then, and I will repeat it now. I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The grant funding previously provided to community advice bodies under the former immigration advisory services scheme has been fully incorporated into the new immigration advice and application assistance scheme. The two previous schemes have been merged into one, and the new scheme will provide the full range of services that were previously provided. These services include: immigration advice and application assistance to asylum seekers and other disadvantaged people in the community; application assistance for asylum seekers in detention; and training for voluntary sector migration agents. These services have been put out to tender throughout Australia and the overall level of funding has been increased by two per cent.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">My expectation is, and it is being realised, that we will get better value for money through the tender process. In that sense, there has been no overall reduction at all in the level of funding available for voluntary service delivery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have made some further inquiries because it is important to be able to clarify for the House some of the changes that occurred as a result of the review that was undertaken. The planned allocation of resources between the states for immigration advice and assistance services has been altered. That reflects significantly increased numbers of residence applications in New South Wales. Between 43 and 45 per cent of all new arrivals have been going to New South Wales for a number of years now and service delivery has not reflected that circumstance.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10368"> that I am trying to get a better dispersal of the outcome. In relation to the delivery of services, we had a situation in 1996-97 where 40 per cent of the funding went to Victoria and 30 per cent of the funding went to New South Wales. That reflected the historical distribution of applications and there has been some change, which has prompted some of the organisations that have seen that change to complain. The planned allocations for 1997-98 will see 26 per cent of the funding going to Victoria and 44 per cent of the funding going to New South Wales.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make some comments on the second reading amendment moved by the opposition. In relation to the charge that the bill will open the way for unscrupulous agents to exploit the vulnerable, let me make the point that this bill retains all of the important consumer protection elements in the existing scheme. The new scheme improves the existing protection elements. Agents will be required to register and meet entry standards in order to practise. Agents will be subject to an expanded code of conduct and will be subject to sanctions if they breach that code.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Agents will have to meet new competency and professional development requirements in order to obtain further periods of registration. Previously re&hyphen;registration was automatic and there was no testing of skills. That is a significant change and a beneficial change. Agents who fail to meet these requirements will be refused registration and will not be eligible for further registration for another 12 months. Any further move to self&hyphen;regulation depends on a review of these arrangements that will be undertaken before March 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been some questions raised in the second paragraph of the opposition's second reading amendment in relation to voluntary agents not having to pay registration fees. Currently there are about 450 non-fee charging agents who work in the voluntary sector and do not pay a registration fee. They did not have to meet the same standards as fee charging agents. You cannot tolerate a two-tier system where the most vulnerable, about whom you were speaking, receive a lower standard of service. That was what was happening under the existing scheme. If you

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You make that observation. All I am saying is that the standards under the legislation were not the same and were not required to be the same. That is the fact. You can make these allegations, but that was the legal regime that you had in place. All agents will be required to be registered and will be charged a fee. All agents will be required to meet the same knowledge test. The government is providing training to assist voluntary sector agents to meet the full knowledge test and registration through the immigration advice and assistance scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only other point I would make is that there will still be a disparity in the fees. The voluntary agents will pay a fee of $450 compared with full registration fees of around $1,000.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just told you what they will be. In relation to the claim in the third paragraph of the opposition's second reading amendment that consumer rights will be marginalised and there will be no overall monitoring authority, let me make the point that the overall monitoring authority is and remains under this legislation the government. The bill gives me as the minister the power to register and sanction migration agents. It allows me to appoint an agent to undertake that work, and I intend to appoint the Migration Institute of Australia as the migration agents registration authority.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The appointment will be supported by a formal agreement between that organisation and me on how these powers are to be exercised. Its performance will be closely monitored. The appointment is able to be revoked by me if the powers are not being exercised in the interests of consumers. The act will continue to provide that decisions made about registration agents may be reviewed by the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10369"> Administrative Appeals Tribunal. So the opposition needs to recognise that this is a statutory self-regulatory scheme; it does not deregulate the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The further point I would make relates to the opposition's claim about the reduction in time for lodging of objections to proposed registration. I could go on for some time, but let me say at the moment the notification about which there is a longer time is provided in the government <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS>. I do not know how many people actually read the government <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS> to look for notifications as to who is going to be a registered migration agent, but I suspect very few consumers ever read the government <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS>.

They are railing about the need to deal with `shonks and crooks in the industry'&mdash;they were the words used in the committee stage. Yet when it comes to supporting sensible measures to enable us to take away some of the opportunities for people to exploit our law, they are quite prepared to oppose these measures in the parliament.

<PARA STYLE="Para">I am asking the House to agree to the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R265">Native Title Amendment (Tribunal Appointments) Bill 1997</XREF>  as amended by the Senate due to the pressing need to have the amendments contained in the bill passed in the legislation.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill as amended includes a provision altering the qualifications for the appointment of the registrar of the National Native Title Tribunal. The amendments remove the requirement that the registrar be admitted to legal practice for five years and replace it with a requirement that a person may not be appointed as registrar unless the person is legally qualified and has had substantial experience in relation to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander societies or the law or administration or any other class of activity considered relevant to the duties of the registrar.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the registrar will no longer have any role in deciding whether or not applications should be accepted, it is appropriate that the qualifications for appointment be changed. The proposed amendment will ensure that a more diverse field of suitably qualified candidates may be considered for the position of registrar of the tribunal. The registrar has agreed to stay on until the end of the year to allow a suitable replacement to be appointed. Therefore, as it is imperative that the bill is passed to allow a replacement appointment to be made before the end of the year, the government is accepting the bill as amended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate did not agree to a proposed amendment to the qualifications of presidential members. Currently, a presidential member has to be a Federal Court judge or a former judge of the High Court, Federal Court or state or territory Supreme Court in order to be eligible for selection. This not only severely restricts the pool from which suitable candidates can be drawn, it also means that otherwise highly qualified people, especially those experienced in the rapidly developing area of native title law, are excluded from consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed amendment sought to include a further class of persons who could be appointed as a presidential member, that is, a person who has been admitted to legal practice for at least five years. The Senate did not agree to this amendment. The constitution requires that judicial functions involving the determination of people's legal rights are exercised by the courts and not tribunals or commissions. Restricting presidential appoint 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="10374"> ments to the tribunal to Superior Court judges only means that judges are taken away from where they are most needed by the public&mdash;determining people's rights under law&mdash;and placed in a tribunal to undertake functions that differ from their judicial role.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment is essential to the changed role of the tribunal as a result of the Brandy decision. Accordingly, the government is committed to bringing back to parliament in the near future this necessary alteration to the selection requirement for the appointment of presidential members for the National Native Title Tribunal. I commend the amendment to the House.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendments 2 to 14: the amendments will change the date of effect for all charitable trusts and certain other tax&hyphen;exempt organisations to 1 July 1997. The original date of effect was generally 20 August 1996, as announced in both the 1996 and 1997 budgets and the exposure draft to the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the bill was introduced into the parliament there have been representations pointing out that a number of charitable trusts have not taken into account the budget announcement and have continued to make contributions offshore since 20 August 1996. If this date of effect stands they will permanently lose their tax&hyphen;exempt status.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These measures are, of course, aimed at tax avoidance and it would be unfortunate if any 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10375"> charitable trusts were to lose their tax exemption simply because they were not aware that they were prohibited from distributing funds directly offshore. In response to this concern, the government decided to amend the date of effect, even though it expects that $25 million in revenue will be forgone. I commend the amendments to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

The procedures followed yesterday on the Native Title Bill were unusual. Amendments were moved and then postponed so that a general debate could take place.

It was necessary for the member for Dawson to formally move her final amendments in between divisions, which she did without debate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to pay tribute to a great Australian who passed away yesterday. Dr H.C. `Nugget' Coombs has been described as a planner of dreams, an inexhaustible resource, a rebel, and the most influential public servant in Australian history. An adviser to seven prime ministers, Nugget Coombs earned the respect of men as divergent in their world views as Bob Menzies and Gough Whitlam.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nugget Coombs was a dedicated and passionate man who shared his wisdom without fear or favour. Nugget Coombs was an accomplished, hands-on economist who believed the economy should serve the people&mdash;and not the reverse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs it is fitting that I say a few words about Nugget Coombs' contribution to the advancement of indigenous Australians. Nugget Coombs was appointed to chair the Council for Aboriginal Affairs in 1968. From that moment, his life and work became more and more involved in the struggle to help indigenous Australians take control of their lives and make their own way in the nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So respected was he by indigenous Australians that he was the only whitefella invited to attend the crucial Eva Valley meeting in 1993, where an indigenous position on proposed native title legislation was hammered out. Nugget was a fearless advocate of what he called `Aboriginal autonomy'. He argued strongly that indigenous people should be empowered to take control of their own lives on their own terms. He was convinced that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> native title rights are essential to achieving that goal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nugget Coombs was a hardworking man. Even in the last few years before he suffered a stroke three years ago, he was still working eight&hyphen;, 10&hyphen; and 12&hyphen;hour days&mdash;researching, writing and visiting remote Aboriginal communities, participating in the affairs of the Australian National University, or sharing his wisdom with the many politicians, businessmen, indigenous people and others who came to him for advice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He has published countless articles and essays on issues related to indigenous affairs and was recognised as one of the leading authorities in a wide range of subject areas. The books he published include: <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Other People's Money</EMPHASIS>; <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Fragile Pattern</EMPHASIS>; <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Trial Balance</EMPHASIS>&mdash;his autobiography; <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Certain Heritage</EMPHASIS>&mdash;of which he was co-author; and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Return of Scarcity</EMPHASIS>; as well as a collection of his works published in 1994 entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Aboriginal Autonomy</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nugget died on the same day the government's flawed native title legislation went through this House. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) should read another of Nugget's works. It's called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kulinma: Listening to Aboriginal Australians</EMPHASIS>. But I want to read from the preface to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Aboriginal Autonomy</EMPHASIS>. In 1994 Nugget wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Greed, contempt for future generations and willingness to exploit racial antagonism in order to resist change have become, with honourable but few exceptions, the mark of the policies of those who desire to control the world's resources.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mick Dodson, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, said of Nugget Coombs:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That old man must be respected. He is the white fellas most senior elder.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think the last word should go to Nugget himself. Asked by Michael Gordon of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  newspaper how he would like to be remembered, Nugget Coombs said simply, `He was a good bloke.'

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Rod Tyney, the Principal of Para Hills Primary School, invited me to join the school to participate in their family fun day on Sunday, 26 October.

However, there is one particular special volunteer whom I would like to pay tribute to this evening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My special tribute is for Mr Brian Houlson, a member of the Newland Central Branch within the Makin Federal Electoral Committee. Brian Houlson passed away last night and it was late this morning that I received this very sad and tragic news. The news has been particularly devastating as Brian was still of a young age and a very active and enthusiastic supporter of all of our Liberal activities, within both the electorates of Newland and Makin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was a devoted member along with his wife, Mrs Christine Houlson, and family members who survive him, especially supporting the member for Newland, the Hon.

I am sure I speak for all members of our FEC and Newland SEC when I say he was very much loved and respected by everyone. Brian's love of aeroplanes was well&hyphen;known and he devoted many years of voluntary work to the Aviation Museum in Port Adelaide, South Australia, which I have visited at his invitation on many occasions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As all of us in this place know, without the support of our branch members and their

I say that because, truly, words almost limit your ability to describe this man and his influence, his ideas and his radical conscience which has so formed this nation postwar. Flip through the papers this morning and the superlatives fly. Newspaper commentators, friends and colleagues have all struggled this morning to fully encapsulate all that Nugget Coombs has done for this great nation. I do not think any one of them has been able by themselves to completely tell everything about Nugget Coombs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nugget passed away on a day when this chamber was in the middle of a heated debate about native title. Native title and the land rights struggle by indigenous Australians was one of the many issues that Nugget Coombs 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10378"> was concerned and passionate about. Native title and the land rights struggle was one of the many issues issue that Nugget Coombs played a central role in. He played a central role in improving the conditions of Aborigines and in so doing once more strengthening the fabric of Australian society and its fair go ethos.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Right into old age Nugget Coombs was campaigning for the rights of indigenous people. I tell you what, he gave curry to our side of politics if he thought we deserved it on this issue. He wrote to former Prime Minister Keating in 1993 when he thought we were going wrong on our Mabo legislation and when he thought we needed stiffening up. I think, though, that he would approve of our stance on the current native title legislation, which is now the centre of debate in the House and the Senate. In the letter to Paul Keating back in 1993 he and his co&hyphen;writers wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no valid reason why native title cannot co-exist with pastoral leases in most cases.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Dr Coombs letter, which was also signed by Professor David Lea and Mr Greg Crouch, warned the government of the day of the international shame Australia would suffer if it squibbed the issue of native title. In the letter to the then Prime Minister dated 10 September 1993, he warned that any uncertainty being created:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . has largely been because many companies are not prepared to take the time and effort to negotiate appropriate agreements with Aboriginal land owners.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The letter went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If there is uncertainty as to whether native title exists in relation to a particular piece of land, there is no reason why the company proposing to develop that land, or exploit the resources of the land, could not negotiate with those claiming to have native title.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In 1993 Dr Coombs was providing sage advice and acting as a conscience to the Labor government. Labor listened to this famous public servant, who had provided good advice to both sides of the political fence in some 50 years of public activity. Today this advice could be just as aptly given to the current Prime Minister, and I hope he listens. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prime Minister Howard correctly praised Dr Coombs earlier today. Maybe as a sign of respect, and a symbol of Dr Coombs' greatness, Mr Howard would listen just once more to this great civil servant. Maybe as a sign of gratitude to Dr Coombs in his life's work, Mr Howard will listen to those people whom Nugget Coombs spent a great deal of his time fighting for&mdash;indigenous Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, for the children of the Depression the influence of Nugget Coombs on Australian policy was exceptionally important. He had responsibility with one Ben Chifley for the postwar reconstruction of Australia. Many children of the Depression went to war without opportunity in life. It was the work of Nugget Coombs with Ben Chifley that gave those young men and women an opportunity in life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The postwar reconstruction program gave those young men and women the opportunity to undertake some training, to develop a real career prospect in life, and to purchase, through the housing schemes that were available to servicemen, a home and create opportunities for their children. I am pleased to say that my father, who left school at the age of 13, a child of the Depression, was one who clearly benefited, and so did his five children, from the opportunities that Ben Chifley and one Nugget Coombs created for this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I give credit to Nugget Coombs not only from the Australian Labor Party this evening but also from the Ferguson family.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to talk about a group of people in my electorate who are very much looking forward to the announcement of Natural Heritage Trust funding because, in my electorate and so many others around Australia, there are numerous activities which need to be undertaken to secure the environment. Everybody knows the importance of areas such as the Great Barrier Reef and Kakadu National Park. Local creeks, waterways and rivers do not get international headlines, but they are equally important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10379">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the first instance I would like to make a few comments about a particular waterway called Lagoon Creek. There is a very dedicated group of people who call themselves the Friends of Lagoon Creek. Lagoon Creek is a particularly pretty waterway which runs through Caboolture in the middle of my electorate. At one stage it was the entire water source for the town. It was also the place of entertainment. Today, it is chock&hyphen;a&hyphen;block full of algae weeds from run-off from farms, industry and the burgeoning spread of housing. It also has the pitiful sight of rusted car bodies, household rubbish and, of course, the trolley from the local supermarket which tends to find its way down there all too often.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This group of people are trying to recover this land and achieve its restitution so that it can be here for generations to come. They, along with members of the Pumicestone water and ecosystem monitoring system and the Pumicestone Regional Catchment Coordination Association are working towards ensuring that the wonderful catchment area of the Pumicestone Passage, taking in Bribie Island, all the way from Caloundra through Caboolture to Deception Bay&mdash;one of the most pristine area of Australia&mdash;is not only maintained in its current condition but also improved and returned to the standard that it was many years ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not only the human habitation of that area but also the marine habitation, the wildlife and the bird life which have deteriorated as a result of the pollution in this area. It still looks fabulous to the eye, but the reality is that it is degenerating. This is the unfortunate spin&hyphen;off from growth in the area, and there has been a deterioration in the water quality and the condition of the local waterways for some time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recognising the need to preserve our local waterways, the  Pumicestone Regional Catchment Association and the Maroochy/Mooloolah Catchment Care Association have applied for over $200,000 in Natural Heritage Trust funding for two projects, which will include a major data collecting study for the implementation of a regional catchment strategy. It is important that we as a community have a heightened awareness of our natural environ 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment and preserve it for future generations, and these people are doing just that throughout the electorate of Longman.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst I believe the recent development in the local area has been welcomed, I call on the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) to fund these studies so that we can stop the rate of deterioration of our local waterways. They are every bit as important to these local residents as the major environmental issues of the day right throughout the nation. I would also like to pay tribute to the work of all those people associated with both groups and recognise the role Caboolture councillor Chris Minetti has played in preparing the funding application.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I donated a Waterwise kit last week to schools participating in an understanding of our catchment area so that the young people coming through, who will be responsible in generations to come for development, will be aware of the importance of waterways, no matter how small they may be. I was pleased that my wife, representing me last week, was able to make a presentation of a water kit to the Bribie Island State Primary School for their efforts and so that they can test the quality of water in our region. It is very important that we do this, that we have an awareness from the youth right through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a community activity which must be supported. This is a community activity which will improve the quality of life for all of those who live in the Longman electorate, whether they live in Deception Bay, Bribie Island, Ningi, Beachmere or in the more rural areas such as Caboolture and Woodford. These people deserve a good quality of life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important that the Natural Heritage Trust, which this government has had the foresight to put together with the sale of one-third of Telstra, be used not only for major projects but also for these important minor projects as well. I am sure this government will recognise the work of these people in their community to improve the lifestyle and the environment and, in doing so, will ensure that the Natural Heritage Trust leaves a lasting legacy not only for this generation but also for many generations of Australians to come. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In recent weeks the House and the Newcastle media have seen the increasingly embarrassing and fatuous performance by the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin) which reached a crescendo both this week and last evening with the fiasco over chicken meat. One of the things that has been put about, and I think it must be laid to rest very promptly, is this suggestion that, in the time he has been a parliamentarian, he has made wonderful achievements for the area and that somehow this government is supportive of Newcastle and the Hunter. In putting that forward, he has been questioning and quite deceitfully projecting the performance of the previous Labor government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to mention a few things that were achieved in Newcastle and the Hunter under the previous federal Labor government. I might start with the steel plan in the 1980s which contributed the equivalent of $60 million from the Commonwealth into that region's economy at its discretion. It was not chosen by Canberra, it was not chosen by the parliamentary secretary; it was chosen by local people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Paterson might consider when he next goes game fishing, as apparently he does, that the wharf at Nelson Bay, in an area that was held by the National Party, was built and funded totally by the federal Labor government. Our concern was to try to generate employment in that region. That $4 million in 1985 dollars on that one project is probably three or four times as much as the total government spending in his term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But to go further, what about the 1,200 jobs that were generated, 800 in the Taxation Office alone? We have seen 400 of those go in the last year and a half; 400 jobs on the Commonwealth Public Service payroll have been ripped out of our region. Work out the cost of that per year to the local economy and it is quite substantial. If you also look at the downstream spending, you will see that the impact of those jobs alone runs into many tens of millions of dollars, which in turn has cost us more jobs.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will give a few other examples. The railway station at Newcastle University was fully funded by the Commonwealth Labor government. The ferries on Newcastle harbour were funded by the federal Labor government. The $70 million for the building better cities program was provided by the federal Labor government. The $1 billion minehunter project, which the current government seems to be trying to claim as its project, was established and put there by the federal Labor government. The British Aerospace project for the Hawk lead&hyphen;in fighter aircraft was put in place well before this government came into office, and the downstream industries that are being built from that, as was the handover of the Williamtown airport together with $2&frac34; million in cash for the local councils to actually upgrade it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are just a few examples. You can add anything you like: the Centre for Industrial Control Science, the Industry Development Centre, the Cooperative Coal Research Centre and the first ever special program for indigenous medical students. The first ever indigenous doctors to graduate in an Australian university were as a result of a special program funded by the Newcastle University. Perhaps you can top it off by looking at the Newcastle foreshores, one of the very few national bicentennial projects outside a capital city.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is just a very small sample of the range and depth of our commitment. If the member for Paterson wants to start matching this, he has a long way to go. He has been here a year and a half already, and I reckon he is probably at one or two per cent of what we did in the 13 years we were there.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the current World President of Rotary International, Glen Kinross&mdash;incidentally only the fourth Australian to hold that lofty title&mdash;took as the theme for his year in office `Show Rotary cares', a number of clubs took up that challenge across Australia. He was in Parliament House only a week ago talking about polio and his ambitions for that as well. Tonight I wanted to talk about this challenge taken up by the Rotary clubs. Not least amongst those who took up the challenge was the Rotary Club of Canberra City, which devised a genuine but practical program of caring for young unemployed people called `young Australians want to work'&mdash;the name says it all. The name is simple enough but it graphically describes the deeply held yearning of the vast majority of young unemployed people who, given a chance, would like to work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Under the direction of the Past District Governor of Canberra City Rotary Club, Len Goodman, a carefully crafted but highly professional program was devised. It was launched by Dr David Kemp, the then Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, as recently as 3 September this year. The program was packaged in kit form and sent to 1,200 Rotary clubs around Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The kit consisted of a 14-minute video produced by the ABC; guidelines for employment focused public meetings; press releases and posters; a floppy disk with a formatted running sheet, agenda, evaluation form and certificate of participation; and, as well as that, information on CES and DEETYA. In other words, instead of Rotary's normal fundraising activities, the club went to the heart of the matter, marshalling the various players, devising an effective operational program adaptable to most circumstances but, most importantly, creating the one-on-one 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> contact between young people and potential employers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In my electorate of Hinkler, the Rotary Club of Gladstone Midday took up the challenge with considerable zeal. Its president, Graham Wilson, and the project coordinator, Gary Frost, marshalled the considerable skills of Gladstone's other Rotary clubs and the services of the Gladstone CES office under its acting manager, Lauren Thomason. The Gladstone CES was totally cooperative and its employer servicing unit, including Mary Mitchell and Leonie Hills, added their skills to the project. The Gladstone media created a community awareness of the program. General manager of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gladstone Observer</EMPHASIS>, Ned Makim, and its editor, Anne Roebuck, threw their weight behind the scheme. Sue Johnson of radio 4CC, herself a Rotarian, devised a special marketing program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was my privilege to launch this program on the local scene at a function held at the Gladstone Yacht Club on 18 September. At that function we played the tape, reviewed the material, heard what Rotaract's Anthea Jensen felt about what the program could do for youth, heard the value of employing young people from Ron Hawkins of McDonald's and heard from the Queensland Chamber of Commerce on how young people can fill staff positions when shortages occur.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10382">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That night the first trainee, Colin Cronin, signed up, and his papers were ratified that evening. In the six short weeks since then, 63 young people have found employment in that program. There were 17 full-time positions, 22 part-time positions, three apprenticeships and 21 traineeships&mdash;63 jobs in six weeks is a truly remarkable result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It just shows in this matter of employment how&mdash;with inflation down, with interest rates down and with the economy ready to take off again&mdash;the communities themselves, through the service organisations working together with their media and their CES office, can start a cycle of confidence and create a new opportunity for young people.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R339">Migration Legislation Amendment (Migration Agents) Bill 1997</XREF> , the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R337">Migration Agents Registration Application Charge Bill 1997</XREF>  and the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R338">Migration Agents Registration Renewal Charge Bill 1997</XREF>  it is also my intention to move a second reading amendment which has been prepared for the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10383"> consideration of the Committee. The opposition is opposing this legislation for a range of reasons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that, five years after Labor established the first migration system to protect the vulnerable and to try to stop the shonks, the crooks and the rorters, the coalition government unfortunately is about to water down the scheme. The migration agents registration scheme was introduced in 1992 by the Labor Party, aimed at trying to protect people in the community who are vulnerable to exploitation by unscrupulous or incompetent migration agents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today, unfortunately, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) is taking the first steps to increase exploitation of the vulnerable. We would respectfully request that the minister read the front page of the latest <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS>. An article there warns about the misuse of our migration scheme by criminal elements. That is of central importance to our consideration of the legislation before the Main Committee for consideration today. In view of that article, the Australian community should understand whether the minister can assure this parliament that the steps he is now taking will not lead to further abuse by criminal elements exploiting our migration scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The migration agents registration scheme set up by the former minister, Mr Gerry Hand, under Labor, was quickly judged a success and was strengthened following the recommendation of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration, in June 1995. We believe that the government is now intending to gut the scheme. That is what it is about, gutting the scheme and basically throwing out elements which we believe were clearly intended to make the operation of the migration system in Australia a system based on integrity and, basically, one in tune with the community's needs. To throw out those aspects which made it valuable and useful to the community, to keep the shell and then to have the hide to pretend that the government has kept the scheme is far from acceptable to the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Self&hyphen;regulation is asking the stronger parts of this sector to refrain from exploiting their position. It would be nice if it worked. However, the reality on the ground is that mostly it does not work. Did this government not state only a few weeks ago that self&hyphen;regulation with  respect to the relationship between small business and big business was not a goer? It would seem that, where the government believes that there are votes out in the small business community, it is willing to oppose self&hyphen;regulation to try to buy back small business's support. But when it comes to protecting the vulnerable in the community with respect to the operation of the migration system in Australia, this is a government which supports deregulation without proper consideration of the consequences of such deregulation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Was this not because, so the government stated, there was a major power imbalance? I think the role of government is to ensure that we try to correct some of those power imbalances from time to time, not only to ensure that there is integrity in the Australian community but also to ensure that all Australians get a fair go and can operate on the basis that there is a government in place that is committed to ensuring that any imbalances in power are corrected as required from time to time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the bill before the committee for consideration today, it is proposed to delegate the regulation of migration agents to the Migration Institute of Australia. Perhaps if this body really represented the majority of migration agents, this scheme would have some chance of operation. However, the membership of the Migration Institute of Australia currently is only about 10 per cent of all migration agents.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10384">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say I take exception to endeavours by this organisation in recent weeks to actually seek to negotiate with the voluntary sector fees that they might feel are appropriate for the purposes of registration if they are to obtain the authority as embodied in the bill to operate the migration agents registration scheme in the future. If the scheme is to come into operation, I would have thought that sector ought to be totally excluded from the requirement to pay fees, yet we have these usurpers out in the community seeking to negotiate, even before the bill is properly considered by the Australian parliament, appropriate registration fees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the Migration Institute of Australia to take over an efficient scheme for the regulation of migration agents, they will need massive assistance from the department. Minister, your government's own review of the migration agents registration scheme conducted by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs in March 1997 found that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current . . . scheme has resulted in the removal from the industry of a number of grossly incompetent or unscrupulous operators who were practising as migration agents prior to its establishment.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I also contend that it has succeeded in establishing sufficient barriers to exclude those who have demonstrated a capacity for behaving unethically. Clearly, the role of government is not only about restoring the power balance but also about ensuring that the system operates on the basis of some ethics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The scheme as set up at present works to protect the vulnerable against the greedy, and I think that is exceptionally important. Many people who require assistance on the migration front clearly require special protection and a willingness by a government to actually intervene to ensure they are not exploited and, if anything, ripped off by the greedy in the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So if the system is working well, why does the government want to change it? Who is pressuring the government to get rid of regulation of the industry? After all, the government's own review also found that the scheme had not adversely affected the competitiveness of the migration advice market. There seems to be no reason to move towards self-regulation other than an ideological reason.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say from this side of the House that we are not amazed at this approach to issues judging from the government's current consideration of a range of policy issues. It is a government run by ideology, rather than the proper consideration of the impact of those ideological decisions on the Australian community at large&mdash;be it with respect to aged care, industrial relations, employment, a willingness to invest in industry policy and support regional Australia or, unfortunately, on this very sensitive issue, migration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The changes, I suggest, must be due to some crass ideological bent&mdash;to bash the public sector and contract out whatever you can get your hands on. If anything, it is to reward their mates in the Australian community. That is what it is about. You only have to look not just at this bill and the changes on a range of policy fronts in more recent times but also at the range of appointments across many committees and councils established by the Australian government&mdash;be it with respect to sporting activity, employment activity, regional Australia or whatever. It is clearly about rewarding mates. That is what it is about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also suggest that this is related to the bill currently before the House. It must be so because there is nothing, even in the review which the government bases this bill on, which indicates that self-regulation would be better or even as good as the current system. I understand why some members on the other side of the House get sensitive with respect to these issues. I refer to the fact that the review simply states:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10385">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no basis for public funding of the regulation of the migration advice industry.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The entire regulation scheme is currently paid for by registration fees. I might take issue with that but, in any event, who pays does not determine who regulates the agents. A government run regulation system funded by registration fees is perfectly feasible and legitimate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The review also stated that the industry had grown in size, developed a better reputation and had a stronger focus on standards and training. I believe that the issue of training is important. The review states baldly, with no supporting evidence or even argument, that self-regulation is needed to develop industry standards and improve client services. This interesting view immediately follows a paragraph which says that the industry has improved since the advent of the migration agents registration scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor opposition agrees that more training is needed by those who work as migration agents. The bill acknowledges this fact. But, in that context, by cutting funding to the Victorian Immigration Advice and Rights Centre and the Immigration Advice and Rights Centre, the non-profit organisations which provide the bulk of the training, the government has, in effect, cut access to such training which is so fundamentally important to the bill before the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Agents employed by the voluntary sector represent 21 per cent of all migration agents. Currently, many of these agents are registered but do not pay registration fees. It is proposed by the bill that employees of these agencies pay registration fees. As I have indicated, I object to certain elements that seek to take control of this scheme in the future, that actually seek to engage people in the marketplace to determine registration fees without proper authority or consideration by this parliament or the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Is this a deliberate strategy by the government to undermine the financial viability of the voluntary sector? It is basically about ripping away from those who really try to assist the underprivileged in the community their capacity to look after the people who really need assistance, while, at the same time, looking after their mates in the broader community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those who go to the voluntary agencies&mdash;the migrant resource centres, the IARC, the VIARC and the Refugee Advice and Case Work Service&mdash;are amongst those who are most needy in the Australian community. They are those who want to sponsor their parents, their children, their husband or their wife. If the voluntary agencies have to pay registration for their employees and volunteers, they will not be able to afford to provide this very valuable service to the Australian community and, more importantly, to those most in need in the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question, therefore, is: in whose interest is it that the poorest of the poor will either have nowhere to go or be forced to pay higher, sometimes exorbitant, fees to the private sector? That is the crux of this bill, forcing the poorest in the Australian community into the hands of the greedy and the exploiters while those who want to bring in someone to take the job of an Australian worker will be able to pay for good advice. Of course they will be able to pay for good advice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not saying that all migration agents in the private sector are greedy or unscrupulous by any means. Many of those who support self-regulation do so not because they hope thus to evade scrutiny but for reasons which they see as valid. However, we currently have a good system which provides some protection for consumers, and I would argue that we are obligated to protect it.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10386">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a responsibility on this House to seriously consider that question in this debate today. It is about ensuring that, if you have a good system which provides some protection for consumers, you must seriously consider protecting it and keeping it in place. If anything, the House should be debating how we improve it, how we strengthen it, not how we rip it apart.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us, as proposed by the bill, ensure that migration agents undertake some training each year to upgrade their skills. On the whole, migration advice cannot be controlled by market driven competition. It should be beyond market driven competition. It is not about selling apples or pears; it is about looking after people, looking after the needy in the Australian community. It is not about dollars and cents; it is about people who need assistance. Most of those who use migration agents, as I have said, basically use them on only one occasion&mdash;to apply for a family member or a spouse to come here. There really is not an opportunity to shop around. It is often at a time of desperate need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The aim of the registration scheme is to protect the Australian community against the activities of unscrupulous agents aiming to rip off the community, not just their clients. Whenever an agent helps a client lie on a form, he is rorting the system. We should not forget that fact because we all see those types of cases come across our desks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say that there is generally on both sides of the House a commitment to ensuring that those types of people are not allowed to rort the system. We also go out of our way to expose those clients and agents involved in seeking to rort and destroy a system that is basically held up in the international community as being a decent migration system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Every fake marriage, I suggest, is an abuse of our hospitality. Make no mistake, migration agents have arranged fake marriages for clients. They have in the past and they will continue to do so in the future. Every time a prostitute is brought in on a visitors visa, and then applies for permanent residence, the Australian community is rorted; it is being ripped off. Make no mistake, migration agents have arranged this for their clients. They are to be condemned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Every time a business migrant moves funds into Australia for a strictly limited period, and then moves them out again, the Australian migration system is being abused. As I have said, there are good and bad migration agents. But every time one of these migration agents absolutely rorts the Australian system, then it places further obligation on this parliament to ensure that the system in place is able to control the capacity of those rorters to undermine the integrity of the migration system in Australia. Every time a criminal from overseas comes into this country with the help of someone here, we are being exploited and our safety is being put at risk, as reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> of last weekend.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The migration agents registration scheme aims to weed out these unscrupulous, criminal agents, and so it ought. The system ought to be protected, it should be strengthened and it ought to have the support of both sides of the House. By gutting the system you are making it easier for the unscrupulous to function. That is what it is about: making it easier for the criminal elements to come into Australia, making it easier for those who want to rort the system amongst the migration agents&mdash;and it is not all of them&mdash;to actually undermine the integrity of the migration system in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not saying that the current disciplinary procedure is ideal. However, self&hyphen;regulation will not deal at all with the crooks and the rorters. And that is what some of these migration agents are, they are crooks and rorters, they are un&hyphen;Australian, and they are working against the best interests of Australia as a nation both domestically and internationally.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10387">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not object to setting up a mediation process to deal with consumer complaints. That can be done without self&hyphen;regulation, and the minister knows that as well as I do. The opposition fears that self regulation would be a backward step and may lead, in actual fact, to deregulation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, you know, and every MP in this House knows, that electorate staff have quite enough work to do without returning to the bad old days of trying to sort through misleading, wrong and illegal advice to would&hyphen;be migrants and their sponsors. More importantly, those hard cases often land on our desks after unscrupulous migration agents have ripped off ordinary people in need, charged exorbitant fees, misled them as to their capacity to assist them on a range of migration issues, and then, having ripped them off, basically said that it is the government's fault&mdash;blame the government irrespective of who was in power: `It's not our fault, you go and see your local federal member of parliament, they are to blame&mdash;not me, the migration agent; I have just taken your dollars and run, and I will continue to work one step ahead of you with money in my pocket while you and your family suffer.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those who are competent and caring agents&mdash;the majority, I suggest&mdash;have nothing to fear from the current system. The current system is for their benefit because it is about ensuring that those decent agents&mdash;as against the crooks and rorters&mdash;are out there in the Australian community with a respect and a capacity to operate in a proper way. But the community as a whole has a lot to lose from the dismantling of the safeguards put in place to weed out the shonks and crooks and rorters. That is our fear about the bill before the House today&mdash;we go down the deregulation path and it can potentially lead to the shonks, the crooks and the rorters getting the upper hand, unfortunately, with respect to the operation of a system which is basically aimed at assisting the needy in the Australian community. On that basis, as I indicated at the outset, I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you for the opportunity to speak today on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R337">Migration Agents Registration Application Charge Bill 1997</XREF> , the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R338">Migration Agents Registration Renewal Charge Bill 1997</XREF>  and the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R339">Migration Legislation Amendment (Migration Agents) Bill 1997</XREF> . This legislation is designed to further enhance the migration program and focuses on the move towards self&hyphen;regulation for the migration advice industry. Essentially, the bill is about consumer protection and ensuring that those in need of immigration assistance 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10388"> will have the confidence they need to get a service based on the minimum standard of quality, and that they will be protected. It also ensures that the service is competitively priced and that those seeking that advice will have the opportunity to get redress of a service which may be incompetent or unscrupulous.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The need for protection in this particular service industry arises because of the extraordinary vulnerability of those who seek to make use of the service. The member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) is not really concerned about the vulnerability of people. He speaks about protecting people who are unable to protect themselves and, clearly, this bill is about protecting those people. I would also like to note for the information of the member for Batman that the government is currently giving more money&mdash;some $5 million a year for the next four years&mdash;through a grant scheme to help those people most in need, particularly refugees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This vulnerability is partly due to consumers lacking skills and knowledge in this area, and this was noted in a 1995 report by the Joint Standing Committee on Migration. That report acknowledged the adverse consequences which could flow if people received inadequate or inaccurate advice&mdash;the most serious being that the applicants could lose their chance to qualify for a visa or to stay in Australia&mdash;so the federal government has long been aware that there have existed inadequacies and loopholes in the present regulatory migration advice system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is amazing to hear the member for Batman speak about migration agents in the way that he has, implying somehow that all migration agents act with impropriety. The experience that I have had in the industry is that there are good and honourable people providing good advice and high quality counsel and care for their clients. It was incredible to hear him slur the industry the way that he has today.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Also we had Mr Ian Tonkin, a Sydney barrister and consultant editor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Trade Practices Reporter</EMPHASIS> ; Cheryl Webster, a grant&hyphen;in&hyphen;aid worker for Careforce for the Anglican Home Mission; the Honourable John Hodges, whom I have mentioned: a former member of this House and very well respected on both sides, and Queensland State President of the Migration Institute of Australia, who has worked for many years in this role as a former minister in this area; and Pauline Mathieson, a national committee member of the Migration Institute of Australia. All these people worked very diligently on the report, and you could not get a more balanced group of people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In light of today's debate, it is worth while highlighting some of their key recommendations, and I would like to do that now. They reported that the migration agents registration scheme must improve its competency standards. This is what it is all about. It is about competency and doing the job right, particularly in relation to entry level training. It is important to stress that. They said that higher entry standards were needed in the restructuring of registration and the accreditation process. What is wrong with an accreditation process and having a higher standard? They reported that the registration fee scheme should reflect those particular competency skills; that legal practitioners who provide assistance should be required to register as migration agents; and that provision should also be made for an industry&hyphen;run complaints resolution service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee said that serious consideration also needed to be given to options necessary for the industry to achieve self&hyphen;regulation and to develop an industry standard. The report went on to outline the three models of regulation. The first was voluntary self&hyphen;regulation, working through mechanisms, including setting membership criteria which guaranteed that its members met set competency and ethical standards, and adopting disciplinary procedures to deal with members who breached the code. That is very important. When we look at a number of industries that are also increasing their level of competency, why does this industry have to be excluded from that? They should have a well&hyphen;developed system and a code of competency and conduct. Other mechanisms were the adoption of a complaints resolution scheme to resolve complaints between members and consumers, and the sponsorship of entry&hyphen;level courses and continuing education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second model was self&hyphen;regulation. This model would see the power to register fall within the precincts of the Migration Act under the auspices of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final model discussed was that of co&hyphen;regulation, which focused on the linkages between the government and the industry to regulate the industry. But it was concluded that the migration advice industry still needs to mature in order to achieve true self&hyphen;regulation. With this in mind, the bill reflects the government's decision to introduce a form of statutory self&hyphen;regulation for a period of two years, set to commence in March 1998.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill provides for the appointment of a Migration Institute of Australia as the migration agents registration authority, which will have statutory back&hyphen;up and departmental assistance, particularly in the area of financial accountability. The referral of instances of unregistered practice and fraud will also fall within the scope of this particular authority, and it includes provisions in relation to performance, financial accountability and also complaints handling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments geared towards monitoring the competency of agents are being spearheaded by the mandatory requirement for all persons, including lawyers, seeking to practise as migration agents to be registered. As well as the introduction of an annual registration renewal, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10390"> there will now be a requirement for proof, on application for renewal, of continuing professional development, which includes keeping abreast of the most up&hyphen;to&hyphen;date regulations, legislation and other migration requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearer and more stringent registration will also be set for agents working in the voluntary sector, and that is for agents who do not charge clients a fee. There are some very good people in the voluntary sector who provide good advice. But there are also people in the voluntary sector who need to ensure that they maintain their level of accreditation and give good advice to people&mdash;because giving bad advice can have absolutely monumental consequences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The scheme will now include assistance to be provided by persons seeking to sponsor or to monitor another person for a visa. The term `immigration assistance' will be clarified so as to not include assistance provided by travel agents or translation and interpretation service providers. All of these measures are designed to better streamline applications by persons who seek to register as migration agents&mdash;and what is wrong with that?&mdash;as well as to protect the applicants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the areas of disciplinary measures and dispute resolution, the most significant amendment is that disciplinary matters involving lawyers and agents will now be referred to the relevant professional bodies, which are the most appropriate bodies to deal with these issues. Also, the Migration Agents Registration Authority will be able to refer parties in dispute for mediation, and there will be an enhancement of the relevant offence provisions to bring them into line with the Commonwealth policy on criminal law, which is a very good measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is proposed to introduce a registration fee for those agents operating in the voluntary sector. This has been found to be necessary as at present the absence of a fee for those in the voluntary sector sometimes results in cross-subsidisation in that private sector. To offset the difficulty that those in that sector will have in meeting the costs of registration, the government is going to impose a much lower fee. Also, the Migration Institute of Australia will be authorised to collect fees on behalf of the Commonwealth as a more efficient collection measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the aim of the program being to progress towards self-regulation, there will also be measures to ease its introduction over two years. Agents working in the voluntary sector will have a reasonable time to pay any new charges and agents who are already registered as agents will have two years from the commencement date of this scheme to meet continuing professional development requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The migration advice industry, on the whole, has a very significant role to play. It is essential for the future development of an efficient and streamlined immigration program in this country that these measures be implemented to ensure that there is a competent, affordable, ethical and reputable migration advice industry. Not only is this for the protection of the industry's consumers and the community as a whole, but it is also necessary in order to complement the other wide ranging legislative and administrative initiatives that the government has already introduced into the migration program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These initiatives form a very tightly controlled package which will be monitored closely in order that the program be more efficient and be more effectively serving both migrants and the Australian people. The government should be commended for comprehensively addressing these broader issues within the program and for its continued commitment to improving the migration program.</PARA>

I support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson), the shadow minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before those opposite get too excited about some of the things I am going to say about migration agents, let me make the caveat that I know there are good and bad in every community and that not all migration agents are crooks who rip people off. I am going to speak about a couple of bad examples I know of because they are the only examples I know about. That is not surprising because many of the simple migration cases go through without ever first going to a member of parliament. We do not hear about the simple cases. It is the really difficult cases that go to migration agents. The almost impossible cases go there, and therein lies the difficulty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I enjoyed the speech of the honourable member for Petrie (Ms Gambaro). She said at the outset that this legislation was all about extra consumer confidence. I take issue with that because I do not think it is going to give the consumer any confidence at all. I think it is going to open up an area that unscrupulous operators will be able to get into and they will operate without the protection that is there now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Every member of parliament, just as they have five or six basket cases who come and see them when the full moon is out, has their five favourite stories concerning migration rip-offs. As I said before, we hear of these because it is the really difficult cases that go to migration agents. As the member representing the Illawarra and its large ethnic population, so much of my time and my office staff's time is taken up with migration cases and always they are the very, very difficult ones.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The migration agents registration scheme has been in operation since 1992. It was created in response to an alarming number of complaints from the community that unqualified and unscrupulous migration advisers were working in the field. I must put it on the public record that I have always been opposed to migration agents. It is no use saying that it was a government that I was part of which introduced it. I was opposed to the scheme even when we introduced it, and argued against it. Nothing I have seen of migration agents' operations over the years has convinced me to think less unkindly of many&mdash;not all&mdash;of these people. Yet the government is going to make migration agents subject to self&hyphen;regulation. I just cannot believe that: if any group should not be let loose on the public, migration agents are that group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My personal and long held view is that migration agents should be abolished. I think that they mislead and they build up false expectations. You only have to look at the advertisements in the weekend Sydney papers&mdash;I do not know about those in other states&mdash;to see that there are always ads such as those I have taken up with successive ministers for immigration, saying that these ads mislead. They say, in effect, `Having problems with migration? See us'&mdash;all these issues. And people do go there and see them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Migration agents can do no more, and most often do far less, than the local federal member of parliament. As the shadow minister has said&mdash;and I will illustrate this later&mdash;many of these cases that start off with migration agents end up, after the fee is paid, on our desk. It is we members of parliament who have to do the work. I have no objection to that. I think that is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10392"> one of the roles of a member of parliament, and that is why I have always been opposed to migration agents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that each of my colleagues can, and I suspect will, tell their stories about migration agents during this debate. I have had several shams operating in my area. One concerned Chinese immigrants, who would go to a lawyer who was also registered as a migration agent. This lawyer, after taking their money, would then start harassing my office about approaching the minister about a whole lot of other things. It was so blatant that the agent was pocketing the money and then wanting my office to do all the work that my office decided that we would have no dealing with that lawyer at all. Every time that lawyer would ring up or get people to ring up, we would say, `Are you dealing with So&hyphen;and&hyphen;so?' If they said yes, we would say, `He has taken on that role for you. Let him follow it through.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My office made it clear to these constituents that in future they would be required to come and see us before going to a migration agent if they expected us to take up the case. My objection was that they were paying this agent $5,000 but all they got for their $5,000 was a telephone call from the lawyer to my office, putting the case on my desk. It is just unbelievable. This is my argument with migration agents. They are in a business first and foremost; they must promise success to get people to part with their money. Yet they are fully aware that many of the cases they take on have no chance of success.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know why people are saying that migration agents give them all this advice. Many of the cases have absolutely no chance of success. We all know how difficult it is to migrate to Australia today. Over two million people apply to migrate to Australia every year, and what do we take&mdash;60,000 or 70,000 people. There are just so many cases that it is just absolutely hopeless. My policy has always been, in the 14 years I have been a member of parliament, that we will fight to the nth degree on a case. We will go and make representation and, if necessary, see the minister. We will make all the representations. But we are always very frank with everyone about migration problems or migration chances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When people come to see us, we go through the points score with them. We ask them all the usual questions&mdash;any remaining relatives there, the whole thing&mdash;and often there is absolutely no chance. Members would know the points system: if it is very close we can say,  `Okay, we will have a look at your language skills. We will have a look at your qualifications,' and we will say, `Yes, we will take your second cousin into account. You have an extended family.' We go through all these things with them. But when there are 30 or 40 points missing, even though people cry in your office and so on you have to be honest with them, because sooner or later you are going to face these people and say, `I did everything I could. I went and saw the minister three times, I did this and I did that. But there was no chance.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why build their hopes up for 12 or 18 months? It is much better to tell them first of all. We go through the points system; we do everything. We always say to people, `If you really want me to write to the minister or to go and see the minister, I will. But this will probably delay it, because they will have to get the file down from Rockdale'&mdash;or wherever they keep it in Sydney&mdash;and things like that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have always believed that if a constituent says, `You are my local member. I insist that you do this,' or, `that you write to the minister,' I should write to the minister or do whatever it is. But, in honesty, I tell them, `Yes, I will write to the minister, but I have got to tell you honestly that your chances are Buckley's. It might change later on or the policy might be different'&mdash;and I go through all of the reasons why we are only taking so few people into 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10393"> Australia. We have to tell them. I believe it is wrong and immoral to build up people's expectations falsely, knowing that there is no chance of meeting what are very stringent immigration requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Only two weeks ago, I think it was, I had a Macedonian business person come in to see me. There are a lot of Macedonian people in my electorate. This Macedonian gentleman had a 44&hyphen;year&hyphen;old female cousin here on a visitors visa. He came in to see me because, as he told me, he wanted her status changed from visitor to permanent resident. First of all, I said, `There is absolutely no chance. The best you can do is to get her to go back and then apply.' I went on with all the arguments about jumping the queue if they did it. I said, `Whatever government it is, whether it is the Labor Party or the Liberal Party, the minister will not change. They are very hard on this, for right reasons.' I said if they went back and then applied, we would watch it through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I went through the whole procedure. I asked about the cousin's qualifications, but there were none; I asked about language ability, where the bulk of the family lived and about health; I said that they would have to have a police check&mdash;all the things we do. It was obvious that even on the most generous interpretation this woman would not meet the requirements to migrate to Australia&mdash;not least in that she had a husband in Macedonia, yet she wanted to stay here. I just said, `We can't do this.' I said that, even if she went back to Macedonia and then applied and came out, it would be very difficult. But there was Buckley's chance of getting her status changed from visitor to permanent resident.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My constituent let me know that money was no object. He said, `Colin, it doesn't matter how much it costs.' I said, `It is not really the money. It is not a case of whether you can support the woman here or not. There are requirements and laws, and if she does not meet the requirements you have got Buckley's chance.' It was not a question of money or of his financial support of the cousin, but there was no way that the cousin, on my reading of the points, could migrate to Australia. It was obvious that the person absolutely did not believe me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rightly or wrongly, I do not have many Liberal members of parliament in my area. I used to have a Liberal senator there, and any time people were in a difficult situation like that I  always said to them, `Go and see Senator Baume'&mdash;as it used to be; he had his office in Wollongong. `Don't take my word for it. Go and see Senator Baume.' So I said to this person, because money was no object to him, `Why don't you see a Liberal member? If you think that I am just saying this because I am a member of the opposition or I do not want to take on the case or something like that, go and see one of the government members in our area or in Sydney. But I suspect that that person would come to exactly the same conclusion as mine.' The plot thickened, however, because that guy then told me that he had been to see a migration agent who suggested he come and see me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do you know how much he paid? He paid that migration agent $12,000. Twelve thousand dollars he paid and do you know why he parted with that money? I actually said to him, `Look, mate, you might as well have taken that $12,000 out there on the road and stuck a match to it and burnt it for all the success you are going to get.' That migration agent had promised that person that he would guarantee that that cousin would get permanent residency in Australia. He had given a guarantee. I said, `Did you get it in writing?' He said, `No'. I said, `Mate, before you ever part with money like that, you get something in writing from that migration agent.' He had given $12,000 because the migration agent had promised that they 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10394"> would get that person in. He just could not get that person into Australia. The agent had said he would pull out all stops. I said, `What do you think that person can do that I cannot do as a member of parliament? I can go and see the minister; I can go through the whole thing.' He said, `Colin, he promised me that he would get them permanent residency.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is outrageous that these kinds of promises are made and that such huge fees are taken from these people with so little result at the end of the day. The proposal to self-regulate the migration agents industry is yet another blow to those people who are exploited and vulnerable to the snake oil charms of those expensive advisers. The legislation allows the most unscrupulous migration agents to stay in business, to make their unending promises, to keep sucking money out of people who are vulnerable and lack the knowledge of the processing of attempts to remain in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation provides for the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) to appoint a Migration Institute of Australia, which will be the authority which registers migration agents. Some of the migration institute's responsibilities will be to register applicants and take disciplinary action against registered agents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On page 44 of the bill's explanatory memorandum, it is made clear that the MIA preparation task for its new responsibilities will be quite extensive. It says that the MIA will need to `prepare to take on a role of industry regulator, including building its membership base'. At this time the MIA is a small organisation with a membership not at all representative of the migration agent industry. At the time of the MARS review in 1996, the MIA membership comprised only 12 per cent of migration agents who dealt mainly with migration registration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that when the shadow minister mentioned sham marriages some people objected. I have seen sham marriages down in my area and I tell you one other area that we ought to look at when we are looking at sham marriages. We ought to look at the marriage celebrants. I had a marriage celebrant in my area and he was marrying people so that they could stay here in Australia. They did not have the requirements and I got him into my office and I went through the whole thing with him. I said, `Look, this person was here on a visitors visa or this and that. They don't meet the requirements. Why did you perform this marriage ceremony?' He said to me, `Because there is nothing in the regulations that says that I, as a marriage  celebrant, should check the requirements of people staying here. You check whether they are married or not. You check all sorts of things, but you do not have to check their status in Australia.' They are in Australia as a visitor or whatever it is and they will marry them under the false belief that they will then be allowed to stay in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am most concerned also about the attack on the voluntary system. In my area, we have the Illawarra Migrant Resource Centre, which does a lot of good work. We often work very closely with them on some of these cases. Indeed, we sometimes ask people to go in and see them when it is a really difficult case and we know there is going to be no success. We ask them to confirm our reading of the situation. As I understand it&mdash;and I could be wrong here&mdash;where in the past only one fee has been charged, now each person given advice in that migrant resource centre is going to have to pay the fee. They are not going to be able to do it. I did hear I think it was the member of Petrie say that is was a lower fee. I am not quite sure how much it is, but I mean, this is going to put the&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All right, I will welcome that. As I understand from the quick talk that I have had with the migrant resource centre on this, they are very worried that, if each person 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10395"> is going to be subjected to a fee, then that is going to put them out of that business and they will not be able to afford to pay that fee, especially given the cuts that have been imposed on the migrant resource centres recently. They are not going to be able to afford to pay that fee, therefore they are going to be put out of work. We are going to force these people into the agents who can afford to pay the fee&mdash;the wealthy ones. As I have always said, not every migration agent is a rip&hyphen;off merchant. But, my God, there are enough of them who are rip&hyphen;off merchants to set alarm bells ringing in my mind. I think this is a disastrous step and this is why I so strongly support the amendment moved by the shadow minister.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These cognate bills that we are discussing today, the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R339">Migration Legislation Amendment (Migration Agents) Bill 1997</XREF> , the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R337">Migration Agents Registration Application Charge Bill 1997</XREF> , and the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R338">Migration Agents Registration Renewal Charge Bill 1997</XREF> , will provide certainty and security to some of the most vulnerable people in our society, Australia's would&hyphen;be or newly arrived migrants and their families. I think it is fair to say that all of us who are speaking on this bill recognise the need for such security and for such need to protect the vulnerable in our society. The problems are well known to us. They have certainly been elucidated quite well today by speakers from both sides.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is disagreement about the solution. With that in mind, I, too, rise today to support the government's legislation but oppose the amendments from the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson). In my electorate of Deakin, one in four people, a total of 29,000, were born overseas. Recent evidence suggests their proportion is rising. Over half of Deakin's migrants are from non&hyphen;English speaking countries such as Vietnam, China, Greece and Italy. English is not the main language spoken at one in six homes in my electorate. One in 10 local migrants speaks English not well or not at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These people faced immense challenges as they prepared to move to this country or in sponsoring their relatives to join them. Trying to understand an unknown system of  government and new laws from across the sea is a formidable task for everyone. And it is even harder for those who do not speak English.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These challenges alone prompt many to seek immigration advice from third parties. They have every right to do so, of course, but some people may seek such advice not realising that they do not need it. In some cultures, for example, support from an official is mandatory for dealing with government. Potential migrants from these countries may not realise that they are allowed to apply by themselves in this country. I am aware that cases have also been documented where the migrants somehow gained the impression that a particular migration agent could sway authorities in his or her favour and those migration agents that create that perception, of course, are doing a disservice to their industry at best and are dishonest at most.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where people have migrated and are trying to support their family to join them, the stress of being kept apart from loved ones for a prolonged period sometimes makes them desperate. Sometimes they are pushed to accept the promises of these unscrupulous agents without question. Sadly, often those most at risk are the ones with the most to lose&mdash;those who apply under the humanitarian program. It is heart&hyphen;wrenching for them to know that loved ones live 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10396"> in arduous, even dangerous, conditions in their home country. Who in this situation would not seek out every avenue that offers even the slightest chance of successful reunion?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In both onshore and offshore applications, many humanitarian applicants and their families enter into expensive and often futile appeals out of sheer desperation. In my experience, I have found that many people do not, for example, understand that appeals to the Federal Court can only review the way in which a decision was made and cannot overturn a decision made elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am certainly not saying that migration agents in Australia have a widespread problem with ethical standards. Many in the industry, both profit and non&hyphen;profit, have been shown to provide high levels of service at reasonable charge. Because of that, I am particularly concerned about the amendments that are being proposed by the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson), who talks about self&hyphen;regulation as being some sort of recipe for disaster, as being some sort of anomaly out there amongst the professions. He may not be aware of it, coming from an ACTU and union background, but for those of us who do have a professional background, self&hyphen;regulation is very common. It is very common amongst accountants, lawyers, even with doctors. You cannot get permission to practise in those professions unless you go through the appropriate self&hyphen;regulatory body.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my own profession too, as a psychologist, we have the Australian Psychological Society that regulates the profession and makes sure that we are ethical in what we do and we achieve the required standards that are set down by the profession. It is nothing new. It is not a recipe for disaster. It is commonplace. As we very well know, migration agents often have another profession, a higher profession. In the case of lawyers, of course, they will not only be part of a self&hyphen;regulatory regime for migration agents but also for their own profession at the bar where they operate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Batman also went on to say that a lot of them are crooks and rorters. I say to him that most of the people out there are not crooks and rorters, but in fact are very good, honourable people who have the interests of their clients at heart. Sure, I agree, as the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) has indicated, that there are a few bad apples that spoil it for everyone. But there are other ways in which to tackle those individuals, and I know that self&hyphen; regulation will do that. These crooks and rorters that the member for Batman refers to are not as widespread as he makes out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point that was raised is that migration agents, because they are crooks and rorters, are allowing criminals, prostitutes and other unsavoury characters into this country. Let me say to the honourable member for Batman that if he wants a bill which is going to tackle every specific issue in regard to migration, then it will be a cumbersome effort at best. There is a bill that will be before the House&mdash;in fact, I believe it might even be before the House some time this week; if not, when we come back&mdash;which looks at the whole issue of how we control those migrants or prospective migrants who have a character other than that which is seen to be acceptable in this country. I believe that bill will be the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 8). There are other mechanisms available, if the honourable member for Batman has those concerns; but trying to bring it into this bill and asking that this bill cover these sorts of issues is expecting far too much of one piece of legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia continues to be seen as a land of opportunity, freedom and democracy by people abroad. Given this reputation, no wonder migration advisory services are in demand. Those operating in this industry should be supported to offer their services and make the most of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10397"> what has apparently been an underserviced market. Over the past 18 months, I have worked hard to build a good working relationship with the organisations in my electorate that provide assistance to these people. Groups such as the Communities Councils on Ethnic Issues, the Cambodian Community Welfare Association, the Laotian Migrant Welfare Association and other migrant resource groups provide valuable assistance and advice to newly arrived migrants and their families on a not for profit basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the member for Batman to suggest, as he does in his amendment No. 2, that voluntary agents should not be paying a registration fee, is to miss the point of what the registration fee is all about. The registration fee itself becomes an incentive for those voluntary associations to make sure that their standards of operation, their professionalism, meet the requirements of the migration agents registration scheme. Without the fee, there is little control that can take place. The member for Throsby asked what the fees are. The fee for agents will be $1,000, but the fee for the non&hyphen;fee charging agents will be $450. So there is a wide discrepancy there between the fee charging agents, at $1,000, and the non&hyphen;fee charging agents, at $450.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is an incentive there, of course. If they meet the benchmarks that are required for levels of service, then that fee will subsequently reduce. Re&hyphen;registration, for example, for the voluntary sector agent will then be $350. It is not a burden, as the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) indicated, but certainly something which is manageable within the confines of those voluntary agents&mdash;and what better way to make sure that those voluntary agents, too, meet the standards required?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a relatively young and fast growing industry. After all, the current regulatory framework&mdash;the migration agents registration scheme&mdash;was only established five years ago. Unfortunately, it is an industry where a few bad apples have threatened the reputation of all. Of the 4,000 or so applications for registration since 1992, 400 people have been refused registration and another 780 have been deregistered. So there is a deregistration process that can take place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of the people who have approached my office seeking information on Australia's immigration laws tell me that they do so because they cannot afford the thousands of dollars charged by immigration agents. Others have rung my office in tears because they, too, have  paid considerable sums and feel that the agent is not taking action. So I am at one there with the story that the member for Throsby mentioned to us. It is not unique to one member's office; it is commonplace. But the solution is not necessarily to introduce amendments, as the member for Batman has, but to support self&hyphen;regulation and the bill that is proposed by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Complaints about fees and various unscrupulous practices have been well documented in this House through a series of previous reviews. I applaud the measures contained in this bill that will provide greater protection to migrant families in Deakin and elsewhere by requiring agents to prove that they have kept up with modifications to immigration laws. By improving the complaints process, simple measures, such as mediation, will ease the cost and complexity for migrants and their families while still bringing agents to account for alleged improper actions&mdash;and this service will be free.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Agents will be required to provide a statement of services before being able to claim payments. If payment is made without such a statement being received, the client can reclaim the payment in full. So it is an up&hyphen;front, transparent process that takes place between the client and the migration agent.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10398">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation will continue to ensure that practising lawyers who provide migration advice continue to be governed by the same codes of conduct as other agents. There will be a closing of a loophole that meant people advising on sponsorship or nominations did not have to be registered migration agents, and the establishment of a new body, the Migration Agents Registration Authority, will oversee the new system. There will be a system of penalties for violations which can range up to 10 years gaol for unregistered persons who charge a fee for migration advice services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are the sorts of measures that, even with a self&hyphen;regulatory mechanism, will ensure that the prospective clients are protected from those very unscrupulous agents that the opposition keeps referring to. In addition to establishing new benchmarks for protecting the vulnerable, today's legislation will also set the scene for future industry self&hyphen;regulation without withdrawing that protection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sixteen months ago I argued in this House for an extension to the migration agents registration scheme because self&hyphen;regulation seemed premature at that stage. I also vowed to keep an open mind to the possibility of self&hyphen;regulation. I now feel that the time has come to start offering this industry some additional responsibility, without the government handing over total control just yet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This brings me to the third point of the amendments moved by the member for Batman. Under the self&hyphen;regulation proposal, he says that there will be no overall monitoring authority. What does he think the minister is? The minister is an overall monitoring authority over the entire scheme. He is there and he will be ensuring that not only the principles but the spirit of the legislation, in the way the migration agents perform their work, are maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The changes that we are debating here today will allow the government to reduce the red tape incumbent on migration agents, many of whom of course are small business owners. This is in keeping with our overall commitment as a government to ensuring that small businesses, whatever they are, have government regulation reduced. These changes will challenge those in this industry to continually upgrade their skills and ensure that we do not develop a two&hyphen;tiered industry in this country. The legislation will both require and provide the means for the  hard&hyphen;working people in community organisations to upgrade their skills and ensure that the advice that they provide continues to be of the best possible quality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is right that governments should regularly review the regulation of a relatively new and growing industry such as this, and it is right for industries to move towards self&hyphen;regulation as they mature. It is also right that those operating in such an industry improve their ability to operate ethically and to work with each other to continue to monitor developments in their field. I look forward to being able to advise my constituents that this government is continuing to look after their interests, and I commend the bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, the previous speaker, the member for Deakin (Mr Barresi) talked about self&hyphen;regulation not being new or novel, and about the coalition being committed to cutting red tape for small business&mdash;in this case, the small businesses of migration agents. The proposition turns upon an assumption that self&hyphen;regulation in this industry in particular will be more effective than regulation, notwithstanding the disastrous performance of this industry before it was regulated. That performance has improved under regulation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An example in comparison is the self&hyphen;regulation by the New South Wales Law Society in this particular area versus that of migration agents as covered by the legislation. There have 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10399"> been almost 1,000 complaints from individuals and agents during the term of the current legislation. Out of those complaints, quite a number of convictions of unregistered practices or unregistered agents, cautions, suspensions and cancellations were effected under the legislation. Those successful prosecutions brought about a reduction in real terms of the number of complaints&mdash;as compared with the difficulties that we confronted before the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Compare that situation with the self&hyphen;regulatory practices of the Law Society, which I suppose is a nice comparison. The total number of lawyers suspended by the Law Society of New South Wales, arising from over 1,700 complaints over the entire period of the operation of this legislation, was just one. This is self&hyphen;regulation in what is essentially a closed shop&mdash;not the Migration Institute, which only covers some 10 per cent of the industry; you could hardly describe that as a closed shop. But you could certainly describe the Law Society as a closed shop. It commands a great deal of respect and has many members. Its degree of success of self&hyphen;regulation in this industry resulted in the suspension of just one lawyer. That is how effective self&hyphen;regulation has been in this industry. Compare that with the government's statutory regulations, and it is a much more favourable comparison.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prior to the introduction of the registration scheme by the Labor government in 1992, the provision of immigration advice was always a matter of chance and luck, pretty much. Prior to this time, there was no regulation of the industry other than the limited level of protective provisions in the Migration Act, which focused on misconduct rather than consumer protection. This was not a happy situation for any of the players. The respectable agents were given a bad name by the unscrupulous and ignorant operators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We can look at some of examples of things that happened before we introduced the legislation in 1992. Some of those were compiled by the Immigration Advice and Rights Centre in their report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Free and independent immigration advice</EMPHASIS> which examined data on clients collected between July 1990 and November 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The examples include: an agent who disappeared after being paid for advising a client to lodge an application which could not succeed; an agent who was holding a client's passport  because he still `owed' $800 for his advice bill even though the advice he received was wrong; an adviser who advised a client to apply for an entry permit which could never be granted and charged $3,000 for that advice, and when the client complained the adviser threatened to report her to the Department of Immigration. This is a situation where the clients are utterly powerless and the subject of predatory practices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other examples include: an agent who charged a couple $4,000 to prepare an application that was never lodged; an agent who charged $1,200 to a person from Russia for assistance with filling in an application for a visitors visa extension which was less than one page long; a solicitor who told a client that his occupation was on the priority occupations list when it was not, and this gave the client a falsely positive view of his chances of immigrating to Australia; an agent who assisted a student with an employer nomination scheme application from which he was barred because of the prescribed non&hyphen;citizen ban.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was also the example of an agent, a solicitor who had been struck off, who gave advice to a woman from Korea about lodging a marriage application on the basis of her marriage to an Australian citizen. When the couple eventually paid $2,500 to the agent he then lodged the application several weeks after the woman became illegal. This meant she was bound to fail and would have to apply from overseas after serving a six-month re&hyphen;entry ban.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10400">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The situation before the government instituted the legislation in 1992 was appalling. Yes, there is a great deal of room for improvement, all sides in this debate have observed that, but it is my belief that by removing the regulation that has brought down a reduction in the number of complaints we are going to see a return to the bad old days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The basic aim of this legislation has been described by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) as an interim measure introducing statutory self-regulation for two years in preparation for moves towards full self-regulation after that time. We have the government seeking, by incremental steps, to weaken the system which has been established over the last five years, a system which tries to ensure that consumers of immigration advice can have confidence in the accuracy and timeliness of that advice. However, in the process the government will lose control over the administration of those protections.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The move towards self-regulation was initiated by the review of the migration agents registration scheme which was commissioned by the government in 1996. The review focused on the impact of the scheme on consumer protection and the cost of regulation borne by business. The review found that the existing scheme had achieved consumer protection and had not adversely affected competition in the migration advice market, although there was a recognition that the competency standards in the market could be improved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not oppose improving the competency standards in the market, we just believe that by taking away all the controls and giving them over to an unrepresentative body we will not be able to engineer an increase in the competency standards, neither will we engineer more protection for consumers, and neither will we improve the reputation of this industry which is mired by those unscrupulous agents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Raising the competency standards across any industry is something that we should always aspire to. Essentially, there should be no difference between the quality of advice provided by any of the three occupational groups in the industry. Therefore, the move to require continuing professional development and education, which the minister advises will be required under the regulations from March 1999, is also a positive move.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, it is unclear how competency standards will be improved by the introduction of moves towards self-regulation per se. In fact, I believe the focus on self-regulation of migration agents in this context distracts attention from the other issues which could improve the advice people receive on migration matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These other issues include the clarification of legislation to make it easier for clients to understand, which is a subject that I raised in my previous speech on this legislation, the continuation of moves by the previous government to reduce the number of legislative changes that may occur in migration law each year, to make it more stable, and, finally, adequately resource the department so that departmental officers have the capacity both in time and information to provide high quality advice to a greater number of clients, thereby reducing the need to have immigration advisers at all. But that is another debate entirely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the second reading speech on this bill, the minister pointed out other reasons why full self&hyphen;regulation would not be achievable or desirable in the migration industry. The first reason pointed out was that the consumer group which uses migration agents is quite vulnerable to exploitation by service providers. This is due to a number of factors including language barriers, lack of information about the Australian legal and immigration systems, and the fact 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10401"> that they are unlikely to provide repeat business to the advice provider in the event of their application being successful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That last point is critical because what we do not have here is a free market. What we do not have here is a system where an Australian citizen can just wander between service providers, as they might in the legal profession where the reputations of those providers guides a consumer in the selection of competent advice. Because the consumer does not have any hope of being a repeat consumer, the reputation of the agent is not necessarily as significant as it might be in other industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another reason raised by the minister goes to the composition and operation of the migration advice industry itself. The minister described the industry as `not yet mature.' That assessment raises the question of what it is that will make this industry mature. Nothing has been provided from coalition members and, particularly, the minister as to what it is about this industry that has suddenly become mature or what it is about this legislation that will create a sense of maturity in this industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The three main occupational groups in the industry are lawyers, agents in the private sector of the industry and voluntary sector agents. According to the minister, there is only limited cooperation between these three groups and the proposed migration agents regulation authority, the Migration Institute of Australia. Indeed, the institute covers only 10 per cent of registered migration agents. It makes a farce of the concept of self&hyphen;regulation when the proposed body to self&hyphen;regulate is so unrepresentative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, it is not like the Law Society of New South Wales, where they managed to effect one suspension. They are a closed shop. The coalition is proposing to hand over self-regulation to a mob that only has 10 per cent membership of the industry. In fact, the minister's speech provides no positive reason for travelling down the path of self-regulation at all. The primary concerns he raised in his speech regarding the barriers of the client group to introducing self&hyphen;regulation, and the composition of the industry, are unlikely to change in the next two years, nor have we been provided with any propositions as to why they would change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Migrants to Australia will always be more likely than Australian&hyphen;born people to experience language barriers, unless we move to a discriminatory migration program, which we must  avoid. Labor abolished the discriminatory migration program and it should stay that way. They will always be less familiar with the legal and migration systems. They will only need to go through the migration process once, thereby avoiding the consumer protection incentive of possible repeat business for the service provider, as I have mentioned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even if we assume that consumer protection factors which were, after all, the primary reason for the enactment of the original legislation are not important to the minister, the other issues of industry barriers to self&hyphen;regulation have not been addressed. The minister, in June, stated a commitment to the provision of voluntary or not for profit advice. Therefore, it appears that his goal is to eliminate the voluntary sector and thereby stimulate the for profit sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, it is unlikely that the minister could seriously consider he was able to reduce the representation of lawyers amongst the industry. No government has been able to significantly reduce the courts' influence on the migration program. That is evidenced by the minister's own admission that he is the most sued minister in the Commonwealth. I do not think that that is something that he would be happy about. Certainly, I would not be happy about it if I were in his position. But this legislation is going to turn up the heat even more: there will 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10402"> be more litigation as a result of this legislation because we will not be knocking out the unscrupulous operators as we otherwise would.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, given that the review of the scheme was the first review by the Commonwealth as a party to the competition principles agreement, it is unlikely that the minister will be attempting to be reducing the involvement of the business sector in the provision of immigration advice. Neither is it likely he will be seeking to reduce diversity in the industry overall.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If these three groups are to be retained within the industry, it is unclear how giving 10 per cent of the industry in the form of the Migration Institute of Australia control over self&hyphen;regulation will promote competition between the sectors. That is particularly so when complaints against lawyers were able to be referred to their own professional bodies for disciplinary action. How effective has that been shown to be in the past? It has not been very effective at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another concern is that the move to self&hyphen;regulation may indicate to unscrupulous service providers&mdash;which we as parliamentarians deal with quite often, or with the consequences of their shonky advice&mdash;that the government is less serious about maintaining control over fraud and misconduct in the immigration program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs annual report of 1995&hyphen;96, the department showed a reduction in refusals by the registration board and an 8.4 per cent reduction in the number of complaints as a result of a number of factors. The department attributed the increased successful applications for registration to, in its words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . an increased awareness of the standards required for registration, better self&hyphen;selection amongst applicants, and a substantial reduction in the number of cases where the applicant was relying on their practice in the industry prior to the introduction of the scheme, to meet entry standards.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is, the regulations brought about a reduction in the number of either shonky claims or claims that had been made where perhaps they really should not have been. Whilst there are problems in this industry and the legislation should be toughened up, there has been no real reason advanced by coalition members as to why we should take away those things which have stimulated an improvement in this industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, the drop in the number of complaints cited in that report is an indication that the scheme has improved standards of practice in the industry. This scheme has only had five years to bed itself down. The figures show that it has improved the industry. For the government to chop and change, and go down the path of self&hyphen;regulation at this stage, is inappropriate and risks the positive efforts made by the department to both control the program and protect the rights of consumers. Both are important. Although this bill is not seeking full self&hyphen;regulation at this stage, it is explicit that that is the goal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are other aspects of the legislation which require consideration in more detail. The bill represents a retreat from comprehensive complaints handling and disciplinary processes towards mediation. This is a worry in that a major aim of the scheme under Labor was to address the power imbalance between consumers and advice providers. It is difficult to see how this is going to be achieved through mediation. The shonky operators who make money out of operating shonkily are not going to be mediated out of their practice. If they do not have regulation to pull them up, they are going to keep doing it.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10403">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another aspect which is of concern is the removal of the cross&hyphen;subsidy. Under the current arrangements, volunteer bodies who provide free or not for profit immigration advice already pay significant costs for the privilege of providing immigration advice to consumers who cannot afford to pay for it. The need to ensure that voluntary agents have up&hyphen;to&hyphen;date legislation and regulations costs at least $500 a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have the government imposing further continuing education costs on volunteer organisations, as well as fees equal to that of profit service providers, who can charge as much as they like to recoup their costs. We have heard quite a lot about the very high charges that are applied. A better prioritisation would be to require continuing education in the sector, but to continue to exempt it from fees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This question of exempting the not for profit sector from fees was addressed by the minister in his speech in June. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We expect that those people who are offering free advice through voluntary agencies ought to be the subject of supervisory arrangements. They will still have to be registered. They will not have to pay a fee . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The minister came into this place and said that the not for profit sector in this industry will not have to pay a fee, but the legislation says that they will. I am not quite sure what the minister is on about frankly. He is saying that they will not have to pay a fee, but it is very clear from coalition members today, and from the legislation, that they will have to pay a fee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is clearly designed to run the not for profit sector out of business. And do you know where all the applications are going to come? They are going to come to us; that is where they are going to come. The people who cannot afford to fork out $10,000 for shonky advice are going to come to us. The question then arises as to whether members of this house are going to be covered by the scope of this scheme, but that is a question for another debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government is really serious about stopping fraud in the migration program, particularly in the marriage categories, then we will need to ensure that the industry is regulated. There is no suggestion that the industry association will be adequately resourced to ensure that the migration agents who specialise in marriage cases are able to be adequately scrutinised. There is nothing in this legislation to provide us with any surety that the institute does have the resources or the capacity&mdash;or the commitment, for that matter&mdash;to regulate the  shonky operators. It is my view that the institute will not administer, to any satisfactory standard, self&hyphen;regulation&mdash;nor can it with such a narrow base within this industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, self&hyphen;regulation for this industry, in particular, is inadvisable. The minister has, essentially, made statements to that effect in his second reading speech. The shadow minister certainly concurs that this is not an industry that we can move to self&hyphen;regulate. We need to keep the rules. We need to keep the protection both for the national interest and for the sake of the consumers and we need to make sure that the not for profit providers are not applied with fees as was undertaken by the minister in this place in his previous speech.</PARA></SPEECH>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10404"> its clauses to attempt to fix up the government's failure to put forward appropriate legislation before this House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Migration related issues are very important in my electorate. My office does a large amount of assistance for people having problems with immigration issues. My electorate also has a large number of community based organisations doing similar work. I am fortunate to have on my staff Helen Rogers, who deals almost exclusively&mdash;three days a week&mdash;with immigration issues and with the multicultural community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But this legislation proposes to move the migration industry towards self&hyphen;regulation. This is a move which has created a great deal of concern from, in particular, the ethnic communities in my electorate. These groups believe&mdash;and I support the view&mdash;that the migration agents registration scheme, implemented by the former Labor government, has started to successfully improve standards in the industry. The primary objective of the scheme to ensure that people seeking immigration advice could be confident of competent and ethical advice is now being achieved. Improved protection for consumers will be severely compromised by deregulation at this stage. Now is not the time for deregulation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Groups concerned with the welfare of migrant Australians, such as the New South Wales Ethnic Communities Council, have made their opposition to this legislation and to deregulation very clear. One of the primary concerns of the ECC is that it is completely inappropriate for the migration agents registration board, which is, essentially, a regulatory industry watchdog, to be exposed to the principles of competition policy. The ECC said in their submission on the review of the migration agents registration scheme last year that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ECC of New South Wales believes the application of competition principles abdicates governmental responsibility in migration services to the wider community as a whole. The government has a role to play in ensuring the services provided to the community are provided at a standard that protects people in vulnerable situations. People wishing to migrate to Australia or family members looking to unite through immigration are often in a vulnerable position and may become prey to unscrupulous agents. Migration is a very emotive issue. The ECC of New South Wales believes the government has a duty to protect these people.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I certainly endorse those comments because there can be no doubt that people seeking advice on immigration matters are a particularly vulnerable group in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, these people are often dealing with issues that concern their loved ones, their spouses or hopefully future spouses, their brothers and sisters, their parents and their children. Often,  in these situations, these vulnerable members of the community are susceptible to unscrupulous agents who may well be about lining their own pockets, rather than providing ethical and appropriate services. People seeking assistance often cannot speak or read English, or at least not fluently. This is in an environment where this government has cut back migrant services such as the Adult Migrant English Service. At the same time as there is an attack on the ability of the community to provide ESL services, you have this change which will severely impact on members of the community who do not speak English as their first language.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These consumers are also unlikely to be aware of avenues of redress such as consumer complaint tribunals. So the unscrupulous agents would be fully aware that they have a greater chance of getting away with shonky arrangements and exploitation than if they were dealing with people who had been established members of the community, who had a greater level of language skills and greater connections with legal services. They are also dealing with an immigration process that is completely culturally unfamiliar, and they have no concept of what to expect from agents&mdash;about what is acceptable and what is not acceptable.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10405">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current scheme should, as a minimum position, maintain the current level of regulation. Indeed, I think, there is a case for tightening regulation as opposed to the deregulation which this bill proposes. I am not suggesting that all migration agents are unscrupulous, but there are certainly some who are. The fact is that, as a parliament, we have a responsibility to defend and protect the interests of intending migrants, their families, friends and employers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To make the scheme more accountable, there are two points to make. Firstly, there are a number of migration agents operating who make unrealistic promises to clients. I am sure that all of the representatives in this chamber today would have specific examples of cases where constituents have come to them in that situation. I intend to go through a number of cases later on in this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The action of these agents ensures that, although the case is doomed to failure, it will drag on for as long as possible, because the objective is not to assist the people requiring help and advice. The objective is to maximise the profit for the migration agent. The longer the case, the further it can be drawn out and the more money can be demanded from these vulnerable people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In order to achieve this dragging out process, clients are often advised to apply for visas that they have no chance of getting. When the primary decision is finally made, the agents then use the review processes to further extend the case. In the meantime, clients are on bridging visas that allow them to remain in Australia and usually to work. For clients who cannot work, the situation is even more dire. This not only creates unnecessary delays for other, more genuine applicants who would have an entitlement to permanent residency but this practice also gives clients unrealistic hopes about gaining that permanent residency. They can waste years of their lives&mdash;and thousands of dollars&mdash;when they could be establishing a life for themselves elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, agents can mislead applicants into believing that their case can be processed onshore when they are in fact banned from doing so under section 48 of the act, having previously been refused a permanent visa onshore. In these cases, the applicants may well be eligible for a permanent visa, but only if they apply offshore. When they are not told about this, they can waste both their time and the department's time with an invalid application.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You only have to look at the number of Pacific islanders with no grounds for permanent residency who applied for protection visas after the 1987 coup in Fiji. Many of these people  were advised to do so by migration agents, particularly, I believe, by one I will call M, who is now deregistered. There also needs to be tighter regulations to prosecute people who are posing as registered agents. At present, the department must have proof that the bogus agent has helped someone in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to run through some specific examples of disreputable agents that have come through in my electorate. I obviously will not be using the real names of my constituents, as I certainly want to respect their privacy. But I can assure members that this is but a small sample of people who have come to my attention in recent times.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first example I will give is that of agent S. This woman, who is an agent, has caused great problems for two of my constituents&mdash;a couple. I will call the male M and the female B. M is a Fijian national who is barred under section 48 of the act from applying for permanent residence onshore. Agent S was handling the case and told the couple that they could apply in Australia. She held on to the file for six to eight months before finally lodging the application. Soon after, the couple were told the application was invalid&mdash;not surprisingly.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10406">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">M then went to Fiji to apply there. His wife is 45 years old and desperate to have a child. She is running out of time, and now her husband may be in Fiji for almost a year. If they had known this, he could have gone back 12 months ago, applied in accordance with the proper processes and, hopefully, he would have been back here by now and both of them would have been settled together. The agent involved has been reported to the department and I believe they hope to prosecute, which would indicate that this is not the only case that this particular unscrupulous agent has mishandled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second example I will give is that of someone who is not a registered agent but passes himself off as one. I will call him T. He is basically completely incompetent and has wasted hours of staff time at the Rockdale office of the department. He has taken money from many of my constituents and has produced no results.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One particular case involved a family who were trying to get their brother back to Australia. T took their money and gave them false hopes when the case was hopeless. The boy in question had been criminally deported after serving a sentence for manslaughter. He will never be allowed back into Australia, and that is appropriate, yet still this person has been accepting money from this family. This person posed as a solicitor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In another example, he took $5,000 in advance to handle a preferential family case. He guaranteed the case would be finalised in six months or the money would be refunded. Of course, that was a verbal guarantee. Two years later when we asked for the money back on behalf of the constituents&mdash;my staffer assisted the constituents because they did not have the language skills to draft letters themselves&mdash;he refused and sent them threatening letters back. Further investigation showed that this person was fraudulently posing as a solicitor. He was not a solicitor, but because he happened to be of the same ethnic group as the people who were applying he was using his position in the community to exploit these people to the tune of $5,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another example is someone who is now disbarred and was prosecuted by the DPP with the help of evidence from one of my constituents. We have not got the result, so I am not sure if the case has been successful as yet. He submitted an inadequate application which subsequently failed, due to his incompetence, and for which he charged thousands of dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We see these cases, not yearly, not monthly, not weekly, but just about daily. And the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) knows, because I have had  discussions with him personally&mdash;and so have my staff with his departmental officers&mdash;and he knows that there are literally dozens of these unscrupulous agents out there ripping off people. And, the solution is not to say, `That is occurring. We will let them run their own show.' The solution is certainly not that, and that is why we have moved the amendment before this House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another major concern I have with this legislation is the costs associated with registration&mdash;and section 2 of the amendment moved by the member for Batman covers this very adequately. I am sure that the will give that particular clause a great deal of thought before deciding to support it. I know that he will also be concerned about community groups that currently offer free advice to migrants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my area there are a large number of these groups carrying out excellent work with intending migrants and their sponsors. Community groups include the May Murray Neighbourhood Centre, just down the road from my office, which has workers from the Vietnamese, Arabic, Pacific Islander, Greek and Chinese communities. They are all working 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10407"> damned hard for very little money themselves, it must be said, because they are honourable people who care about the community. We have migrant resource centres at Ashfield and Campsie which&mdash;when the migrant resource centre at Ashfield is not busy helping the member for Lowe (Mr Zammit) with his internal party activities&mdash;does good work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other groups assisting migrants in my electorate include the Arabic Welfare Association at Bankstown. We have the Australia Lebanese Association, and the Newtown Neighbourhood Centre, which has a number of workers from similar communities to those of the May Murray Centre but also has a Yugoslav community worker who does a great deal of work out there. And we have, of course, the Immigration Advice and Rights Centre. For groups with a number of multilingual workers, you might be talking about having to register half&hyphen;a&hyphen;dozen agents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is vital that these services be retained. Not only do they often offer multilingual services, but they can also be accessed by people who are financially disadvantaged. These communities, as a result of this legislation, will have to choose. They will have to charge fees for that advice, or stop giving it, and this will force many community organisations, already under severe constraints with cutbacks from government funding, out of offering that advice. It will mean that their clients will be either queuing up at our doors&mdash;at the offices of members of parliament&mdash;or, because they are not aware of those services, they will seek assistance from private agencies. That may well be okay if they go to the right ones, but in a deregulated environment there will be more shonks out there. The community sector, the non&hyphen;profit sector, must be exempted from the registration charges in accordance with the minister's comments&mdash;but not in accordance with the act&mdash;and thereby be excluded from these charges. The non&hyphen;profit sector must be excluded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other issues of concern with these bills include the lack of a complaints resolution procedure. The provision in the bill for a complainant and agent to be referred to a mediator is a poor substitute, and it absolutely ignores the power imbalance between an unscrupulous agent and a vulnerable client who may have a poor grasp of English. The provision of a 10&hyphen;day period only for consumers to lodge objections is an onerous responsibility when you are talking about consumers who are not aware of their rights. If they find out two weeks later, it is too late. This bill represents a conflict of interest where the monitoring body, the regulator, is another association member. If there is one area where self&hyphen;regulation should not occur, it is here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also concerned about the bill because it will impact severely on some of the most disadvantaged of my constituents. Now that the migration agents registration scheme is starting to work well, we should not be cutting it back. The government should be building on and strengthening the scheme, but I guess that would not be likely. It would certainly be easy to get the impression that the Howard government is not really fond of migrants, based on its performance to date. The fact is that it is consistent with their cynical exploitation of the Hanson agenda, their preparedness to step back and their failure to show leadership on the issue of race in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you need a model of where deregulation goes to, based on ideological creed rather than commonsense, you can look at a number of examples. Take the Victorian Premier's example of deregulation of the health system, where you now have salmonella outbreaks, and ambulances just do not show up after they have been called. That is the sort of world that we live in when we have deregulation in an inappropriate fashion.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10408">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude my comments today by saying that the amendments moved by the member for Batman are entirely appropriate and deserve the support of this House. This House should be about protecting the most vulnerable people in society, and certainly that is the objective of the amendments. Now is not the time for greater deregulation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have had the opportunity to speak on the area of the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R339">Migration Legislation Amendment (Migration Agents) Bill 1997</XREF>  on a number of occasions and I will not unnecessarily detain people today. I have also had the opportunity of course to participate in the 1995 inquiry by the joint committee in relation to this field. I would have thought that, whilst the current Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) at that period was part of an opposition group that essentially did support deregulation, the evidence before the committee was in general extremely poor. From recollection, the only group that was actually critical in any real fashion of the operation of the board was the Springvale Migrant Resource Centre, or some such similar title, who&mdash;quite frankly&mdash;under examination, were less than convincing. In other words, the main thrust of that inquiry was that there should be a three&hyphen;year extension and a review, as a compromise between the two parties at that stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say that there are positive aspects to this legislation. Certainly, in regard to sponsorships and nominations, a loophole that was in the previous legislation is now being tackled. The previous government certainly was aware of that, and I would be very supportive of that change. Similarly, it is quite rational and sensible that travel agents who give very minor advice should not be picked up by the legislation. There are some, as I say, positive aspects to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I really do question the fundamental thrust of deregulating this industry. Many previous speakers have indicated that it is a very unequal balance in this particular field. It is not a situation where there is always actually competition. The reality is that various ethnic communities tend to go to a practitioner who is of their particular ethnic extraction. So, to some extent, there is a degree of monopoly in certain fields. Obviously, as people have indicated previously, people are indeed very vulnerable. They are very desperate: they come from countries that have far worse social and economic conditions than we do, they are prepared to basically do anything to escape that plight and they will grab at any straw to try to stay in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are well aware of some aspects of this area. The member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese) earlier indicated the amount of money that these people charge for very little work, and the degree of incompetence in the field. That is not to deny that there are some very capable people and some very genuine practitioners who, at the same time, have a slant which talks about human rights and about the interests of their clients. But the area has been characterised by a large degree of opportunism and very mercenary attitudes by many.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to also say that, if you are realistic about this field, you have also got to admit that often the clients themselves are just as guilty and are often part of the conspiracy to basically undermine Australia's migration regulations and laws. We should not always assume that, in each and every case where the agent launches ridiculous or preposterous claims, it is not without the connivance of the client. Often, these people are very willing parties, and that is a fact of life which should not be ignored.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The migration agents registration scheme review is less than convincing about the need for change. As other speakers have indicated, this is more driven by ideological requirements, a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10409"> thrust by the government which simply does not like a government role in the field, and it is a repeat of what we have seen through other sectors of the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, one key finding states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in the absence of regulation, the market for migration advice has tended to operate imperfectly with consumers bearing unacceptable cost in terms of exploitation and inappropriate practice by a sector of the industry. . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Another finding was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that the Scheme has provided a measure of consumer protection and . . . its credibility as a consumer protection mechanism has strengthened somewhat in the time since the Joint Standing Committee on Migration (JSCM) conducted its review of the Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Furthermore, the scheme has not adversely affected competition in the migration advice market. The only real point they made was the need for further training in the field, and I do not dispute that. That has got nothing to do with whether we hand over control of this industry to a body that represents practitioners who themselves&mdash;and the minister has often admitted this&mdash;are often very questionable. The report itself makes clear they only cover 10 per cent of the industry and, given the nature of the people that both sides of parliament have questioned, it really is a matter of conjecture as to whether we can rely on them to properly police the industry. The review certainly is not very decisive and convincing in regard to the need to hand it over to this group. It states on page 31:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are limits to the incentives that government would be able to provide to encourage agents to join the industry association both in times of restraint in government spending and in the migration law context.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It further notes that the association was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . unrepresentative of the three distinct occupational groupings in the migration advice industry. It will become more difficult to establish consistent professional standards and to coordinate activities such as entry level training.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It notes on page 33:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At this stage, the industry has a disparate nature and the industry association has only limited coverage and as a result, the body that takes on the role of industry regulator may face legal and other challenges.</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The minister is postponing the final drift towards them controlling the industry but I do not think a very strong case has been made out so that they should be the paramount force in this industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister might have been pushed in this direction by others and there might be a very tortuous process of getting there, but the fundamental thrust is to basically give management of the industry over to this group, which his own review states is not very representative, and I do not see any major evidence that it is going to become any more representative.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You are very selective in your reading of that report, and you, as a member of it, would be quite aware that that is not the major thrust of that inquiry at all. The essential thrust was for a continued government presence in the field.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mentioned some admirable aspects of the legislation earlier. I think the need for training in the voluntary sector is also commendable. One cannot just take the view that these people are there for the community benefit and therefore we can allow them to be untrained and unskilled. I very much commend the government for going in that direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the idea of forcing voluntary groups to pay is questionable. Occasionally, you might get people who put their ethnic loyalty before adherence to our laws, and there are questions about some of the advice given, but to ask these groups to pay&mdash;groups that are there mainly for community purposes, mainly to help people in dire circumstances, mainly to help people who do not have knowledge, mainly to help people who do not have the language&mdash;is undermining their operations. Asking them to pay is not a move in the right direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The situation is that the earlier report which the minister cited&mdash;that is, the joint migration committee report&mdash;was not quite as fulsome in the points that it makes. In giving its account of the industry in paragraph 3.53 on page 53 of the report, the committee noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A common theme in submissions was that regulation of the migration advice industry is necessary to ensure consumer protection and the maintenance of appropriate standards within the industry. IARC, for example commented:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a regulatory scheme is necessary to support the reputable people working in this area as well as to eradicate the unscrupulous and incompetent operators.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Just after that, at paragraph 3.54, it noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In some submissions, it was argued that regulation of migration advisers is required because of the vulnerability of persons seeking immigration advice.</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . immigration is a field which has some unique features which merit special regulation in that the client base is, more often than not, in a particularly vulnerable position and this is the case even with clients who can speak English fluently and are highly educated.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Further, at paragraph 3.82, page 61, the committee noted:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Statistics obtained by the Committee support a finding that the achievements of the Scheme relevant to its objectives have been chequered.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Quite frankly, the review that the minister has commissioned makes a similar point about the performance of the current system. The paragraph continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the positive side, around 600 persons either have been denied the right to practise as migration agents or have decided to withdraw from seeking entry to the industry. In addition, the avenues for developing expertise in migration law have increased noticeably, with various courses and seminars now being conducted at a tertiary level and within the industry itself.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As I say, this is not really driven by an analysis of the industry. It is not driven by a conclusion as to what is best for the industry; it is driven because the government essentially believes that competition policy should rule. It does not analyse the particular nature of the industry. It does not have any understanding of the special problems faced by these people. It essentially opens the floodgates for exploitation. It turns over control to an unrepresentative 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10411"> group that includes these same people that both sides of the House are often critical of, and it really is a very questionable direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also of a concern to me personally&mdash;and other speakers have raised this matter&mdash;that after Cunliffe, and the victory of the department with regard to regulation of lawyers, I do not have the confidence that the minister seems to have in the ability of the Law Society, and other bodies, to police those people in this field. Quite frankly, I have not seen in the media or heard on the public record much evidence that these bodies are all that efficient in policing their own members. Obviously, there is a degree of self&hyphen;interest in the image of the industry in making sure that, often, these complaints are minimised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that the scheme has worked. There are concerns that perhaps the onus is such that people often do not bring forward cases. I could probably be accused of it myself: I see activities by migration agents that probably should lead me to lay complaints but I guess there is a concern that, with the requirements of evidence, et cetera, it will not accomplish very much. One of the failings in the industry is that we have not been proactive enough in making sure that people feel that they can be successful in pursuing the more dubious practitioners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, on balance, we have a situation here where there is a need for the government to have an overview of the industry. I an not only concerned&mdash;as I said earlier&mdash;with the nature of the practitioners but I also believe that it is very important for this country, and for the integrity of the system, that we are proactive to the fact of life out there that many of the clients are often just as questionable in the way in which they launch claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government should be very proactive in making sure that we give a signal to the industry that launching claims to buy time, and launching claims that manipulate Australia's refugee and humanitarian aspects, are not to be condoned. As I said earlier, I commend these amendments. I do not think the minister or his review or the review by the previous joint migration committee have made any case whatsoever for turning over control of this industry to an unrepresentative body in a field that both sides of politics knew would require, initially, strong intervention to police it. No case has been made out. It is essentially driven by an ideological position and does not analyse what has happened under this current scheme or the solution to the problems that are there.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is the case, as all members of parliament know, that youth suicide is one of the most intractable social problems facing our community today. It is however also true that it is not a new problem. All the statistics that were presented at the seminar that we had suggest that the rates of attempted and completed suicide among young people are increasing. But it is still very difficult to measure, given that many suicides used to be reported as accidents because of the stigma that previously applied to suicide. Indeed, experts at the committee's seminar believed that the current statistics also underestimate the real extent of the problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Suicide affects young people from all socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds in our country, although we do know that certain groups are at greater risk. Completed suicides among young men are four times higher than for young women. Some have attributed this to a greater confusion among young men about their role and their failure to adjust to women's greater equality. In fact, the explanation seems to be much more straightforward. Sadly, it is the case that many young men complete their suicide attempts because they use immediately lethal weapons, especially guns. More young women use drugs and poisons from which there is a greater chance of resuscitation. Were accurate statistics available on suicide attempts, rather than completed suicides, they would be more likely to show a smaller variation between the sexes. From my point of view, to focus on the gender differences sometimes clouds the issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Experts at the seminar identified a number of groups at particular risk. They included young people in rural and remote areas, young Aboriginal people, young people confused about their sexual identity, those suffering from mental illness&mdash;particularly depression&mdash;and those  suffering the effects of family breakdown. It is very true, as all who have contributed to this debate have said, that youth suicide is far too important an issue for political point scoring, because all parties are concerned about the problem and are committed to tackling it. Both the current and the previous government have allocated resources to initiatives designed to reduce its incidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some other initiatives of this government will also, I believe, contribute to a reduction in the incidence of completed youth suicides. The most important of these has been the gun buyback scheme which, by reducing the number of firearms in the community, will reduce accessibility to guns, among some young men at least. For this, we can be very pleased. Given that this is the preferred and the most lethal method of suicide among young men, it is to be hoped that it will result in the reduction in the number of completed suicides for this group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are other measures particularly affecting young people in rural and remote communities that do however remain of some concern. Many of these communities are suffering significant hardships. These are not just from recent changes. I am not trying to apportion any blame but it is the case that many communities in rural areas are facing significant hardship from the closure of services. At a time when young people are calling out for help from these services, we really need to make sure that they are provided.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10413">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do know that young Aboriginal people are at particular risk of suicide and many of the programs that are designed to help these young Aboriginal people in their communities really need our support. We must, of course, through both the Wik debate and our response to the stolen children report, acknowledge the damage that has been done to Aboriginal people by all past government policies and begin the process of reconciliation. Without that, the most important thing, it is very hard to imagine how we might begin the very long process of overcoming what is the serious despair among young Aboriginal people, which too often manifests itself in deliberately dangerous behaviour and sometimes suicide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also learned at the seminar about the contribution of anxiety and confusion about sexual identity and sexual orientation in triggering suicide among young people. I understand that there has recently been a poster and a booklet prepared by the Western Australian AIDS Council aimed at sexually confused young people contemplating suicide. It is very important that we face up to the problems that young people have in confronting their sexual identity and their sexual orientation and that we actually take it upon ourselves to do some of the things that might be seen to be unusual that encourage people to talk to others about these matters of confusion and concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do owe it to our young people to support any measure which might reduce the incidence of youth suicide in this country. Often that will mean that we have to be more innovative in our approaches, and that might sometimes challenge our particular views of the world&mdash;those of people of our generation, I mean.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to support initiatives which have been shown to work and to look at other options in cases where they have failed. The committee seminar did provide some very useful insights into past successes and also some directions for the future, for example the need to provide a more user-friendly approach to counselling and mental health services for young people themselves and for those to whom they are likely to turn for support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Seminar participants also pointed to the need for all hospitals&mdash;and I think this was a very important point that was made&mdash;to institute follow&hyphen;up care to young people who have been discharged following a suicide attempt and to the need to support families caring for a child  at risk. There is a need to realise that the families where we have children who are attempting suicide are also going through a very difficult time and they are in great need of support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are gradually learning more about youth suicide and how to deal with it, and the seminar that was conducted by the committee has contributed to that process. I certainly commend the report on the seminar to all members of the House and support its recommendations. Certainly, from our side of the parliament, we will be seeking to work very cooperatively with other members of parliament to ensure that the incidence of suicide amongst our young people is reduced. Thank you.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased today to have the opportunity to speak on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs report called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Aspects of youth suicide</EMPHASIS> . I have waited a number of weeks for the opportunity to speak on this report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Youth suicide, in fact suicide of all ages, is a national tragedy. As reported in paragraph 17 of the report, in 1995 there were 350 young male suicides and 84 young female suicides. Members of the committee were shocked to hear that children as young as 12 had attempted suicide.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10414">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the central coast of New South Wales, which includes my electorate of Robertson, the suicide rate for young people is twice the national average. It is so easy to talk about the facts and figures and the statistics, but each and every single one of these young people causes immense tragedy and trauma&mdash;not only to themselves but to their friends and to their family and to the community in general.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even before I was elected to the Australian parliament, I met with Mr Eric Trezise, a central coast resident who is at the forefront of the fight against youth suicide, and suicide in general. Mr Trezise had been working hand&hyphen;in&hyphen;hand with the central coast coroner, Mr Bryan Wilson, and they convened the first central coast suicide summit in early 1996. This, to my knowledge, was the first community initiated summit on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some years ago, Mr Wilson, the coroner, recognised the fact that the central coast was having a high proportion of deaths by suicide. He was concerned that there were no identifiable records kept for each region on suicide and youth suicide. It was Mr Wilson who first started keeping records on suicide deaths. That is one of the flaws, and I am distressed to hear other members say, `We have tried to identify what the youth suicide problem is in our particular area.' In fact, there are no statistics in their areas, broken down by region or electorate, to help them identify the problem or how great it is in a specific area. Mr Wilson is possibly the first coroner in Australia to recognise that fact and to have records going back a number of years to help with this problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The central coast community recognised even then that we were in the grip of a major epidemic and, as a community, we had to act to do something about it. The central coast suicide summit was attended by local politicians from all sides of politics and by representatives from almost all community groups on the central coast. Approximately 300 people attended that meeting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The summit made a number of recommendations, which I had the pleasure of forwarding to the then Minister for Family Services, the member for Pearce (Mrs Moylan). As a result of this report and submissions made by many other members throughout Australia, members of the committee identified Australia's high rate of youth suicide as a problem that needed to be highlighted in the parliament and brought into focus by this committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The aspects of youth suicide seminar was convened on 28 February 1997, in order to gather information such as that collected at the central coast suicide summit to give committee members a comprehensive overview of the issues involved. The seminar also provided an invaluable opportunity for peak health and community groups, local organisations, youth workers, academics and professionals to exchange information about the suicide prevention programs throughout Australia. Among the invited guests was Mr Eric Trezise. At that seminar, I had the opportunity of introducing Mr Trezise to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). Mr Trezise had the opportunity to put his views and his concerns about the situation on the central coast directly to the Prime Minister. I would also like to put on the record that I was a participant at the seminar and found it very valuable and informative. Unfortunately, my name was omitted from the report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Central Coast community is not standing still on this issue. We are not waiting for governments to take the lead. As a community, we are taking the lead. Only recently, I attended the launch and had the opportunity of addressing the audience at the launch of the Central Coast Suicide Safety Network. The Central Coast Suicide Safety Network was launched by the Premier of New South Wales, the Hon. Bob Carr, who has agreed to become 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10415"> the patron of the network. The launch was attended by over 300 concerned community leaders, as yet another step in the fight against youth suicide and suicide in general on the central coast.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The aims of the Suicide Safety Network are: to raise awareness of the tragic loss of life to suicide in the central coast region of Australia, with emphasis on all age groups; to make the public and the governments&mdash;local, state and federal&mdash;aware of the needs for a collaborative and concerted attack on this problem; to draw attention to the factors which play a role in attempted suicide and to foster appropriate prevention and support initiatives; to highlight the suffering of those bereaved by suicide and those distressed by attempted suicide, and to encourage self&hyphen;help groups; to install a direct access telephone service responding to suicide crisis calls; to establish a psychological and sociological autopsy suicide case review panel; to promote trial and pilot programs aimed at reducing the incidence of suicide and attempted suicide amongst all age groups; and to solicit funding and resources to enable these programs to become reality. You can see that the aims of this network are very comprehensive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the major contributing factors identified in the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Aspects of youth suicide</EMPHASIS> is isolation and loneliness. In paragraph 41 of the report, the committee was told that any kind of youth support service must be targeted appropriately, otherwise young people will not access the service. Professional centres requiring appointments during school or work hours, or where a payment is required, will not meet the needs of many young people. Telephone lines, such as Lifeline, are also a valuable resource as they can provide 24&hyphen;hour assistance and provide immediate counselling and contact to those young people at a time when they are most vulnerable to suicide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am aware that under the Here for Life program the government has allocated over $1 million for improving communication networks among suicide prevention workers and coordinating information dissemination. In the 1996&hyphen;97 budget, under the national youth suicide strategy, the government has provided over $19 million over three years to be spent in this area, including $6 million to Lifeline and Kids Helpline for the telephone counselling services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an admirable initiative and is to be commended. Current funding for youth suicide prevention amounts to $30 million, and the committee recognised that while this amount is  significant much more still needs to be done. This includes research, coordination, education and counselling services. In paragraph 55 the committee recognised that consideration needed to be given to the possible reallocation of some of the existing funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We on the Central Coast of New South Wales have been advocating for some time the establishment of a specific suicide prevention advisory phone counselling service for the Central Coast. It has been identified by a number of those who have been affected by this tragedy that the most effective way that the Central Coast community can help stop this tragic waste of human life is to have this specific phone counselling and assistance service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have the premises, we have the trained staff, we have the volunteers on the Central Coast who can provide this service. What we do need is government funds to fund the service. I would appeal to the Minister for Family Services, Warwick Smith, and the Minister for Health and Family Services, Dr Wooldridge, to consider looking at our submission from the Central Coast for the provision of this telephone counselling service. I have already had discussions with Dr Wooldridge and, of course, like every Australian, he is concerned about the suicide problem that we have in Australia, not just the youth suicide problem.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10416">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst youth suicide is receiving a great deal of coverage, and it is a high profile concern to everybody, there is a major problem&mdash;and we have identified this on the Central Coast&mdash;with men aged between 25 and 45 who are not coping with the stresses of life. They are not coping with the responsibilities, as they see it, of raising families, of mortgages or losing jobs. They are what we call on the Central Coast the hidden tragedy of suicide. They are the people that cost our community far more than anyone else. The loss of the life of a person in the prime of their life, when they have children or family responsibilities and work, and the loss and tragedy for the community that are caused by someone in that age bracket taking their life are immense. It is something that we on the Central Coast wish to highlight&mdash;not only the youth suicide program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that Dr Wooldridge is looking at what we are saying and at the submissions that we are putting up. Very shortly I will be bringing a committee from the Central Coast, including our local coroner, Bryan Wilson, and Mr Trezise and a number of other leading people in the field, to meet Dr Wooldridge to put forward our ideas and our views on tackling this problem again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have waited a number of weeks to be able to make my comments on this report. It is an excellent report. I know that the government has acted on some of the recommendations and certainly will be acting on more of them. I commend the report to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs report on the seminar into aspects of youth suicide, I would firstly add my words of commendation on the deductions of the report. It is a useful document and the recommendations are of value.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like also to express a personal appreciation to those people who took part in it. The seminar presenters were diverse and well informed, and they brought forward information, ideas and experiences which were quite valuable. I think that, for those who were not aware of this problem, the day was a useful exercise in encapsulating some of the issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say `some' of the issues because there is a very real danger that we start to treat suicide as a kind of disease that is preventable&mdash;that we actually look at some ways of inoculating people or perhaps immunising them against suicide. There is a real danger that we see it as being something in isolation. In that context, I want to make some comments about some of the issues that are involved in youth suicide, and in suicide in general, so we are dealing with the person in a holistic way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the seminar and in other forums it has become clear that suicide seems to be a person's statement that their life has no further meaning; there is no further point. For one reason or another, an individual decides that there is no longer a meaningful place for them here on this earth, amongst the people that they have normally been amongst. How those decisions are made and in what context varies enormously, and there is a very great danger that, because we use the same word, we tend to group them as having similar reasons and similar backgrounds. The fact is that they do not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we look at, for example, sexuality amongst young males, particularly in remote and rural areas, we find that, as we discovered in our parliamentary inquiry into aspects of youth homelessness and from talking to some people in the gay and lesbian community, there is an enormous pressure there, particularly on young men who perhaps conclude that they may have a sexual preference which is not normal in their context and their environment and are 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10417"> therefore alienated. Many of those young men end up in cities and end up suiciding, one way or another.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to understand that, when a society goes through the kind of changes that we are going through in terms of family breakdowns, there may well be casualties. And the casualties may well be young people who no longer have either a place in the world or a family. In our report on youth homelessness tabled in the previous parliament, we pointed out that some 60 per cent of young people on youth homeless allowance came from single or blended families. In other words, almost two out of three people who were claiming that allowance were from a family that had broken down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time, we have been watching with great alarm the massive increase in abuse of young people. One can argue about whether we are getting more reporting and whether or not the actual incidence of abuse has changed a lot, because in past years child abuse was not reported in the same way and was not investigated. But the fact is that, since it has been reported and since it has been mandatory, the numbers are increasing every year in a way that is truly alarming. If there is an epidemic in our society, the epidemic is more likely to be child abuse than suicide. Looking at those young people who do suicide and those young people who are homeless, one finds that the incidence of abuse appears to be very high.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that we have something like 30,000 confirmed cases of abuse of our young people per year should be a cause of enormous distress to us&mdash;as should be the fact that so many people who are committing abuse are not charged or in any way penalised for it. It is not simply paedophilia, currently in the public eye, but all abuse that is much worse. The effect of it in demeaning, demoralising and, in fact, eventually destroying so many young Australians must not be underestimated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Suicide is not necessarily a self&hyphen;generated conclusion. In so many cases it is generated by what is done to one, and the effect of the loss of esteem, confidence and sense of self that is brought about by acts of abuse on young people is, to my mind, a vast and unrecognised dark side of our society. As I said, every year the figures come out and they increase year after year. I suppose that those of us who watch that and are concerned about that would recognise the difficulty of definition. We recognise all those complications, but the facts are inescapable: there is a major problem in our society with young people being treated as objects that are able to be abused.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the report that we dealt with in 1995, after a very extensive range of inquiries around the country and submissions and a whole range of discussions, I was disturbed&mdash;and I still am disturbed&mdash;that so many parliamentarians were in fact blaming young people. The difficulty of determining homelessness and abuse is profound, but the risks are so great that most people working in the field tend to take the view that you give the first credibility to the young people themselves. All the evidence would indicate that in the vast majority of cases that is correct. I was therefore somewhat dismayed back in 1995 when members of the now government actually questioned that and actually made the claim in their minority report that they had reservations about the claims for homelessness. In fact they had the idea, which is still current, that our young people fabricate claims for the homelessness allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that we are getting 30,000 cases of abuse per year should be grounds enough for every one of us to overcompensate and to be, if you like, totally alert to it. But the fact is that two current ministers and a number of other present government members were, in the previous parliament, saying two things. They were saying, firstly, that they had reservations about the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10418"> bona fides of claimants; and their second point was, effectively, compulsory mediation. In other words, we should make the young person and the parent, who may well be a step&hyphen;parent, engage in a process of mediation which would in fact expose the young person to having to confront the person that they were accusing or the person that in many cases was abusing. Of course, what that means is very simple: young people do not report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The whole message there was that the parent was always right. That is still the message. They have translated from opposition into government and have kept the message running, and I think that should be of concern. So, for those people in the government now who are concerned about suicide, I would put it to you that it does not come about by accident; it does not happen as a one&hyphen;off thing. In so many cases, it is an end result of something else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another ingredient involved is the question of mental health&mdash;and, again, during that inquiry we were alarmed at the evidence brought forward of the incidence of mental health problems amongst our young. The fact is that about 50 per cent of all severe psychiatric illnesses are diagnosed by the age of 19 and the median age for half of our mental disorders is 16; yet, when you look at the expenditure on mental health, you will find that the vast bulk of it&mdash;something like 93 per cent of it&mdash;is on adults. In other words, we have a serious problem with the numbers of young people with mental health problems who are not being serviced, who are not getting the attention and support they need. Closely associated&mdash;and, in many cases, linked&mdash;with that are the problems of drug and alcohol abuse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I am trying to suggest is that suicide, particularly youth suicide, is often a matter of their total environment&mdash;of their background, of family disruption, of abuse, and eventually the question of identity, esteem and optimism. Abuse and family breakdowns often destroy the identity. Equally, they destroy the esteem. Optimism is another factor in the sense that other matters impact on that. Confidence in one's capacity to play a meaningful role, confidence in one's capacity to have a meaningful relationship, confidence to be a successful parent themselves, in so many young people is lacking. That comes back to the question of economics. Our young people, together with the majority of our older people, see governments and parliamentarians as being preoccupied with economics and not the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The famous Thatcher statement `There are no communities, just individuals' echoes very strongly in this situation. If you are the individual that she spoke of and you have been a victim of abuse or of family breakdown, if you are not that clever and not that well educated,  then do you exist? The idea that you exist by yourself has been one of the most damaging and destructive elements in our sociological development this century. The fact is that youth suicide is in proportions which should alarm us. However, as I said at the start, we should not see it as a disease in isolation that we cannot prevent. We really must see it as part of something else. Unless we get to the real symptoms and treat them and address them, all the rest is rhetoric and posturing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I encourage those in the government who have not read the report on youth homelessness to read it because what we uncovered in that report, as did Brian Burdekin, was a sickness in our society of serious proportions. The victims of that sickness were not the adults; they were the young. In many cases those young people survived, and some heroically.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I met a young woman who was 14&half; and she had been a prostitute for a year, since she was 13&half;. I met another young woman who was a graduate of a university. She had left school at 14 and been a prostitute at 14, but she had come through all that and got educated and gained 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10419"> a degree. There were enormously heroic stories. I also met some people who I do not think are alive any more. I met a young man in a squat who is now dead, who suicided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When one looks at that evidence there is not much point in coming to the end of the thing and saying, `How can we prevent youth suicide?' because the forces have been laid down in many cases five, 10 or 15 years before, and no-one gave a damn. Maybe they had told somebody but no&hyphen;one cared, or they were not believed. There were so many cases where young people were sent back to abusive households. There were so many cases where mothers had to choose between their daughters and their then husband or partner. There were so many cases where no-one seemed to give a damn, and the end result is we all get worried about youth suicide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we do not start worrying a lot sooner and believing these people a lot earlier and understanding them a lot better, we will see a lot more suicides, not fewer suicides. No amount of strategies in documenting, in isolating, in having help lines or anything else, will assist&mdash; because they are all treating the symptoms when we have to treat the cause. We have to get back to understanding what is happening to our young people at an earlier stage, not when they are teenagers. In many cases the causes arise when they are four or five or six or eight years of age.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee's report is of value to the parliament and the community. It is of even more value when it is linked with its previous report on youth homelessness. I would urge all parliamentarians to look much more closely at not just the issue of suicide but youth trauma, youth development and the family frameworks in which they grow up.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am speaking on this occasion about the summary report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Aspects of youth suicide</EMPHASIS> . I intend to address the extraordinarily high representation that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians make in the national statistics. I do this not to downplay the human tragedy of non&hyphen;ATSI suicide but to highlight the difference between the ATSI and non&hyphen;ATSI experience of youth suicide, which should give some indication of how our best efforts might be better directed in combating suicide in an approach which will recognise the uniqueness of ATSI suicide and self&hyphen;harm.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An indictment of the seriousness of youth suicide is evident in one of the ATSI communities in my electorate which, sadly, currently holds the unfortunate reputation of having the largest number of youth suicides in the country and one of the largest in the world. Standing almost as a monument, and an ongoing reminder to the tragedy of the children in this community, is a tree known locally as the hanging tree which, to date, has provided a means to suicide for 20 young people in that community&mdash;a frightening statistic by anybody's reckoning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The summary report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Aspects of youth suicide</EMPHASIS> points to factors such as age, family separation history, geographic isolation, unemployment, and drug and alcohol use. If these are important factors in increases in suicide amongst Australians, then it would seem that they would be more relevant to ATSI Australians, and I shall address these individually. Suicide rates amongst white Australians remain fairly constant at around 15 to 20 cases per 100,000 Australians from the age of 16 to 75&hyphen;plus. ATSI suicide, on the other hand, is a problem that is particularly a youth related one. Suicide rates amongst black Australians can be measured in significant numbers from an earlier age of 13. The number rises dramatically to nearly double that of non&hyphen;ATSI suicide by early adulthood. By mid&hyphen;adulthood, the rate drops by two-thirds and, surprisingly, further reduces to insignificant numbers by the age of 55.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10420">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The trauma of divorce or parental separation is a factor in many youth suicides. I guess the official state sanction of family separation would surely have had a greatly increased result, one would imagine. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bringing them home</EMPHASIS> report demonstrated the dramatic effects that this had on the lives of those that the family separation policy touched. The ratio of urban to non&hyphen;urban ATSI Australians is roughly 70 to 30 whereas the reverse is the case for non&hyphen;ATSI Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those in remote and rural areas do not only suffer from a lack of the many crisis support systems available for those in urban areas but they also suffer, as all members of regional electorates know well, worse standards in terms of infrastructure and opportunity. ATSI unemployment stands at four times the national average, at about 40 per cent. According to leading experts on ATSI suicide in Australia and to the author of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Aboriginal health and history</EMPHASIS>, Professor Ernest Hunter, drug use and alcoholism appear to be the most significant immediate causes of suicide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Professor Hunter heads an excellent team of academics with social and preventative medicine based in Cairns in my electorate. The work of this unit is well regarded nationally through its hands&hyphen;on approach with the larger ATSI population centres improving ATSI health outcomes. Professor Hunter claimed a significant victory recently for Far North Queensland to lead the way in research and training to solve chronic problems facing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health, when a $1.5 million funding allocation to establish a centre of excellence in ATSI health was awarded to a joint submission of the University of Queensland and the Queensland University of Technology, which will conduct much of its work through the social and preventative medicine units in Cairns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to Professor Hunter, increased vulnerability to suicide was first experienced by young Aboriginal males passing into and through adolescence in the late 1980s. As suicide is an end point&mdash;as are also increasing rates of alcohol abuse, self&hyphen;mutilation, child abuse and domestic violence&mdash;much can be learnt by exploring the background factors rather than seeking a cause in the immediate circumstances. We should look at the situation for Aboriginal Australians reaching maturity in the 1980s, which was shaped by the experience of those young adults who were having children through the 1970s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a period of tumultuous change, with significant consequences for social roles within Aboriginal Australia. A generation who were young adults at the time of the Commonwealth referendum experienced entry into a cash economy, with unemployment and welfare dependence and increasing access to alcohol, following the legislation of its sale to Aboriginal Australians. Circumstances of continuing social disadvantage and binge drinking provided a context in which the impulsive, aggressive expression of tension resulted in escalating interpersonal violence. This proposition of increasing violence is supported by statistics showing an increase in suicide by violent means. Research by Harrison and Moller conducted in 1994 showed that 93 per cent of Aboriginal suicides resulted from hanging or firearms, compared with 43 per cent of non&hyphen;Aboriginal deaths, a comparison not shown in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Aspects of youth suicide</EMPHASIS> summary report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Institute of Suicide Research and Prevention report to the Commonwealth last year showed that those means are also the most lethal. Given the availability of means, with guns being readily available in remote areas and rural settings&mdash;and hanging being a matter of opportunity rather than means&mdash;and the connection with alcohol, the impulsivity is particularly important.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10421">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Research conducted by Professor Hunter and others for the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre in Sydney revealed that impulses to self harm and suicide were widely experienced by ATSIC informants, with a moderate association to drinking status. However, acting on those impulses was strongly associated with alcohol, and it was the quantity consumed per drinking occasion rather than the frequency of consumption that predicted past self&hyphen;harmful or suicidal acts. Rather than being causal in an absolute sense, alcohol appears to enable the acting out of simmering impulses that may be otherwise better coped with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sadly, of a more sinister nature, an area of concern is the sexual abuse of children, a contributing factor no doubt to youth suicide. Unfortunately, this is very prolific in some ATSI communities. Reports that I have received in my office would certainly appear to confirm this. A recorded high incidence of sexually transmitted diseases, particularly in very young children, in some of the communities undoubtedly confirms this factor. I have had evidence received in my office of children as young as six and seven with very serious advanced forms of sexual disease. Clearly, this is a major factor with regard to the well&hyphen;being of that child. I feel that this is an area that really needs to be explored a lot more and to be dealt with very firmly and harshly if we have any way of being able to give those kids any sort of future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, it is because it is of a very sensitive nature that the issue tends to be swept under the carpet. Unless it is addressed in a more open forum, along with the other contributing factors like substance abuse and unemployment, the issue of youth suicide will never ever be resolved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirty years after the Commonwealth referendum, the tensions experienced by young adult Aborigines in relation to the wider society are probably greater than those experienced by their parents at a similar age. We are now at an historic point with the ability to accept these facts and seriously address them. The acceptance by the government of this report gives the opportunity for experts in the field to have a direct line of communication with the highest levels of the decision&hyphen;making process. With this prospect, I certainly commend the report to the House with two qualifications. Firstly, I would be greatly concerned should the priority 3 recommendation that an immediate review of current funding and redirection of some funds to a more appropriate and better targeted program lead to a reduction of the level of funding for ATSI suicide prevention, which currently stands at $1.058 million out of a $32 million budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, I support the recommendation of the report that a national advisory council be established to provide strategic advice to the minister and government on youth suicide  prevention and related matters. But I would recommend that this council must contain an expert on ATSI suicide, given the uniqueness of the ATSI situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Youth suicide is certainly a blight on our society&mdash;a cancer, if you like&mdash;and it is clear that it crosses all cultural boundaries. Our youth are our future and it is essential that we as a society do all in our power to address this tragedy. I will, of course, continue to fully support all efforts and initiatives in this regard.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to also address the topic which has become so significant. There are very few communities that have not come to grips with the devastation of youth suicide. The incidence of suicide has now reached most unacceptable levels, particularly in regional areas and particularly with respect to males.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the increase in the rate of suicide in cities should not be minimised. According to a recent publication from the Australian Institute for Suicide Research and Prevention, there 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10422"> are upwards of 2,500 deaths recorded as suicide each year. Queensland and Tasmania have the highest incidences of suicides. A report recently released by the Queensland government indeed confirms this very sad fact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, even more disturbing is that for every successful suicide there are up to 300 female and 50 male unsuccessful attempts. In my own electorate of Petrie, as indeed in Australia, there are families who have known the pain and suffering of having someone close to them commit suicide. Recently, I hosted a breakfast in Margate, which Professor Baume and the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) convened. Over 100 people attended this breakfast. It was particularly sad at the end of the breakfast when I was speaking to a number of people who had been touched by this particular problem. A mother in tears approached me. She was absolutely devastated by the death of her son 12 months previously. She was still in a period of denial and did not understand why he had taken his life. But she felt reassured by coming along to the breakfast and she thanked me enormously for organising the breakfast. It gave her great comfort and reassurance that there was nothing that she could have done and no way that she could have predicted that he would take his life. I was able to then put her in touch with a support group of parents who are able to meet on a regular basis and discuss the issues of youth suicide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most tragic thing is that the people who are left behind are the ones that suffer for many years afterwards not knowing if there was something that they somehow could have done to prevent their young ones taking their lives. It is the not knowing that haunts them for the rest of their lives. It is important to emphasise that this touches everyone from family to friends. Quite often, the friends that are left in their wake and their family are the ones that really do need the help the most.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it is an issue that does affect the lives of families, not only in the Redcliffe areas I have mentioned, in Deception Bay, but throughout Australia. We cannot ignore it as a community and we cannot really take it very lightly. We have a responsibility as a community not to trivialise this or ignore it, because it has very great social ramifications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an issue that we see quite a lot. We see it in the media, in programs like <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS>, and in publications. We even have the misfortune now to see it on the Internet. On one occasion, I heard Professor Baume speak of the role of the Internet and what young people use it for these days. They use it as a forum to communicate with each other on suitable and appropriate measures of suicide and they actually give each other tips on the most effective ways to commit suicide. It is disturbing to see that. There are thousands of hit sites on the  Internet that deal with this. It is quite a blight on our society that the Internet is being used by young people to communicate these things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As with any tragic death, the ramifications of suicide are very widespread but, unlike other tragic deaths, suicide brings with it great sadness, disbelief and guilt. As I mentioned, family and friends are the ones who find it very hard to understand. Like ripples in a pond, these deaths, by their very nature, cannot fail to affect everyone in the community. One thing I have noticed is that, if there are cases of suicide in families, it tends to be an intergenerational thing. There are certainly issues that never get resolved in the first place. It gets buried away under the carpet or in the cupboard. People do not speak about it, and intergenerational suicide is a very common thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should really look at it very closely. We should be tireless in our efforts to find solutions because there is such despair and hopelessness among our young people. The member for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10423"> Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) highlighted some terrible cases that he has come across. He touched me deeply when he spoke about the young women who had been to see him and the terrible cases of suicide. But young people can overcome some of these things. He spoke of some very positive instances where young women were prostitutes and were contemplating suicide but they were able to rebuild their lives and attend university and look forward to the future. He was right that we need to emphasise the youth aspects of it&mdash;the trauma and youth development&mdash;and I think that is very important to acknowledge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have spoken on this topic on many occasions and today I would like to acknowledge the efforts of the House, particularly the previous chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs in producing the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Aspects of youth suicide</EMPHASIS>. The report followed a very successful seminar that was held here earlier this year. I was not a member of the committee but I did gain quite a lot from attending on that particular day. The speakers were top rate and, as I mentioned, I have since had contact with one of the speakers, Associate Professor Pierre Baume. He has made a number of contributions in this area. It is an area that he has studied for a number of years. His extensive research has tended to emphasise the sociological factors that contribute to youth suicide. He believes that these can be divided into categories: the global aspects and the personal aspects. He mentioned a number of things, and a number of speakers have highlighted them&mdash;for instance, the high divorce rate. One cannot underestimate the effect of divorce. It is a devastating thing. What is more devastating, when people do split up, is that children sometimes feel that they are the direct cause of it. It is never talked through with young children, and it is not explained that they are not really the central issue in a divorce.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other areas were high youth and high female unemployment. Alcohol consumption, as the member for Leichhardt (Mr Entsch) mentioned, is clearly a big problem. A number of speakers have raised the issue of unwanted pregnancies and the devastation this can have on people's lives not just in the immediate present but also well into the future. There is a trend these days not to attend church and not to be community or religion focused. One cannot underestimate the importance of those factors&mdash;when people have no-one to talk to&mdash;and having community support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some other facts that I would like to highlight, that come up frequently. The member for Leichhardt mentioned the rate of Aboriginal deaths by suicide. It is an area of grave concern. It is four times the rate of non-Aboriginals in Queensland. As I mentioned, for  every suicide, there are a number of suicides that are attempted&mdash;and these are 100 times greater.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also the fact that there is a larger number of men who commit suicide than females. Blood alcohol levels and alcohol addictions clearly have a strong correlation with suicidal behaviour, particularly when you talk about binge drinking, which tends to occur mainly in summer. That was something that was highlighted at the recent breakfast that I hosted. These particular bouts of binge drinking occur in summer, and the rates of suicide are higher in summer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Professor Baume mentioned that we needed to put more preventive measures in place. But then he highlighted that we need to be particularly concerned&mdash;and he quoted studies that go back 30 or so years&mdash;because sometimes if you do put in too many prevention measures, or not the right prevention measures, suicide rates actually go up in schools where they have had prevention measures. He emphasised that there was a greater need to put these measures in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10424"> place when people reach young adulthood, rather than at schools. That was quite an interesting revelation. I was quite amazed when he made that particular revelation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The main problems are definitely in the relationship area. I feel that young men do not mature as quickly as young women. Most of the problems are on a very personal level and they compound the situation. Things like the loss or death of a family friend, as I have mentioned, and break&hyphen;up of relationships clearly come into the equation, particularly with young males when they are not able to deal with the sense of rejection and loss. We need to spend a lot more money on relationship counselling and dealing with those sorts of issues as well because they are clearly a problem when people are not able to deal with the break&hyphen;up of a relationship or with grief issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The importance of these factors is seen in the results of a youth forum in my area, in Redcliffe. Those forums will be continuing. Whilst forums like these are very important to identify problems and suggest solutions, it is important that all levels in the community combine and cooperate to follow through in working out strategies and implementing programs to help realise these solutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The federal government has taken some steps, and they are to be commended, particularly in respect to the youth suicide issue. Upwards of $31 million is being spent on the national youth suicide prevention strategy, and they are very real and positive steps. Also, there is a provision of $6 million to states and territories to improve access in rural and remote areas to counselling; $6 million is being committed to Lifeline and Kids Helpline; and $3 million is being provided for programs for parents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And let's not underestimate the benefit of parents. We all take an individual responsibility when we have children to ensure that they are brought up in the correct manner as far as their physical needs are concerned and their schooling. But psychological nurturing and self&hyphen;esteem are just as important. I know that negativity can be one of the greatest downfalls of any young person. We do need to nurture and look after our young people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All the research that I have seen on overseas countries and the incidence of suicide&mdash;and, clearly, Australia and New Zealand seem to have the highest rates in the industrialised world&mdash;point to the factor of cultural and family influence. It is no coincidence when you see European countries with lower levels of youth suicide. One has to detect from that: is the family environment such that it does not encourage suicide? What is being done culturally in these countries that prevents suicide? Is it a stronger family situation? Is it the role of the  extended family? We cannot underestimate how important family influences and upbringing are in this particular issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) best summed it up in June this year, when she launched the national youth suicide program, when she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When so many of our young people are dying by their own hand through despair, desperation, frustration, or loneliness, it is a problem that demands national attention and national action.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The recommendations of the committee's report are that developments in the effective service delivery of these programs and strategies will be based on positive and up&hyphen;to&hyphen;date information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The integration of suicide research is needed to ensure that grants are used effectively. There has to be some sort of consistency and accuracy in data collection in Australia. It is very disturbing when you see that there is no national database for suicide, and that the statistics are very sketchily collected and are very ad hoc. We really need to look at focusing on that. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10425"> If we know the extent of the problem that we are dealing with, we can deal with it much more effectively. I emphasise the need for greater research and figures in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The federal government has shown that it is prepared to support and assist those who are at risk and are classified as prime candidates for youth suicide. The fact that the committee advocates the constant review of Australia's suicide strategy emphasises the fact that the strategies and funding policies need to be continually monitored, and updated if necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that it is important that the information be provided, that it is designed to assist families and those at risk, and that it needs to be as readily and widely available as possible. Doctors, teachers, counsellors, representatives at all levels of government, and particularly young people, should have access not only to this relevant information but also to the contact details. This is particularly important for families in crisis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The solution to youth suicide is very complex and very sensitive and this government has made, and will make, a significant effort to listen to and address the needs of that part of our community which right at this very minute is crying out in loneliness and desperation. I think that the most important step, the next step&mdash;prevention&mdash;is going to be very much harder, and we really do need to emphasise it.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The prioritising of complaints is done on a daily basis. In this regard, some complaints are more urgent than others. For example, cases which involve serious matters, or which are time&hyphen;critical involving executive action such as posting or discharge, are normally allocated the highest priority. Delays can occur when complaints are afforded a low priority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Delays can also occur in complex cases, where investigations may become lengthy and involved. In addition, in some cases, complainants delay their responses to requests for additional information which would enable their complaint to be progressed. Finally, some members are slow in providing advice as to whether they are satisfied with decisions made by their Chief of Service, or if they wish their complaint to be further considered by the Chief of the Defence Force. In a recent case, two years elapsed before an officer decided that he wished his complaint to be referred to the Chief of the Defence Force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In order to determine the reasons for the various delays in finalising individual applications for redress of grievance, a physical search of all redress of grievance files would be necessary. I am not prepared to commit further resources for this task.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some steps have been taken to improve the current processes for handling ADF members' redresses of grievance. On 1 July 1997, a combined Complaint Resolution Agency was created in the Defence Personnel Executive. A focus of the new Agency will be to establish, to the greatest extent possible, common procedures for the handling of complaints and to encourage the resolution of complaints at the lowest level. The integration and rationalisation of Service complaint management functions should lead to the more efficient handling of ADF members' complaints.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) There has been no change to the Commonwealth Government's requirements for quality assurance in Government tenders. The policy has always been to consider the need for quality assurance on a case by case basis, taking into account the risks associated with the provision and use of those purchases. This is clearly stated in the recently released Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Yes. In November 1996 the Commonwealth and Telstra entered into a Deed of Agreement under which Telstra would establish and operate a Commonwealth Electronic Commerce Service (CECS). CECS, now known as `Transigo', was to be funded on a user&hyphen;pays basis and implemented in a series of releases, offering progressively expanded functionality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first release of Transigo was made available in March 1997, with additional functionality added in a number of sub&hyphen;releases since then.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Commonwealth buyers use Transigo to advertise bidding opportunities and report their purchasing, while suppliers are able to access this information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Telstra has announced further developments of Transigo. An electronic trading document service will be available by December 1997 and an electronic payment service by March 1998.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Transigo is an Internet&hyphen;based service. It has a free&hyphen;to&hyphen;air component which provides basic access to summary information about Commonwealth business opportunities and contracts and standing offers arranged by the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Buyers and suppliers can also subscribe to Transigo for a basic annual subscription cost of $348 per user. This currently allows buyers to publish opportunities on Transigo and suppliers to download tender documentation and advertise their goods and services, with additional functionality to be provided in future releases. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) The impetus behind Transigo originated with the Commonwealth, and other tiers of government are being encouraged to use Transigo to conduct procurement. It is intended that Transigo will also become a medium for business&hyphen;to&hyphen;business transactions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Transigo provides links to state government Internet sites and information about their procurement policies and practices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) The development and implementation of Transigo is being undertaken by Telstra following an extensive tendering process. The terms of the contractual arrangements between the Commonwealth and Telstra are such that there are no payments by the Commonwealth to Telstra to establish the service. The project is being funded on a user&hyphen;pays basis through subscriptions to Transigo by buyers and suppliers.</PARA>
