<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Finance and Administration. Do you recall your previous commitment that any extra proceeds from the Telstra sale, over and above the amount originally estimated, will be used only to retire public debt? Will you reaffirm that that is still the government's position? Or are you now leaving open the option of applying those extra proceeds for such purposes as funding a retreat on your pharmaceutical benefits changes and a backdown on nursing home fees?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. I should say first and foremost that this is a government that is about reducing debt. Since coming to government and inheriting that $10.3 billion worth of deficit, we have sought to reduce that deficit, to go through a period of fiscal responsibility&mdash;something which Labor did not know about in the five years prior to the election in March of last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, first and foremost, we are not about increasing debt; we are not about increasing the spending of government; we are not about living beyond our means; we are very clearly about reducing the debt which Labor ran up&mdash;that $70 billion of additional debt over the five years prior to the election.</PARA>

<ANSWER PAGE="9346" SPEAKER="Smith, Warwick, MP" NAMEID="GJ4" ELECTORATE="Bass" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Minister for Family Services" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GJ4">Mr WARWICK SMITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Bradfield for his very well&hyphen;drafted question. It contained a lot of very useful information. I would like to take the opportunity to spell out a few facts about the accommodation bond, given that that has been the subject of some discussion publicly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What needs to be recognised at the outset is that there is a six-month period for people to pay those bonds under the Aged Care Act, and they cannot be required to pay earlier. It is as simple as that; there are six months before they have to pay. Also, providers who act outside that act are acting illegally, and the act can be used to full effect to address that particular matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other matter that the member raised was other methods by which people might meet their obligations under the proposed bond system. One is described as the periodic payment arrangements. The bond can be paid in a lump sum, as I have mentioned, or they can make an equivalent weekly or fortnightly periodic payment made up of the retention amount of $2,600 plus the component for interest. They can pay part as a lump sum or part as a periodic payment, whichever option suits them. This is a very flexible system. They can also, as the member indicated in his question&mdash;I can confirm that it is a fact&mdash;agree that the retention amount and the interest be taken from their estate, if that is what they want to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The important thing that has not been raised in this debate is that this is a system that is needs based, not means based. In other words, if someone needs to go into a hostel or a nursing home, they are assessed by an ACATS team, an aged care assessment team. If those assessments show that they should go into care, they go along to that home and seek an agreement with regard to the bond in the terms that I have just outlined. So there is no up-front fee, as has been stated by many in the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another point that I want to make. All the industry agreed with the following matter. There are provisions in the act under section 57(xii)&mdash;the shadow spokesman will be aware of this&mdash;that provides that the maximum accommodation bond that can be charged is lesser than the amount specified in the accommodation bond agreement, the amount such that it leaves the person with assets of $22,500 or an amount specified or worked out in accordance with the user rights principles. Therefore, it allows a cap to be set in the subordinate legislation. This could be 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9347"> either a fixed amount or use a schedule or formula to determine different limits for different circumstances. There is no limit at present. If a cap was to be provided, this could come into effect once they are signed and approved by the relevant minister.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is also addressed to the Minister for Family Services. Earlier today my office contacted your department in Sydney about the circumstances of two elderly women within my electorate who share a house. One may need to enter a nursing home. We inquired whether they would have to sell their home to raise the funds to enter into that nursing home. My office was advised that they would be required to sell the home unless they are a couple defined by the act. Minister, why do you allow this ridiculous anomaly to exist where my two elderly constituents have to pretend that they are lesbians to be exempted from selling their home?</PARA></TALK.START>

I am not quite sure what you expect me to say other than to say that the legislation does not make a sexual determination or suggest any sexual determination. I would personally reject it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Defence. Can the Minister for Defence inform the House what is being done to combat illegal fishing in the Heard and McDonald Islands exclusive economic zone?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="9347" SPEAKER="McLachlan, Ian, MP" NAMEID="HT4" ELECTORATE="Barker" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Defence" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HT4">Mr McLACHLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Swan for his question. I will give a straight answer to this question. The government has been concerned for some time about reports of illegal fishing in our exclusive economic zone around the Heard and McDonald Islands in the Southern Ocean. As we know, this illegal fishing breaches Australia's sovereign rights, is anti&hyphen;conservation, kills many seabirds and is not in the interests of our fishing industry. Last August cabinet directed that the Australian Defence Force mount an operation against this illegal fishing activity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last Thursday and Friday our newest frigate, HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Anzac</EMPHASIS>, apprehended two foreign vessels operating in the vicinity of that exclusive economic zone. The boats are the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Salvora</EMPHASIS>, registered in Belize, and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Aliza Glacial</EMPHASIS>, registered in Panama. As I speak, they are being escorted to Fremantle and to an appearance for their masters in an Australian court. The masters of both these 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9348"> vessels can be charged under the Fisheries Management Act. The penalties for illegal foreign fishing can include fines of up to $250,000 and forfeiture of the vessels, gear and the catch.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say that the operation has been an outstanding success for the Defence Force and, once again, shows their very high level of morale and professionalism and training. They are working in very hazardous conditions down there in subantarctic waters. Just for the interest of members, it is 1&half; times further south than the area where we rescued Tony Bullimore and Monsieur Dubois last year. In other words, it is about 4,000 kilometres south of Perth. Despite these difficulties, it is just business as usual&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question and his interest. In March this year I informed the House about the national Aboriginal and Islander sexual health strategy, something that we had worked for a year with to get consensus amongst Aboriginal groups as to a way we could move forward in this very difficult area. Since then we have utilised the framework agreements that we have signed with states. That means that for the first time we have had the state governments, ATSIC, Aboriginal community controlled organisations and the Commonwealth government sitting down together trying to work out a common strategy. We have worked on the basis of what underpins the sexual health strategy&mdash;that is, quality primary health care and a population approach to sexual health, which is a very big change from what has been tried in the past, which is stand&hyphen;alone education.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to inform the House that the first agreement has been reached with the Queensland state government whereby we will be contributing $1.8 million over the next 12 months to programs in four main areas. The first is that we will be funding externally funded agencies. The second is that we will be providing clinical services in six deed of grant communities. The third is that we will be providing 12 community sexual health programs. Finally, we will be doing a well 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9352"> person screening program, and this is very exciting. It is essentially a joint venture between the Queensland government and non&hyphen;government agencies, in particular Apunipima Aboriginal health service based at Cairns, in the member for Leichhardt's electorate. The director of this is Barbara Flick, who is known to many people in the House who have an interest in Aboriginal health matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is terribly exciting. It draws on the experience of the tri&hyphen;state project which ran in the Northern Territory&hyphen;South Australian&hyphen;WA border area. Kerry Arabena, who was the coordinator of that, has moved to Cairns and it is actually her leadership and vision that has got this up and running. What is going to happen is that we will focus on a population basis to try to get rid of some of the large residual population of untreated and asymptomatic sexually transmitted diseases that in the end make this area so difficult to address. Because there is obviously difficulty and some stigma associated with it, the screening will not just be for sexually transmitted diseases but will also involve diabetes, liver disease and heart disease.</PARA>

It was agreed, in conjunction with the industry and consumer groups, that the level of the bond would not be capped. The act provides, and I have

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Moreton for his question and acknowledge the great interest he has in foreign affairs issues, including Australia's development assistance program. As I think the House knows, the primary purpose of Australia's foreign aid budget is to assist developing countries, particularly those in the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region, to reduce poverty and improve standards of living through sustainable development.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now that we are halfway through the life of this parliament, we look to see the development of policies of the Australian Labor Party. And imagine my pleasure when I saw on Monday morning an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper headed `ALP won't trade on foreign aid spending'&mdash;an article reporting the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith's policy position on Australia's aid program. There was a good point in the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith's policy. That was that the Labor Party has apparently endorsed the government's priorities in terms of the development assistance program. But I also noticed with interest that the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith, in developing Labor's policies, has identified the fact that Labor would reach 0.4 per cent of GNP aid spending by the year 2005.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That may be all very well but, when you are a major political party and when you are the opposition, you also have to explain to the Australian people not just what your target is but how you are going to reach your target and how you are going to pay for it. The question on our lips is: `How is the Labor Party going to pay for this?' To achieve that target, I am advised, they would have to raise somewhere in the vicinity of $7 billion by 2005.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You can come to one of two conclusions. If they are going to spend an additional $7 billion, where are they going to get the money from? Are they going to cut the money from schools? Are they going to cut the money from hospital funding? Or is it going to come from nursing home capital programs? The point is that, if you put forward a policy like 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this, you ought to have the decency to tell the Australian people how you are going to pay for the policy. You have said absolutely nothing about that, which leads one to draw the reasonable conclusion that this policy is nothing more than a repetition of the deceit we had during the last election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members may recall that in February 1996 the now Deputy Leader of the Opposition went around claiming that Labor would absolutely increase aid to 0.4 per cent of GNP. This was an absolutely firm commitment&mdash;until we pointed out that it would cost you in those days $1.2 billion to do it. You had a hole in your budget and four days later&mdash;I think it was&mdash;you made another statement to the effect, `Oh well, that's our aspiration; I'm not sure whether we would ever reach it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those with an even longer memory, let me tell them that in 1993 John Kerin, as the Minister for Development Assistance in those days, said that during `the life of the next parliament'&mdash;the 1993&hyphen;96 parliament&mdash;`Labor would increase aid spending up to 0.4 per cent of GNP'. That is what he said. And what happened? It went from 0.36 per cent down to 0.33 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we have had deceit from the Labor Party in the 1993 election and the 1996 election. When it comes to the 1998 or 1999 election, let us see where you are going to get the money from. Explain that to the Australian public, because the fact is that we are past the mid&hyphen;point of this parliament now and it is incumbent on the Labor Party not just to stand up here and ask questions about existing government policies but to explain how you will pay for all the things you claim you would do.

<ANSWER PAGE="9354" SPEAKER="Costello, Peter, MP" NAMEID="CT4" ELECTORATE="Higgins" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Treasurer" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CT4">Mr COSTELLO</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The current wholesale sales tax system discriminates against manufacturers. That is one of the reasons why this government is engaged in tax reform. When the wholesale sales tax system was introduced in the 1930s, goods were the predominant part of the Australian economy, but they are no longer. As a result, it is the manufactured sector of the Australian economy which is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9355"> increasingly bearing the burden of the indirect tax system in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you wanted to design a tax which discriminated against manufacturers in this country you would be hard put to find a more discriminatory tax than the wholesale sales tax system. The point is that there is one side of Australian politics that wants to help manufacturers by improving the Australian taxation system: it is the coalition side. The Labor Party has no interest whatsoever in dealing with the real problems of the Australian taxation system. No other developed country&mdash;and only half a dozen in the world, including Botswana, Pakistan, Swaziland and the Solomon Islands&mdash;still has a wholesale sales tax. The countries that still have one all supplement it with a retail service tax, and about half of those are intending to move to a VAT style broad based tax on goods and services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The wholesale sales tax is a cascading tax. It cascades on business inputs, and it is not totally cashed out in respect of exports, putting a surcharge on exports of manufactures in this country. Who would stand up and say that it is a fair thing that our manufacturers who are exporting have this tax imposed on their exports? The Labor Party. There is one party in Australian politics that believes in unfair and discriminatory taxes, and it is the Labor Party. They believe that a tax system which was introduced in 1930 is the kind of tax system we should have for the 21st century. Who would believe that after 80 years we should not be improving the tax system? The Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Foreign Affairs has already detailed how the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith has got Labor out for an unfunded promise of $7 billion.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, absent again. She was asking questions about this subject and in fact made allegations in the House that Brazilian citrus juice was being labelled `made in Australia'. The fact is that fruit growers have a right to be concerned when these sorts of claims are being made. Australian citrus juice has an enviable reputation for its quality, and Australian growers naturally want to ensure that the integrity of claims for Australian origin are protected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many Australian consumers are prepared to pay a premium to buy an Australian product, so claims that juice is Australian when in fact it is Brazilian or from some other country can damage the public confidence in the labelling system. Origin labelling claims such as `made in Australia' and `product of Australia' are regulated at the Commonwealth level under the Trade Practices Act. The relevant provisions of that act make it abundantly clear that fruit juice that is merely reconstituted or packaged in Australia from Brazilian orange juice cannot carry such descriptors as `made in Australia' or `product of Australia'. Such claims would be a clear breach of the act. A product manufactured in Australia from imported ingredients would have to have some kind of qualified claim, such as `made in Australia with imported concentrate'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a very active regulator, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, that has given a high priority to policing country of origin labelling claims. There have been a number of actions in relation to false labelling claims but not very many, I might add, in relation to country of origin. There was one recent case in relation to Florida foods in Sydney, but in that case the claims that were false on the label were multiple. There were claims that it was unsweetened when in fact it was sweetened, that it was fresh when it was not fresh and that it was Australian when there is strong evidence that some of the concentrate was imported. So there have been actions taken whenever evidence has been brought to the attention of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the ACCC or the government that a false claim has been made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should also point out that the ACCC, along with the Australian Fruit Juice Association, has produced a code of practice aimed at preventing misleading practices in the industry. An industry complaints body determines the most appropriate sanction when a breach occurs. Of course, the ACCC can also act if there is a need for enforcement action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Mallee is as well aware as many others that this government inherited a product labelling system that was seriously flawed. We are acting to restore the integrity of the system. If anyone has a particular concern that a product is falsely labelled as Australian when it is imported then we want to know about it. If the member for Oxley can substantiate her claims that Brazilian orange juice is being labelled as Australian, we want to know about it and we will take action. If she cannot substantiate her claims then she should not seek to damage the confidence of the Australian people in the Australian fruit juice industry. This government is determined to ensure that consumers are told the truth about the origin of fruit juice and the Australian citrus industry can be assured of our determination to act in the area.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That this House censures the Government for forcing elderly Australians to sell the family home for what is a form of health care traditionally provided by the whole community for those who need to enter a nursing home.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What we have seen today from the new Minister for Family Services (Mr Warwick Smith) is a small soupcon of a problem that has been confronted by elderly people all over Australia today as they confront this new uncertainty in their lives. There is, in Centrelink now, an overload of people unable to answer inquiries on the detail of this&mdash;issues that they desperately need to comprehend.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a minister wandering around, with a backbench having heart failure when they confront these particular issues&mdash;a backbench who understandably are deeply concerned, a backbench who, as one particular member from Western Australia has pointed out, have received something like 100 telephone calls in the last couple of days&mdash;and this minister does not comprehend a fundamental aspect of this policy which goes to the heart of the motive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The way in which the government like to clothe themselves here in this chamber is that they have found a brilliant way in which to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> fund nursing homes in this country&mdash;a fair way, an equitable way, a non-confiscatory way. They criticised the previous government for rebasing aged care, and massively expanding expenditure on aged care. This was because we pursued a policy to, as far as possible, keep people in their houses as long as possible and provide a whole variety of alternative services&mdash;and, in the process, in the course of a decade, in that period of time doubling expenditure on aged care. They have sought to demonise that particular policy, say it was inadequate, and then assume that we will not actually read their budget papers to see precisely what they are up to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday we had this minister up here, with his little chart, saying, `This is where there's been a decline thus far in expenditure under the previous government,' as far as funding for nursing home capital provision was concerned. Yesterday he was up there doing that particular exercise and he was caught out, because he stood in ignorance of the fact that some $300 million specifically in nursing home capital funds was boastfully extracted from the budget&mdash;indeed, the Treasurer (Mr Costello) thought it good enough to mention in his speech&mdash;and the burden of care placed directly on the people who were entering nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister stood in ignorance of that yesterday. Then today he had the hide to get up in this place and pretend in his first answer&mdash;until finally, over three questions, we beat him down to what the actual reality is. We finally beat him down to that position; he finally admitted, `Yes, not one red cent of this increased fee that is coming in on 1 November is, in fact, going to go to additional provision for nursing homes'&mdash;not one red cent. That is a direct take out of patients in nursing homes put in the bank&hyphen;kick of the government. That is precisely what the intention of that policy was.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Gradually, slowly, we ground this minister down into admitting what is the reality of this policy. The reality of this policy is to shift the entirety, the massive predominance, of the burden, as far as the capital provision of nursing homes is concerned, onto Australians who are most vulnerable.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9359">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this government has tried to do, as it has gone down this road, is to clothe itself with some sort of protection via what was done in hostels by the previous government. Let me get on to the difference between hostels and nursing homes because, while 100 per cent of Australians outside this chamber understand the difference between hostels and nursing homes, only one-third of the Australians inside this chamber understand that difference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But let us tell you what we did. It is true that in the area of hostels we did bring into place a means tested provision for those who were entering those hostels; at the same time, we massively increased public funding for hostels. So for people who needed to access it, because they were in a situation where they could not afford it, the government was putting money towards their position. On top of that, there was an additional provision associated with hostels that was a means tested co-payment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what did this government do? It went in the opposite direction. Not only did it put in place a proposition, as far as nursing homes were concerned, which would strip those entering them of their assets down to $22,500; it also extracted all the public funding associated with capital provision for nursing homes. That is what this government did. To clothe yourselves even with one iota of protection from what the previous government did, in pursuing a massively generous policy to aged care assistance, with this little piece of chicanery is simply adding a personal disgrace to your public disgrace as far as this issue of nursing homes is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me go through the difference between hostels and nursing homes for that exclusive little group immediately opposite us which needs an explanation&mdash;and I apologise to the gallery for boring them to tears while I go through this process. To compare a hostel with a nursing home is like saying that a hotel is the same as a hospital because there are beds in it. That is the relevance of the comparison. The simple fact of the matter is that nursing homes now, and nursing homes increasingly, are occupied exclusively by the most frail and ill amongst the aged. If they 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> are in that situation, they are not in hostels. Only if they happen to be in that situation of extremity now do they get into nursing homes.</PARA>

You, of course, in this budget, I might say, have cut that, against your particular election promises. But we massively increased home and community care. We acknowledged that people, aside from what they might do in their own homes, were also moving into different styles of living, and that hostels were becoming less relevant for large numbers of them. Nevertheless, we increased provision for accommodation in hostels, we increased support for hostels, while we were in office so that people would be able to take those choices.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We acknowledged that, as we did all of these things, increasingly nursing homes were going to find themselves bearing the burden of the frailest and the most vulnerable in our society. That is why we treat them differently. That is why in opposition we treat them differently, and that is why when we return to government we will treat them differently.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Treasurer decided to mock what we would do. What has this particular piece of chicanery against the elderly in our community produced? It has contributed to a surplus that is now openly touted around the Liberal Party as a slush fund for their next election campaign. In order to introduce their value added tax, the GST, they are openly meandering around the place saying, `We are going to get offsetting cuts in the income tax area we are out of; our surplus.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What else do they find about that surplus? After having demonised us for about 10 months and having shattered confidence in this community in their ignorant process, they are finding that their surplus on receipts of company tax in particular is higher than they 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9360"> thought it would be. They have shuffled away from that, except they look at it cheerfully with a prospect of being able to fund further political offsets for their value added tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me tell you, my friend, since you are questioning me on this, that we are not going to be introducing a GST. We are not under the same political difficulty as far as that is concerned. What we will not let you do is put a GST in place on the backs of the elderly in this country, which in practical terms is precisely what you are doing. We intend to set aside a proportion of this surplus to provide exactly what is required to restore those massive cuts that are being put in place in the publicly funded provision of nursing home places.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So do not worry about where the resources are coming from. I will tell you where the resources are coming from, my friend. They are coming from precisely the same place you are going to fund your retreat on this particular proposition. But it is a retreat, I am afraid, that none of the elderly will believe. They know that, were you to be re-elected, you would, like so many monkeys in a zoo, bounce out of the cage again to perform to past practice. You would be right into it again with your little efforts to knock over the people who are going to enter those nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a hypocritical position for people who two years ago were going to the elderly in this community and thanking that generation for saving Australia: `This is our thanks, team! You had an anticipation through your working life while you were paying your taxes and educating your children'. I might say that we happen to be the children; those of us who are sitting around in this place, including me. We are not talking about the tidal wave of elderly that the minister talked about the other day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tidal wave of elderly that you referred to, Minister, is my mum and dad and your mum and dad. That is basically it. That is what we are talking about in this tidal wave. Let us give them a name, this tidal wave of elderly that you are referring to. There is no tidal wave of elderly immediately impacting upon the situation in which this government 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> finds itself. This is a program conceived in cynicism as far as this government is concerned, hopefully covered by a blackguarding of your predecessors when you immediately came into office. We do not happen to be about letting you get away with that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that that generation had an anticipation. It may well be the case&mdash;it probably was the case until you wrecked the superannuation arrangements that we put in place&mdash;that people now in their 20s, 30s and 40s have an anticipation of what they must do with some of their surplus income to prepare for their old age. But the folk who are impacted upon by this policy had no such anticipation&mdash;none whatsoever. The one mechanism of saving that most of those people believed they could sustain&mdash;it is excluded from all the assets tests for any of the purposes that you could conceive, even from capital gains taxes&mdash;is the one thing that everybody in this community anticipates that they have to struggle to provide for themselves. It is the one approved saving in every mechanism which has been put in place to encourage a particular type of expenditure for the long term. The one thing that is demanded of you is that you preserve your own home, and that is the one thing you have chosen to attack.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In choosing to attack it, you have produced a situation where a large number of people have turned up at meetings all around the place. Thankfully, many of those people will not need to use nursing homes. They will never find themselves in that situation, but every one of them thinks that they might. Every one of them knows this: it does not matter what taxes they pay; it does not matter whether or not they fought for their country; it does not matter whether or not they produced the goods that saved us; it does not matter a darn about all of that&mdash;they will have their assets confiscated down to $22,500 and stuck in a nursing home bond although the minister is not yet sure what he will arrive at as an acceptable catch.</PARA>

When Archbishop Carnley wrote to the Prime Minister, concerned about the Anglican homes, the Prime Minister wrote back to him and&mdash;for those of us who know about these sorts of correspondence&mdash;basically said to the Anglican Archbishop, `Stick it in your ear!' He says, `Why should you be concerned?' `Oh, sorry,' says the Archbishop, `my church is only providing a substantial proportion of the nursing homes! Sorry for speaking. Sorry for having a view. Sorry for asking a question about what we happen to be dealing with.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These churches have a mission. They are not in the situation of Mr Doug Moran. They are providing for ordinary Australians. Mr Moran, who is an avid devotee of this particular policy, was asked this question from Cathy Job on radio today:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">So you've got no time for those who are suggesting that old people having to sell their only asset, their family home, is a bit rich?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Moran replied:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, you know, Cathy, we've got to realise that there are a lot of bludgers in our society and I think that's got to stop because it imposes further costs onto the taxpayers of this nation . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Let me tell you, friends: the taxpayers of this nation, who happen to be the people who are going to occupy those nursing homes, were pretty darned pleased to see the public provision of nursing homes for them as time went by. He was then asked about retrospectivity. It has struck a few people that the test for this income fee, which we were talking about and which the minister has got so wrong, is in fact retrospective. Cathy Job asked:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">What about the retrospectivity? Backbenchers are also suggesting that it's unfair if pensioners have, for instance, helped their kids out with a housing deposit three or four years ago. They're now deemed under the five year rule to still be assessed on having that money. Is that fair?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They certainly are deemed to have that. It is certainly not fair in an emergency situation 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> like this. It puts a pensioner in a very difficult situation. But Mr Moran replied:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, in society there's been a lot of assets moved over the last few years, such as you've just quoted. And I think we could take the cases of the Skases and the Bonds that, you know, placed money offshore and that inquiries are still going on.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So this is the basis on which the judgment is made. All the people in Rockingham and all the people in ordinary, average, middle-income suburbs have got to be grabbed because of Skase and Bond. They have to be grabbed, have their houses confiscated and have that massive means test imposed on them. One of the extraordinary features of this is that the government says that we are in some way or another responsible for confusion amongst the elderly. I have to tell you, Minister, that people are phoning Centrelink and your department, but your department really does not have a clue. It is rather like you. They have received no guidance from you or your predecessors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not as though you have not had a bit of time to think about it. It is not as though you have not had time to put a few of these administrative processes in place. It is not as though you should not be in a situation where all questions can be answered immediately and accurately. But none have been. It is not as though you have not had time to provide answers to the views of people like Archbishop Carnley.

Remember, the Australian Democrats supported this legislation, as did a large number of consumer groups and the industry right around this country. They know that what is being proposed here is in the national interest to address the problems which I have talked about. Senator Woodley, on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The World Today</EMPHASIS> , said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I've got to say to you I think what Jenny Macklin has been doing is reprehensible because she has not at any stage come up with any alternatives. She has never tried to improve the legislation. She has never taken part in any positive contribution in this debate. She is simply scaremongering and she has really put a lot of fear into aged people. And I don't think that's the kind of political politics I want to see in this country. I am very angry about what the Labor Party is doing, and I think what they ought to do is play a constructive role so we can get reforms in place that the elderly people in our community will benefit from.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Hear, hear! So would say the vast majority of the people in this country who recognise that we have to put in place a sustainable policy to deal with the age demographic that confronts us all. Take note of the fact that nursing home costs grew by 41 per cent and hostel costs by 399 per cent in real terms in the 10 years to 1997. The total population is projected to increase by 38 per cent between 1991 and 2031. Over the same period, the proportion of population aged over 65 is projected to nearly double, from 11.2 per cent to over 19 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of immediate concern&mdash;this belies the issues that have been pursued by the Labor Party&mdash;is the rising proportion of very old people, those over 80, who need the high level of care services.

That is the fundamental issue that drove people like Gary Johns to say that the policy is correct. That is the fundamental issue that should be driving thinking contributors to the public debate. Indeed, any informed debate

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I quoted figures yesterday that show there is a crisis in nursing home standards in this country, and it is something we need to address: 40 per cent live in wards with four beds or more, 13 per cent do not meet fire standards, 11 per cent do not meet health standards and many of them do not meet Australian design standards. Professor Gregory, the person who advised you in 1994, said that we have a crisis where we must redress this capital imbalance and we must take account of the age demographic movements that are all about us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should be a point of honour in a country like ours, where we have increasing numbers of people moving into that age demographic, that we take pride in looking for a policy solution to provide them with quality care&mdash;care that will provide them with some security, care that will provide them with some dignity, something we can be proud of. A country like ours, as it grows and venerates the aged, should make sure that the facilities into which they are able to go meet all the standards that we would want.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is our responsibility in a national parliament&mdash;it does not matter what our politics are&mdash;to seek solutions. That is why the consultation process was taken on by my colleague the former minister, Judi Moylan. She did a good job. She consulted widely. She put together a policy that so many have endorsed. Let me give you some further quotes. Keith Woollard of the AMA said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The aged care reforms . . . is one way which Australia can come to terms with the massive increase in demand for quality accommodation and care of our ageing population. Now we have a government that is willing to make a tough decision that will ultimately benefit all aged care residents by providing proprietors of these facilities no excuse not to improve standards.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Why shouldn't we be improving standards? Denis Jones of the Australian Nursing Federation said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mrs Moylan has made a genuine effort to consult all groups involved in the massive overhaul of nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Gary Johns I quoted earlier. You ridiculed him, but how quickly you walk away from one of the thinkers on your own side. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The policy is correct. We'd already done it in hostels. I think it would only be a matter of time, if we'd remained in government, that we would have imposed it for nursing homes as well. It's logical. It's fair. It's reasonable.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) quoted yesterday the former Treasurer, the member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis). Obviously he was thinking along these positive lines as well. But what we had today from the Leader of the Opposition was, in a sense, shameful. He knows that we have to face this issue, and face it sensibly, and I have said that we will monitor the implementation process. I announced yesterday an inquiry into the residential care classification arrangements. We gave an undertaking at the time that we would do that, and we have done it. Those are the things that are important.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No amount of bluster and yelling and screaming from the opposition or attempts to misrepresent the facts are going to cloud the community's view that this government is doing what is right for the nation. I have to say to you: when we sit down with people, explain to them what the policy is, show them and go through it with them individually, and when the providers talk with them, they do understand that it is only fair and reasonable that, where they have 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9364"> a demonstrated capacity to do so, they provide some contribution. The exaggerated responses that we are seeing from the opposition I think belittle the overall intelligence of the Australian community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no substitute for yelling and screaming. You should be constructive, as John Woodley, the senator from the Democrats, said.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition leader mentioned Archbishop Carnley, the Anglican Archbishop. I wrote to Archbishop Carnley the other day in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Please be assured that whilst the fundamentals of the policy have been settled, I am quite happy to discuss aspects to ensure there is a greater understanding of the policy and that its implementation phase is fair to all concerned.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is our position. Let me also quote from Anglicare's press release of Tuesday, 24 June:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are delighted to work with the government on this. We will continue to work on these with the government in a joint committee of care, said Bishop Carnley.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was also some discussion in the questions from the Leader of the Opposition about the taxation position. He was quoting from the budget papers.

Twenty-five per cent are part pensioners. The system is above the $50 free area; it is a 25c in the dollar adjustment on the means test.

They do rely heavily on a caring government&mdash;and one thing that you can say about this government is that it has no care about it whatsoever. Another writer says in a letter to me:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You correctly point out that nursing homes currently really are an extension of the hospital system.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">One of the figures the minister has not given us is how many people go straight from a hospital bed into a nursing home. It is over 60 per cent, Minister, of very sick and frail people who go into a nursing home direct from a hospital bed because they need to be nursed. As this writer says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I firmly believe that nursing homes should return to the principle of need, not profit.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I heard the minister say earlier that he believes that his system is based on needs, not means. He is as naive as the previous minister because he knows and we know that money talks. If you have got $250,000, of course you are going to get a better nursing home bed. If you have got $250,000, of course you are going to get into a nursing home before the person who has only got $10,000. Don't be so naive! There is not an elderly person in this country who does not understand that money talks. Another persons says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Howard government seems to me, a 78&hyphen;year&hyphen;old pensioner, mean&hyphen;spirited, retrogressive, and on so many issues, just plain wrong&hyphen;headed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is from a church minister here in Canberra:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The present coalition government must go down in history as one of the most immoral to have ever governed our country. Its reduction of massive funding in the aged care area cannot be justified in any shape or form and to then abuse the aged care providers for inadequate facilities is hypocrisy on a grand scale.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Hypocrisy on a grand scale, Minister. That is how it is seen by one of the church leaders here in Canberra. They know, and you know, that this government took $500 million out of the aged care budget in 1996. So much for all your graphs. If you cared two hoots about the aged in this country, you would not have 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9367"> taken $500 million out of the aged care budget. Another elderly person, in a letter to you actually, Minister, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Why has the government so drastically cut residential aged&hyphen;care funding with the result that it will now no longer provide a basic service to its elderly citizens, a service which is regarded as an obligatory minimum in other developed and civilised nations, which, as with Australia, have religiously collected taxes over the years from the vast majority of these citizens?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is the case, and it needs to be said to this government, that these people have paid their taxes, they have paid their dues. It is not, as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) thinks, that these people owe a debt to the Australian government. They do not owe any debt; they should not have to pay to get what is an essential service to care for them, as another writer said, in the last port of call, in a nursing home. This person continues in his letter to you:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Why is the legislation so bizarre and in my opinion both punitive and discriminatory against elderly Australians? Why has your government seen fit to make the lot of elderly and, in many cases, frail Australians so insecure . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Don't worry, Minister, there is no doubt out there amongst the elderly about who they think has made them insecure. It is this government that has made them insecure. It is your policies that has made them insecure, because of course it is the case that most elderly Australians have one asset and one asset alone to pay this accommodation bond. And they do have to pay it. They do have to agree to pay a sum, and these sums we now know are anything up to $250,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have no doubt that homes in Launceston do not come for $250,000; they come for a lot less than $250,000. So people in Launceston who pay their up&hyphen;front fees, who pay their accommodation bonds, are going to be paying, what, $100,000 less $22,000, so maybe they will be paying $70,000. But we have no idea, do we, Minister, what the up&hyphen;front limit will be because you refuse to set a limit? You refuse to give anybody any comfort about what the limit will be. You refuse to set a limit because of course your mates in the nursing home industry do not 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> want you to set a limit. They want to get the money; they want $250,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does appear to be the case that those who are scaring elderly Australians are none other than yourselves. It is the Howard government that is scaring elderly Australians by making them sell their homes to get a nursing home bed, by making the vast majority of them have to confront something which none of them want to confront: the notion of losing their home because you took $500 million out of the budget. It is the result of this government's policies that people have to sell their homes. That is where the blame for the scare lies and that is clearly understood by elderly Australians. You will be condemned by elderly Australians for it at the next election.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would firstly like to say that I care for older people. I spent most of my working life looking after older people. I worked in an area that contained many older Australians. Honest members of any government will say that they do not always agree with everything that that government does. But I can assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that I strongly support what the government is doing in this area of aged care, and it relates in every possible way to the care and concern that we as responsible people leading Australia should have for our older Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Keating government, in my view, had two principal failures. Whilst the government did some very good things in its first two terms under Mr Hawke in micro&hyphen;economic reform, and in particular for hostel accommodation bonds or entry contributions in 1988, the two principal failures of the Keating government were, firstly, that it allowed us to finance social infrastructure on debt and asset sales instead of income and, secondly, that it allowed us in many ways to become a selfish country, a country in which we value our rights more highly than our responsibilities. The value of things was far more important than values under the Keating government and there was a preoccupation, by the time we took government last year, with the here and now rather than respect for the past and any kind of sensible planning for the future.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9368">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australians who have had the misfortune, in one sense, to listen to or see this debate today must be despairing&mdash;despairing of the confrontation, of the posturing, of the ideological invective and of the hypocrisy and manipulation, particularly from some of the speakers on the other side, in relation to this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This policy in aged care addresses a number of critical issues. It recognises, firstly, Australia's rapidly increasing aged dependency ratios. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) has many positive characteristics, I am sure, but I notice that one of the negative criticisms that are made of the Leader of the Opposition is that he is light on the intellectual application to policy. He said in the course of his address, `There is no tidal wave of elderly people immediately impacting upon this government.' What he is saying is that he, as the leader of the alternative government in Australia, is incapable of looking at where Australia is going to be 10, 20 or 30 years from now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1992 there were 5.3 Australians between the ages of 15 and 64 for every person under the age of 15 or over the age of 64. It is called an age dependency ratio. In 40 years time that ratio will be 2.6:1. If you read the National Commission of Audit report under the chairmanship of Professor Bob Officer last year, you will find that over the next 40 years we are going to have to spend 10 per cent more of our gross domestic product on the health and welfare costs of ageing. By the year 2001 about 13&half; per cent of us will be over the age of 65. Halfway through next century, almost a third of Australia will be over the age of 65 and, in the absence of a cure, approximately eight per cent of us over the age of 75 will suffer from dementia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This policy is not about harvesting votes from people who are justifiably cynical of the politicians who represent them in the political process. It is not about trying to capture the votes of people whose fears can be easily manipulated. It is about creating the kind of Australia in which when any of us eventually need care&mdash;and about five per cent of Australians eventually need residential aged care&mdash;a place will be available for us and it will be a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> place of quality and one in which we would be happy to have our own mother or our own father live. Whilst many nursing homes, including the Rose Bay nursing home that the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) referred to, are places that I would be proud to live in or have my mother in, there are many nursing homes that are not. If you look at what the previous government did in doing very good things in introducing this system into the hostel sector, you will see that it failed dismally to put sufficient funding into capital stock and care needs in the nursing home sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the policy also does is change cultural expectations. I said that one of the two principal failures of the Keating government was allowing us to become a selfish country. This policy changes an expectation so that young people, perhaps like me&mdash;although I am probably not that young any more&mdash;have to start thinking about who is going to finance our education, who is going to look after us when we are old, recognising, as I said earlier, that Australia cannot possibly afford, no matter how noble the proposition, to finance the aged residential care entirely for all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So at some point a government that has vision and is concerned for people has to do what we are doing. Some people on this side of the House, at great risk to themselves and their own political careers, are supporting this policy because they know it is the subject of political manipulation and misrepresentation on the other side. But they are doing it because they are here to change the country; they are not here to simply be here and get themselves re-elected all the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third thing this policy does is provide much needed money for capital through the accommodation bonds, through daily fees which will supplement the costs of providing care and through a new resident classification instrument. For example, at the moment 40 per cent of people living in hostels in Australia have levels of dependency and levels of need that should actually require them to be in a nursing home. You remember all the handwringing from the opposition when in government about dementia and how we had 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9369"> to put more money into dementia care. Do you know that these reforms will deliver a 30 per cent increase in funding for dementia care for people that are currently living in hostels and being underresourced under the policies of the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also amalgamates the nursing home and the hostel sector. We are saying to an aged couple that, when they go into a residential care facility, if one of them has the misfortune to have a stroke or suffer another disability, they do not have to be separated any more, they do not have to have one go to a nursing home after 50 or 60 years of marriage and find that they are separated and have the grief that goes with that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, for the first time ever in Australia's nursing home industry we are going to have prospective residents, their families, their lawyer, their accountant, whoever they want to be with them, standing at the door of a nursing home and saying, `If you think I'm going to pay $2,600 a year plus an interest stream to live in this dump, you've got another thing coming.' In other words, there will be strong financial incentives for not only the resident but also some relatives who have a very keen interest in their financial affairs to question the quality of what the person they love is about to receive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Labor Party went to the last election with a policy on aged care that was 210 words. If you read the policy, if you read between the lines, you will see that they would have done in government precisely what we are doing now&mdash;the same thing that Ms Cheryl Kernot supported and, I am sure, being the person of integrity that she is, will continue to support. The bonds that we are perhaps asking people to pay when they go into a nursing home will deliver $1.5 billion over the next 10 years to the capital stock and accommodation within which our older Australians live. In the last year the opposition were in government, they committed not $1.5 billion to nursing home capital stock but $12 million. As a part of our package we are actually putting $40 million just into capital stock for nursing homes in regional and rural areas, not to mention the additional money that is going in to support people who are 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> concessional residents who clearly cannot afford to meet an accommodation bond.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1994 Professor Bob Gregory was one of three major reviewers of the state of Australia's residential aged care and, in presenting one of the most detailed documentations of the situation, he found amongst other things that we needed to spend as Australians $1 billion in 1994 to bring our nursing homes up to meet fire, design, health and outcome standards. The Australian Office of Valuation Studies, for example, found that 13 per cent of nursing homes do not meet fire standards. Does the member for Jagajaga or the Leader of the Opposition want to continue to preside over a policy that in 1994 had delivered that? Seventy&hyphen;five per cent of nursing homes in 1994&mdash;after 11 years of Labor government and policy to which they want to revert&mdash;either had to be completely fixed or completely demolished and rebuilt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bond that we are asking people to pay can be paid as a single payment. If it is negotiated to $30,000, $40,000, $50,000 or $100,000, a person can say, `I will pay that into a prudentially controlled and regulated fund.' When they leave the nursing home&mdash;the average length of stay is 22 months but, sadly, 50.7 per cent of people do not live longer than a year and 37.7 per cent will not live longer than six months&mdash;they will receive all of their money back minus $2,600 a year,  six months in arrears plus the interest that would be normally earned on that bond.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do you know what the money has to be spent on? Cheryl Kernot, to her great credit, worked with Mrs Judi Moylan as the minister and she required&mdash;and this was totally supported by the government&mdash;that the money be spent on one thing only: the capital accommodation&mdash;the dwelling&mdash;in which that person lives. Or it can be spent on retiring debt that has been used to improve the accommodation or on the care of that person. It cannot be siphoned off as profit. It cannot be taken anywhere except to be spent on that particular person.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Alternatively, you might say, `Right, I have agreed my bond is going to be $50,000. I won't pay $50,000; instead I will pay $2,600 a year plus the interest that would normally 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9370"> accrue to $50,000. I will pay it every month, and my family loves me so much that they are going to help me pay it.' With the third option you may say, `I don't want to interfere with my finances in any way. I will take that $2,600 a year plus the interest normally earned as a debt against my estate. So I know that whenever I pass on, after whatever period I am in the home, you can take the money that is being spent on me&mdash;my accommodation and care&mdash;from my estate.' Having spent a number of years looking after frail, elderly people, I would question the motive of any relative that does not like that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yes, the generation that is immediately affected by this, to which the member for Jagajaga has referred, is a generation who went to war. They sent their husbands to war. They sent their sons and daughters to war. They lived through depressions. Their sacrifices made this country what it is. They did not buy something until they had saved up for it. They valued their responsibilities far more highly than their rights. They have led this country for 100 years, and in one sense they are going to lead us for the next 100 because this change, unpopular as it is when it is the subject of manipulation and distortion, is going to lead Australia into the next millennium and provide us with a finance system for residential aged care which is sustainable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sometimes it is important in this place to remember why we are here. We are not here to serve the political interests of the Liberal Party, the National Party, the Labor Party or those who cannot make up their mind. We are here to serve the interests of Australia, and sometimes you actually have to put aside your personal invective, you have to put aside some of your emotion and you have to do what is right. This policy is right. It might have one or two rough edges around it, but from the outset Minister Moylan and Minister Smith have been working with the industry and consumers to make sure that it works, and on 24 June 1997 the Australian Catholic Health Care Association expressed its gratitude to all members of the federal parliament for its reception of the association's concerns and suggestions.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the amendments be agreed to.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In doing so, I add that I do it with considerable reluctance and only because of the government's strong commitment to law enforcement. One of the bill's principal purposes is to authorise nominated members of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to issue interception and listening device warrants for law enforcement purposes. The Senate's amendments include a sunset clause to come into effect at the end of 1999 on the provisions enabling AAT members to issue warrants. The other amendments are to require each annual report to include infor 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="9376"> mation about the availability of judges to issue warrants and to require the 1999&hyphen;2000 annual report to contain a review of amendments made by the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition's amendments are illogical and unnecessary. In fact, reading the sunset clause and the reporting requirement together, the amendments are plainly stupid. They impose a time limit on the warrant issuing arrangements which will bring those arrangements to an end a full year ahead of the date by which the amendments require a report on the working of those arrangements. In addition, the whole telecommunications interception and listening device regime already contains extensive reporting requirements and strict controls. Moreover, the opposition chooses to ignore the practical reality that the federal judges who presently issue the warrants have decided collegiately to stop performing the function. The judges have decided that it is not a proper function for judges to perform, notwithstanding that the legislation conferring the function on them is valid. The function has been held to be an administrative not a judicial function. Accordingly, judges cannot be forced to perform the function.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor was aware of this problem in government. It did not, and has not yet, come up with a workable alternative. This government has provided an appropriate solution, yet the opposition says that this solution should cease to operate in two years time. One might ask whom the opposition proposes will then issue the warrants. Despite the empty posturing by the opposition parties about their commitment to fighting serious crime, what they have done in effect is to provide a temporary remedy which requires the parliament to revisit the same problem in under two years time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite their obvious faults, the government will accept the amendments. The government is taking this course because, unlike Labor, it is serious about fighting crime and does not want to delay the other important amendments in the bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is pleasing that the government is accepting these amendments. This was a compromise that was reached with other parties in the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Senate and it is an appropriate compromise. The fact of the matter is that, when Grollo's case was determined by the highest court in this land, it was an overwhelming majority decision that this was a proper function for judicial officers. The legislation was held to be valid. There are ways around this. This Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) could appoint more judges. This Attorney&hyphen;General, in conjunction with the chief judge of the Federal Court, could organise for duty judges in each of the states so that there is not a situation where every judge of the Federal Court would be required to look at the warrant situation. There are ways around this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a very intrusive and invasive procedure. There are practices in other jurisdictions around the world and a proper reading of Grollo's case shows that the majority decision found it was appropriate. We are not happy with the amendments either because we think the Attorney&hyphen;General should start acting like an Attorney&hyphen;General and that he should not be dictated to by the judges. This is a proper function. But the problem, unfortunately, is that the bean counters have got to this Attorney&hyphen;General.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a sunset clause for two years time and hopefully the existing position with Federal Court judges will be cleaned out of the system. You can also have a situation where the Chief Judge of the Federal Court, in two years time, can ensure that it is only certain judges who will perform these functions so that you do not have the whole of the Federal Court tied up in this area. I can give you this undertaking: in two years time, if there is a new government, the new government will not be looking to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to perform this function, which we think is totally inappropriate. That is why there is a two&hyphen;year sunset clause; we hope there will be a new government at the end of this government's current term. One term is enough for this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do welcome the fact that the government is accepting these amendments and it should be a matter of record that this is not a situation where we are totally happy with the amendments either; this is a compromise. But, in the intervening period, what it will allow 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9377"> to happen is that the Chief Judge of the Federal Court can bring in a system for the future, beyond the two years, that will see not all judges of the Federal Court performing this function. And there will not be any turnaround by a new Labor government. We will give sufficient resources to the Federal Court and to the judiciary, because that is part of the concept of a decent and humane society&mdash;access to justice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The trouble with this government is that they go against the separation of powers. The separation of powers was tested in Grollo's case where this function was held, by an overwhelming majority of the High Court, to be an appropriate function for Federal Court judges to perform. I do not think it is satisfactory for the Chief Judge of the Federal Court to say to the Attorney-General, `We do not want to do this.' Then the appropriate response to that is, `That is your duty in terms of'&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact of the matter is that a proper balance has to be found. We are not saying that every judge of the Federal Court should perform this function.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too support the amendment providing for a sunset clause in this particular change. I was interested in coming in and listening to the comments of the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and ascertaining the reason for the government deciding to accept these particular modifications from the Senate. I was interested because I would have thought the Attorney-General, being a staunch civil libertarian, would have been concerned, in the first instance, as to how the allocation or authorisation of Administrative Appeals Tribunal officers or members to issue telecommunication interceptions and listening device warrants would be a change&mdash;a significant change&mdash;in the balance between the interests of criminal law enforcement and civil liberties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a former police officer, as someone who has had an interest and has functioned in the criminal justice system, albeit probably in a lowlier position than that occupied in the past by the Attorney-General, I would have thought it part of the Liberal Party's philosophy to strengthen the civil liberties of a citizen against the state.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QT4">Mr FILING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a party, unfortunately, in the case of criminal law enforcement, that is more interested, perhaps more driven, by the interests of the bottom line, as the member for Banks (Mr Melham) has said&mdash;the sort of bean counter approach. I am sure that the Attorney-General, now that he is in cabinet, is in a much stronger position. The new minister for sport may be interested to know that I am, and have been, a very strong, very staunch supporter of the elevation of the Attorney-General to cabinet. The fact that he is now there means that there is a very significant addition to the voice of Western Australia in the cabinet, amongst other things.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, in particular, I know of the Attorney's reputation as a staunch civil libertarian, as somebody who would rather stand alongside the interests of the citizen versus the state rather than the executive versus the citizen. That he now is in a better position may be the reason why the government is now persuaded to accept these particular compromises&mdash;it is perhaps because he now is in the cabinet to represent the interests of the civil liberties of the Australian citizen.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9378">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that there is an awesome arsenal of resources and facilities available to the state in its weaponry to take on the citizens, particularly in the criminal law enforcement area. As the member for Banks has indicated, given the decision in the Grollo case, one would have assumed that it would have been preferable to have appointed more judges who would have been prepared to consent to taking on the role of hearing and considering applications for the issue of telecommunication intercepts and warrants. However, presumably because it is far more expensive to do that, the government has opted to have what I consider to be a highly unacceptable alternative of appointing or authorising AAT members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I indicated in my speech during the second reading debate, there has been an awesome explosion of tribunals and the like to hear just about every single type of complaint under the sun. I would have thought that, as a person committed to strengthening the civil liberties of individual citizens, the Attorney-General would have been loath to have seen what is, in effect, a lower status judicial officer having the authority to issue what are very awesome instruments&mdash;telecommunication interception listening device warrants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are awesome instruments because they have the opportunity of stepping into the life of a citizen in the guise of an investigation and of being able to be used to intrude very heavily into the privacy of a citizen, if that is considered to be applicable. I would have thought the higher the level of the judicial officer or the judge listening to an application from the relevant law enforcement agency for one of these warrants, the better. Even I, as a former police officer who knows of the delays that that sometimes may involve, considering the balance of those interests&mdash;the interests of the citizen versus the state&mdash;would have thought that a fair and reasonable balance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, given that we have had the Senate pass a number of amendments, I am pleased to see that they at least relate to the question of a sunset clause and to the information&mdash;of the availability of judges to issue 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> warrants under part VI and the extent to which nominated AAT members are being used for that purpose&mdash;which would be available to the citizen to enable them to see whether or not these changes have, in fact, given law enforcement agencies a greater facility to detect the ever&hyphen;widening crime rate. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition has a number of concerns about the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R304">Airports Legislation Amendment Bill 1997</XREF> . It is omnibus legislation which deals with a number of issues. Two or three of the proposals are quite unexceptional, and the opposition has no reservations about them. However, there are two matters to which we intend to move amendments. If those amendments are not successful, we will then oppose the legislation. There is also a further matter which we will seek to insert by amendment which I will refer to later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first of the major concerns of the opposition relates to the proposal to sell the remaining general aviation airports and two of the smaller RPT airports by freehold rather than long-term leasehold. That applies to Jandakot, Essendon, Moorabbin, Parafield, Archerfield and prospectively to Bankstown, Camden and Hoxton Park, including Tennant Creek and Mount Isa, which are not just general aviation airports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former Keating government introduced legislation to enable the sale of long-term leaseholds not only for the major airports, such as Melbourne and Sydney, but also for other FAC airports, such as the ones that I have just listed. It is important to note that what is occurring now is quite different from the local ownership program of airports that was put in place in the mid&hyphen;80s by the former Labor government. A very substantial number of smaller airports around the country were 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9379"> sold to public sector bodies&mdash;to local councils, port authorities and the like.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is proposed in this legislation is to enable the federal government to sell these quite important airports freehold to private operators and to shift the planning control with respect to those airports to state governments. The federal government would retain a variety of functions with respect to the operations of those airports, such as those currently carried out by Airservices and the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. It is interesting to note that the expressions from the various state governments so far on this proposal have either been indifferent or negative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is perhaps understandable that the Victorian government would be rather concerned about this proposal. If this legislation is passed, it may mean that Jeff Kennett, rather than simply throwing bombs from the sidelines on the fraught question of the future of Essendon airport, will have to make the decision himself and deal with the concerns of the National Party in his own state. The Victorian government is totally split on the question of the future of Essendon airport. At the moment he can wash his hands of the issue and allow the federal government to make the decision. Therefore, it is not totally surprising that the Victorian government does not appear to be widely excited about this proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leaving aside any desires that any of us may have to solve Mr Kennett's political problems, which is certainly not high on my priorities, there are good reasons for the House to reject this proposition. It is important to recall that the airport sales legislation which the former government put to this parliament and which was eventually adopted by the current government was based on long-term leasehold. It ensures there is some degree of residual Commonwealth control or residual Commonwealth influence in the conduct of the business of airports that will occur in these particular locations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true that the proposed sale would contain a caveat that the airport usage continue, but it means that the regulatory role that the Commonwealth plays would shift to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the states. It is noteworthy that the sale legislation that was put to the parliament by us and adopted pretty much intact by the current government would therefore see a substantial part of that regulatory activity shift to the states. I think that would be detrimental to the aviation industry in this country. It would be detrimental to the operations of a number of those airports which operate on an interstate basis. Both Moorabbin and Essendon, for example, host services to Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would mean that there would be an unduly parochial focus in the planning regulation of those airports. It would also mean that one of the major developments that has occurred in recent times at a number of those airports&mdash;pilot training and export pilot training, including Parafield, which is in the electorate of the honourable member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans), who is at the table&mdash;would be occurring under the auspices of different state governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You would not have the same degree of national focus that you currently have in encouraging, assisting and providing for what is going to become and is already a very significant export for Australia. It is a classic area in which we have significant competitive advantage, and the federal government should be doing everything it can to assist in the growth of this very worthwhile industry. It will not help if we end up with a mixed regulatory regime in these airports, where we have state governments intruding and having to play a role which could ultimately be at odds with the objectives that we have as a nation to develop the pilot training industry and a whole range of detailed issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also rather peculiar that we will end up in a situation where we have mixed state and federal regulation on major airports. It probably does not matter a great deal to have small local airports with state planning regulatory activities and organisations like CASA still responsible for safety, but it does for major airports with significant RPT functions and very substantial numbers of movements. In fact, even though it entails training and the figure is slightly distorted, these airports have the largest number of movements of any airports in the country. We will end up with 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9380"> a mixed regulatory structure, which is not a good recipe for the future of aviation at that level in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition opposes this proposal. We supported the leasehold arrangements and we continue to support that arrangement, but we do not believe there is any justification for moving to an outright privatisation; a sale of the freehold of these airports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition is opposed to the second substantial proposal in this legislation to remove decisions of the minister with respect to airport master plans, environment strategies and the like from the jurisdiction of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. It is proposed instead that these decisions would be the subject of a tabling in the House and, therefore, would ultimately be subject to judicial review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition believes that this is a substantial diminution of the rights of people in the community who are affected by airport operations, particularly those who live near airports and have a deep and intense interest in things like the contents of airport master plans. They should have every conceivable right to pursue those interests through the process of law and through the process of government to ensure that they get a fair deal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation diminishes those rights. There is no way around it: this legislation substantially diminishes those rights because the alternatives that will now be available to them will be more complex, more expensive and more difficult compared with the AAT.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This position was not adopted by the government before the last election. It was not announced in the debate prior to the airports sales legislation or, indeed, the sale of the airports themselves. In effect, it is a free kick for the new owners of the major airports at the expense of people living near and around those airports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It means, for example, that when Sydney airport is ultimately sold, the rights of those people who currently suffer the consequences of the airports' operations, and in particular the bizarre flight path arrangements that were introduced by the former minister for transport, Mr Sharp, will be diminished as a result 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of this legislation. The opposition does not support that proposal. We will endeavour to amend the legislation to remove it. If we are unsuccessful, we accordingly will oppose the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second reading speech really does not tell you precisely what is going on here. It seems that there even is a little bit of embarrassment about what the government is proposing to do. It is very elliptical about the concept of the proposal. It is noteworthy that the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) in his second reading speech referred to the tabling requirements as the new mechanism around which all the rights of local people would rotate. He said that these would apply `except to the extent that the commercial interests of a person would be substantially prejudiced'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So good old commercial confidentiality rears its ugly head again. I have no doubt that the implications of that statement are that local groups seeking to pursue their rights on issues of pollution and aircraft noise, or whatever the case may be, will bump into that problem on numerous occasions. That is a good illustration of why maintaining the AAT rights of people who are affected by the operations of these airports is very important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look around the country, you will see that these issues are already there. Only recently I was in Perth having discussions with the new owners of Perth airport about the prospective amendments to the master plan to include the possibility of an extension of the cross&hyphen;runway, which would have enormous implications for residents immediately to the west of the airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Brisbane there is the prospect of a parallel runway, which equally raises substantial concerns for many people there. In Sydney a very wide range of issues arises from the operations of the airport and will cause immense problems for many people there. These are existing, here and now issues right around the country. The regulatory regime that was put in place by the Labor government, which was balanced, fair and which gave local residents a fair go&mdash;it was not finally legislated because it was blocked in the Senate and then was adopted by the new government with the support of the Labor 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9381"> opposition&mdash;is now being eroded. We do not accept that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also worth noting in this context that there is another reason for opposing this: the ground rules for these airports are being changed after the sale. It is probably not a huge change when you are talking about many millions of dollars on the sale price. It probably would not have affected the price a great deal had the tenderers known at the time that there would be a new regulatory regime without the AAT involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nonetheless, there is an important principle here. It is a principle that the Premier of Victoria does not appear to recognise because the legislative requirements for the casino in Victoria were changed four times after the completion of the tendering process and the granting of the tender to Hudson Conway and the Crown Casino.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I concede this is not in that league. Nonetheless it is a significant benefit to the successful tenderers and something that I think those who were unsuccessful probably would have liked to have known about prior to putting in their bids and having them judged. For that reason also we have very serious reservations about this proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final position that the opposition wishes to advance with respect to this legislation relates to restrictions on cross&hyphen;ownership of airports. Under the coalition this has been something of a moveable feast. When the airport sales legislation was being dealt with by the parliament in the middle of last year, the former minister for transport got a phone call from Richard Court probably about 12 hours before the legislation was going to be dealt with in the parliament. Mr Court told him that he wanted Perth to be in the cross&hyphen;ownership rules, that he wanted restrictions on Perth being owned by other major airport owners and that he wanted equal treatment for Brisbane and Melbourne, which is what the original cross&hyphen;ownership rules applied to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lo and behold! With no warning or announcement to anybody, and with no discussion, Perth was included. The opposition accepted that. We said, `Fine. We do not have any problems with that.' But, if you want Richard Court to run the country, why not get 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> him up here, get him elected and put him in charge?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has now come up with another proposal on cross&hyphen;ownership, which was announced recently. Again it was out of the blue. But it was a Clayton's cross&hyphen;ownership proposal. With respect to Adelaide and Melbourne, Hobart and Launceston, Coolangatta and Brisbane, cross&hyphen;ownership would be banned&mdash;you cannot own both&mdash;for a period of two years. This would be enforced through the sale contracts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is purely a Clayton's cross&hyphen;ownership restriction. It effectively amounts to a government commitment not to sell the airports to the same owner. Two years is a pretty short time in the life of a new airport owner. It is unlikely that any owner of any of these airports is going to go to all the trouble of the tendering process, the investment and the pain and difficulty that that involves, and then sell within two years. In effect, all this is is the government saying, `We will sell Hobart and Launceston to different owners.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition supports that. What we are unhappy with is that, unlike the cross&hyphen;ownership restrictions that apply with respect to Melbourne, Brisbane vis-a-vis Sydney and, at the last minute, Perth, the government does not propose to legislate these cross&hyphen;ownership restrictions. There are good reasons why Adelaide airport should not be owned by the owner of Melbourne airport. There are good reasons why Coolangatta should not be owned by the owner of Brisbane. There are good reasons why Hobart and Launceston should be owned by different owners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We therefore think that if the government is serious we should insert those cross&hyphen;ownership restrictions in the legislation and, in addition, insert the one city, the one airport, that stands out as the one that should have been in the cross&hyphen;ownership restrictions, given that they are being extended, and for some peculiar reason was left out&mdash;that is, Townsville. Townsville airport should not be owned by the owners of Brisbane, and it should not be owned by the Cairns Port Authority, which owns Cairns airport and which has done an excellent job of running Cairns airport.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9382">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The airports at Townsville, Launceston and Hobart should be owned by local interests&mdash;those that have the interests of their local regional economy at heart, those that are tuned to those interests, those that are going to have their primary investment focus on that airport, those that are not going to see it as a poor relation and just there to keep the metre ticking over, to keep the till ticking over, but who see it as their primary focus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many subtle issues that will emerge in the administration of those airports. Local interests will be of considerable importance where the synergies that can emerge from the conjunction between local business interests, the local community, local government and the owners and operators of that airport will have a significant impact on the local community, and where absentee ownership potentially may not be as good. The differences might be at the margins but, nonetheless, they will be significant. Cairns is a good example, where local ownership has been of considerable benefit to the Cairns economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By ensuring that we have cross&hyphen;ownership restrictions and that they are enshrined in legislation, we will guarantee that there will be a maximum degree of competition between those airports where competition can occur. Clearly, there are limits on that. But in the cases of Brisbane and Coolangatta there is considerable potential for competition. That possibility should be maximised. In the cases of Townsville and Cairns, there is already significant competition between those two cities on a variety of fronts. We should not have a situation where their airports are owned by the same owner and, therefore, in effect, are not competing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Equally importantly, we want to ensure that the investment focus, the operational focus of these airports, has the local community and local regional economic interests paramount and not other interests. When you are marketing an airport, clearly you have to market a destination. Now that these will be private sector bodies seeking to attract flights, those who own them will be marketing the destination. If you own Townsville airport and are trying to get more planes to fly there you will 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> not only be saying, `We have a wonderful airport,' but also be saying, `We have a wonderful city here. We have a wonderful region. We have reasons for people to come here.' Therefore, the nexus between the ownership of the airport and that local regional community is extremely important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true that ownership restrictions potentially diminish price, but it is also worth noting a couple of  things. Firstly, the government, when it was in opposition, did make certain commitments, which it now appears to have reneged on, with respect to local ownership in areas such as Launceston. That is something that we in government were committed to and something we remain firmly committed to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the price return on the sale of the major airports was so far in excess of expectations that surely the government can afford to take a marginal reduction in price for airports that, ultimately, are not going to command huge dollars anyway. In order to ensure that the local regional economies in areas like Launceston, which desperately need more investment and more economic activity, get the best economic outcome, surely the federal government in the context of its total airport sales program can afford to get slightly below the optimal or the maximum price in order to benefit the local communities that those airports serve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those reasons, when the matter returns from the Main Committee to the House and is considered in detail we will be moving a range of amendments that refer to the matters I have outlined today. If those amendments are unsuccessful&mdash;because we regard these issues as being of considerable seriousness&mdash;we will be opposing the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The major GA airports and those two RPT airports should not be freeholded. They should remain within Commonwealth jurisdiction. They should be leased in the same way that the other airports are being leased to private operators. The AAT should continue to have the power to scrutinise ministerial decisions with respect to airport master plans and environment strategies so that those affected by airport operations have a maximum degree of capacity to pursue their 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9383"> interests within the law, within the legal framework and within the framework of government. Finally, the cross&hyphen;ownership restrictions that the government has put forward should be strengthened and inserted in the legislation so that they have the full force of the law, and they should be extended to Townsville.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It comes as no surprise to Labor that we are now back here in this chamber&mdash;some 14 months after the government announced its measure to apply an additional 15 per cent tax on the superannuation contributions of high income earners&mdash;about to debate a large package of bills which will supposedly fix the many problems associated with the government's ill-conceived 15 per cent superannuation tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What can I say? We told you so. By `we', I do not just mean the opposition. It would unquestionably have been easier for the government to defend its position if it had been a simple case of Labor opposition to the policy. But the crowd of people lined up to tell the government how hopeless its collection method for the superannuation tax was would have been big enough to fill the great southern stand at the MCG. We had the Business Council of Australia, the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia, the large accounting firms, Coopers and Lybrand and William M. Mercer, the AMP Society, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants and the Institute of Actuaries of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not as if all of those industry organisations would be losers as a result of the government's collection method. On the contrary, some of them stood to benefit greatly from a more complicated collection method. Accountants and actuaries, for example, would have had more work created for them by the government's measure. One might think that groups who stood to benefit from the convoluted superannuation tax collection method would not speak out against it, let alone actually propose a simpler collection method which may result in less business coming in. But Coopers and Lybrand, William M. Mercer, the AMP Society, the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants and the Institute of Actuaries of Australia did just that. In the end, out of sheer exasperation, they were screaming loudly like an AFL crowd on grand final day about the many problems that the government would 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9384"> encounter if it chose to persist with its error&hyphen;riddled collection method.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the advice offered the last time we debated these bills, despite the willingness and encouragement of the opposition for the government to change its method of collection of the superannuation tax, here we are again debating a set of bills designed to fix the government's superannuation tax mess.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I need to say right at the outset that the opposition will not be opposing this legislation because we believe that it is an attempt by the government to fix its superannuation tax mess. We believe that the government should&mdash;indeed, has an obligation to&mdash;clean up its own superannuation tax mess. However, we do have some concerns about these bills and the potential impact they may have. We will be supporting a reference of the package of bills to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation for comprehensive analysis and full public hearings as to the implications of these amendment bills. In addition, my colleague the member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis), the shadow minister for defence, will be moving some amendments relating to the way the superannuation tax applies to the military superannuation schemes and also some other measures to do with military superannuation which Labor believes are appropriate and which Labor has already announced publicly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an appropriate place and time to remind the Australian public exactly why the government needs to re-visit the superannuation tax legislation and some of the problems these bills purport to fix. These bills are designed to ensure that the superannuation tax applies to those not already covered by the previous legislation due to legislative errors or due to constitutional bars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bills fall into three broad categories. The first is the application of the superannuation tax to defined benefit funds, to members of constitutionally protected superannuation funds&mdash;they are primarily the state based funds of Western Australia and South Australia&mdash;and to Commonwealth public sector superannuation funds, civilian, military, judicial and parliamentary. The second category is consequential amendments resulting 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> from the application of the superannuation tax to the above funds. The third category is technical amendments to existing legislation arising out of previous Senate amendments to the superannuation tax bills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government did not intend in its initial legislation that certain funds and fund members would be excluded from having to pay the superannuation tax, despite being told that this would happen on numerous occasions. However, the complexity of the collection method and the initial legislation and also some constitutional uncertainties did, in fact, exclude some superannuation funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why was the collection method the government chose so complex and so subject to constitutional uncertainty? The answer is quite simple and quite damning. To collect the superannuation tax in a way which was administratively the simplest and most cost effective would have meant breaking solemn commitments made before the last federal election not to raise the rate of existing taxes nor to introduce any new taxes, but that is exactly what this is&mdash;a new tax. That is the real reason why we are here again today considering the bills before the House&mdash;because the government made a promise before the last federal election which it broke immediately following that election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How did the government deal with the fact that it was breaking its promise not to introduce any new taxes and not to increase existing taxes? It tried to deceive the Australian public by implementing what it called a surcharge but which everyone in the country knew was really another tax. It tried by sleight of hand to slip a new tax on superannuation past the people of Australia, calling it a surcharge and hoping nobody would notice. Well, people did notice. They noticed and they do not like being deceived. They are not impressed by governments who try to disguise broken election promises with the sophistry of calling a tax a surcharge. It did not work anyway. The superannuation tax which the government tried to hide by calling it a surcharge is now called a tax because of Labor's amendments in the Senate, which were designed to inject some honesty into the debate and to give the government  the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9385"> opportunity to go back to the drawing board and design a better collection method for the tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the government could have saved us and itself a lot of trouble in the first place by calling the surcharge a tax and administering it in the most efficient manner possible, rather than in the error ridden manner which it chose. Of course, the government has shown that it is pretty good at hiding its taxation commitments. We all remember Mr Howard's pre&hyphen;election statements about a GST not being on the Liberal Party's policy agenda now or in the future, but we know that it is now back on the agenda and we know that as a result people who presently do not have to pay tax on food, on clothing, on services such as haircuts or on visiting sports fixtures will now be expected to pay a tax of the order of perhaps 15 per cent in order that others who are paying luxury taxes&mdash;who are already well&hyphen;to&hyphen;do&mdash;can pay less in luxury taxes and less in income taxes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What exactly are the errors in the superannuation tax which these bills are purporting to fix? It seems to me that there are at least 10 bungles in the initial superannuation tax, and I want to take the House through them. The first is that the superannuation tax did not apply to state politicians, judges and public servants because they are in constitutionally protected schemes. The government was hoping to get the states to pass complementary legislation which would have allowed the tax to be collected from state public servants, judges and politicians but, unfortunately, that has not gone as hoped.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Watching this in action, I have got to wonder how the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) is going to go with his uniform retail tenancy code. He came into the House recently and said that he was going to fix up the problems of retail tenants but, when you looked at what he actually intended to do, you could see it was to go back to the states and get them to agree to matching complementary legislation around the nation. I certainly hope, for the sake of the retail tenants of this nation, that the small business minister goes very much better than the Treasurer (Mr Costello) did 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> with his complementary legislation to allow the super tax surcharge to be collected from state public servants, judges and politicians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because of the failure of the government to get the cooperation of the states, we have here as part of this package two additional bills which will have the superannuation tax apply to these fund members. True to form with this superannuation tax, the way that the government is proposing to do this will create even further complexity, confusion and uncertainty for both superannuation funds and the fund members affected. Like the superannuation tax collection method for schemes which are not constitutionally protected, superannuation funds will be required to notify the Australian Taxation Office of a member's taxable superannuation contributions. However, for constitutionally protected schemes, it will be the fund member who is liable for the superannuation tax, rather than the superannuation fund itself. This, of course, differs from schemes which are not constitutionally protected, where the superannuation fund itself is liable for the superannuation tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to remember that one of the reasons the government claimed its superannuation tax was not a tax was that it said the superannuation funds will be paying it, not the individual member. But, for constitutionally protected schemes, the opposite will be happening. So the government's feeble defence that it was not breaking an election promise now stands completely exposed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second bungle in the superannuation tax legislation was the government's failure to include federal public servants, judges and politicians. It is amazing to think that the government came up with a policy which did not include its own employees. One would have thought that the government would have been able to at least ensure that its own employees set an example by paying the tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third bungle was the government's admission that it would have to redraft the legislation to correct problems in collection from the defined benefit funds. This problem arose from the government's attempt to make the legislation fit within the constitution after Dennis Rose QC pointed out that the tax was unconstitutional. The government's subse 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="9386"> quent change to the legislation altered the definition of contributed amounts and excluded some defined benefit funds from having to notify the Australian Taxation Office of a member's surchargeable contributions. This became a wider problem when one considers that many so&hyphen;called accumulation funds could actually be considered as defined benefit funds in certain circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fourth bungle related to evidence suggesting that the tax could be an eligible tax deduction. It is absolutely absurd that a tax, which is intended to raise revenue for the government, could be considered as a tax deduction, therefore negating the whole value of the exercise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fifth bungle relates to concerns that, in defined benefit funds with benefit cliffs, individuals could be assessed as having a total superannuation tax liability of higher than 15 per cent. The government seems to have understood the unfairness of the impact of this measure and has now apparently moved to ensure that does not happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That makes five bungles which this package of bills is proposing to rectify. The disappointing aspect of the next five concerns&mdash;or bungles&mdash;that I will identify is that they are errors in the government's model which no amount of legislative tinkering will adequately fix. The only way the government could fix the mess it has created would be to change the entire foolish collection method it adopted. For example, the government's legislative amendments are, unfortunately, too late to prevent rises in fees and charges as superannuation funds put in place ridiculously complicated systems to collect and process the information needed to pass on to the Australian Taxation Office. That is bungle No. 6. The estimated collection costs could be up to $100 million. Then there is the huge cost to superannuation funds of having to collect thousands of tax file numbers from members who, for their own reasons of privacy, may have chosen not to give their tax file numbers to their superannuation funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A perspective on the government's cost bungle is offered by Noel Davis, a partner with Clayton Utz, solicitors, who has followed the technical details of the government's 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> superannuation tax closely. Mr Davis wrote this in a recent <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Superannuation Bulletin</EMPHASIS> article:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because of the deficiencies and complexities of the legislation imposing this tax . . . the cost of implementing the administration systems to collect the tax will probably exceed the amount of the revenue received by the Government from it.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is absolutely incredible. The cost of implementing the superannuation tax collection system could exceed the revenue the government receives from it. Why? Because of the deficiencies and complexities of the legislation, according to Mr Davis, who is an expert in superannuation law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the government clearly does not care about is that, as superannuation funds pass on these added collection costs to fund members by increasing fees and charges, those increases will disproportionately affect low and middle income earners. In other words, government claims that this is a tax on higher income earners, those earning over $70,000, are false. Lower and middle income earners will be paying higher fees and charges in order that the government can collect it. So much for the government's claims in its budget boasts last year that it was attacking the top end of town.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bungle No. 7 is the revelation that up to one million lower and middle income earners would have to pay the tax. This will occur because of the fact that those who do not provide their tax file number to their superannuation fund will be liable for the tax regardless of how much money they earn. What that means is that many low and middle income earners will in fact pay the superannuation tax. Just to check on whether that would be the case, one of the opposition staff rang the Australian Taxation Office yesterday to ask what would happen if he did not provide his tax file number to his superannuation fund. Would he have to pay the superannuation tax? The answer was yes, he would have to pay the superannuation tax if he did not provide his tax file number to the superannuation fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have noticed the public advertising campaign that the Australian Taxation Office is running at the moment asking people to give 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9387"> their tax file numbers to their superannuation funds, using the slogan `Don't make an expensive mistake'. The irony in using a slogan like that is that it is the government that has made the expensive mistake. It will be interesting to find out from the Australian Taxation Office in the upcoming round of estimates hearings exactly how expensive the government's mistake is. I would imagine that advertising of the character that we are now seeing with the tax file number campaign does not come cheaply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The eighth bungle in the government's superannuation tax collection method, which this legislation also will not remedy, is the constitutional problem. The House may recall the claims by Denis Rose QC that the new tax was illegal, particularly noting the fact that existing judges would have to be exempt. The question mark over the constitutionality of this tax can only be finally resolved by legal challenge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ninth bungle relates to actuarial concerns about the guidelines for assessing the tax liabilities of individuals in the defined benefit funds. This one will also be ongoing. Some actuaries have already indicated that they will be unable to prepare some individuals' tax liability assessments in time for superannuation funds to meet the government's 15 December deadline for reporting to the ATO. This is a matter of considerable concern. The government announced back in August last year that the superannuation tax was coming, yet we still have a situation where people in defined benefit funds are unable to know just what the impact of these changes will be on their superannuation entitlements as the 15 December deadline approaches. As we come towards a year and a half after the government first announced these changes, it is simply not good enough that people in these funds are unable to ascertain what their superannuation situation actually will be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The actuaries are also concerned that, because of the nature of the calculations they are being asked to prepare, they may be personally liable if they overestimate an individual's tax liability. Again, this problem 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> arises as a result of the government's chosen method to collect the superannuation tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tenth bungle is the inequitable tax treatment of golden handshakes depending on whether they are taken as cash or are rolled over. This is something which the Labor opposition has raised with the government previously in Senate estimates, as indeed has one of the government's own members, Senator John Watson, who, as the House may be aware, has expressed great concern about the impact of the superannuation tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there we have it: 10 commandments, 10 superannuation tax bungles, of which this legislation will fix only five. It would be nice to think that it would stop there but, with the complexity of these provisions, I am not so sure. Unfortunately, no amount of fiddling will fix a bad policy which regrettably appears to have caused a decline in confidence in the entire superannuation system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor has worked hard since 1983 to build Australia's enviable three pillars retirement income system, of which superannuation is a crucial component. Over the period when Labor was in government, there was an enormous change in focus given to superannuation saving as part of the government's retirement income policy objectives. It was Labor which positioned superannuation to make a major contribution towards achieving our national savings objectives over the medium term. By any measure, our achievements were quite remarkable. We overwhelmingly succeeded in our objective of extending access to superannuation benefits throughout the work force, especially to women and part&hyphen;time employees, who previously were largely excluded. When we assumed office in 1983, only about 40 per cent of workers had any form of superannuation. Today the figure is around 90 per cent. It was Labor which established the foundations for a progressive improvement in the level of superannuation saving through the superannuation guarantee, and hence progressive improvements in end benefits upon retirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was Labor which put in place a strengthened prudential regime through the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 which provides all of us with greater confi 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="9388"> dence that the benefits promised by superannuation saving will in fact be realised. The end result of Labor's superannuation policies will be substantially higher incomes in retirement for ordinary workers. That is why it is particularly galling to see that good work being undone through bad policy and a lack of vision from a government which has no commitment to superannuation and which neglects our future. We have had a great deal of rhetoric from this government about debt and deficit. We all remember the debt truck and all those lines&mdash;`stealing from our children, mortgaging our future'. What on earth are these attacks on superannuation, if not stealing from our children, mortgaging our future, whittling away our capacity as a nation to provide for our own future?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's collection method for the superannuation tax is bad policy. Only the government believes that it is not bad policy. I have said that the opposition will not be opposing this legislation because it does represent an attempt by the government to fix some of its 10 superannuation tax bungles. However, given the complex nature of this entire issue and the uncertainty and confusion which surround the superannuation tax in general, we will be supporting a reference of the package of bills to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation for comprehensive analysis and full public hearings as to the implications of these amendment bills. We will be moving specific amendments in the area of military superannuation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rising tonight, I do have to support this particular bill because I had supported quite strenuously the Superannuation Contributions Surcharge (Assessment and Collection) Bill 1997 on 20 March this year. In that bill this surcharge was applied to the residents of Lindsay who earn over $85,000. Therefore, tonight I think it is only appropriate that it also applies to members in this place and that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> we do not seek, by our position and our ability to influence and pass laws for all of Australia, to somehow exclude ourselves from those laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This series of bills before us tonight were absolutely essential for the even-handed process of government which the Howard government has put into place since it came to power on 2 March 1996. This government is committed to the same standards for all. It is not a matter of having double standards; it is a matter of setting very high standards and applying them across the board. We have done that successfully on numerous occasions right throughout our time in government. Tonight is yet another example of that. Certainly someone in a superannuation scheme that does not receive employer contributions such as those funded out of consolidated revenue was in a position for a windfall gain in terms of not paying the costs which the entire society has been requested to pay at some stage for the excesses of the last 13 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The entire package&mdash;the original bill and these subsequent bills&mdash;is designed to raise $500 million in revenue. That money would not have been required to be raised if it had not been blown by Labor in the last years of their blithering administration. They were $10 billion in debt when we came into power. That was unbeknownst to us. In funding any of our election promises we had assumed, as we had been told, that the budget was squared away. In fact we knew already that we had $17 billion&hyphen;odd to pay back on previous years overexpenditure. The last five years of the Keating administration saw Australia go heavily into debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had to turn that around. All of society has been asked to contribute to turn that around, not just the residents of Lindsay but also the people in this place, the people in the other place and judges. Members of our defence forces, whose super schemes are under the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act and the Military Superannuation and Benefits Act, are also required to contribute. The Governor&hyphen;General himself is not exempt. This package of legislation goes towards

They have neglected our future, they did steal from our children, they did mortgage our future&mdash;and it is time to pay the piper.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson) has said, the opposition does not oppose these measures. It recognises the essentiality of them. Given that we already have the superannuation contributions tax, it would be most inequitable not to apply it to everyone at the income levels at which it is supposed to apply. Obviously, for the people in defined benefit schemes&mdash;the constitutionally protected schemes&mdash;not to be affected by it would be inequitable, and therefore we support it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I would like to make some general points. Firstly, if I could just make a point about the budget for the benefit of the honourable member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly). When this party left government the budget deficit figure, even on the $10 billion figure always used by the then opposition and now government, still gave Australia a budget position which was better than that of almost any European country. It would easily have qualified for the Euro&hyphen;currency provisions by an amount which is about two per cent of GDP budget deficit when the limit they have set is three per cent&mdash;and they are all battling to meet it even now. So the budget position that we left this country when we went out of government was better than that of virtually any country in Europe except Luxembourg. Let us get that on the record. This nonsense about how we left some terrible, disastrous budgetary position is just that&mdash;absolute nonsense. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to refer to a number of general factors about the measure before us, the superannuation contributions tax. Firstly, as has been mentioned by the member for Wills, it is a clear breach of the election promise of no new taxes and no increase in any tax made by the now Treasurer (Mr Costello) time and time again before the last election. That promise is completely broken by this measure. On page 11 of their published superannuation policy, it was said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Taxation: A Coalition Government will retain the current taxation treatment of superannuation . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It went on to talk about how the RBLs were a good form of defining the basis for tax support. The superannuation contributions tax as it is now known&mdash;not the `surcharge' as they tried to call it at first&mdash;is a complete breach of the coalition's election promise not to introduce any such tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, this clear breach of an election promise comes in addition to another absolutely clear breach of an election promise: to implement the previous government's superannuation policy in relation to co&hyphen;contributions for employee contributions. That involved using the second leg of the tax cuts to provide matching contributions for employees, subject to a means test. The then coalition opposition, now government, promised the Australian people faithfully that they would implement that policy if they were elected. That policy has now been completely and utterly broken. It is a $4 billion breach of promise&mdash;a spectacular breach of promise. You promised to give people $4 billion and then you do not do it. It is not just some minor event that we are talking about here; it is an extraordinary breach of promise. On top of that you impose a tax of half a billion dollars that you said you would not introduce. This government has no credibility whatsoever in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, because of their sensitivity about breaking their election promise not to introduce any new taxes, the government have foisted an incredibly cumbersome and expensive administrative arrangement on employers, superannuation funds and the Australian Taxation Office. They are doing that because of the subterfuge that they went through over 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9390"> the surcharge&mdash;`We will put a surcharge on the funds, we will say that is not a tax and, therefore, we will not be breaking our election promises.' That subterfuge has been blown away by the amendments in the Senate. The surcharge is now described as a tax. It is unambiguously clear that we have a tax, but the nightmare administrative arrangement which the surcharge involved remains; in fact, it becomes more nightmarish as we see the detail for dealing with unfunded schemes where there is no annual contribution to tax. You have a superannuation contributions tax on funds where there is no contribution so you have to make one up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These superannuation bills are largely about making up a basis for a tax to apply to contributions where there are no contributions until the end benefits are payable. To do that, we have an incredibly cumbersome array of administrative arrangements, which I will mention later in some detail. I would like to note in passing that all this sits rather oddly with the promise faithfully made to the industry by the now Treasurer prior to the election that the superannuation policy of the coalition was one of `confidence, certainty and simplicity'. That is what he said they would bring to the industry. I would say that none of that exists as a result of this government's measures and of all the mucking around, particularly with the extraordinary administrative complexity of this tax which has foisted costs on the industry, reduced benefits and generally got the industry very off&hyphen;side&mdash;and rightly so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fourthly, I refer to the unfairness of this tax. It requires the tax file number of each contributor to be notified to their superannuation fund and then to the Taxation Office. If the member does not provide the tax file number, they are hit with the superannuation contributions tax, as the member for Wills explained. He mentioned that industry estimates are that up to a million people could be wrongly taxed. The ATO campaign, which is starting now, will hopefully reduce that number, but it would certainly seem that a lot of people are not going to understand the importance of this issue and are not going to furnish their tax file number. That is apart 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> from the fact that, despite being low or middle income earners who should not be subject to this tax, they will be subject to it, which will mean that it is an unfair imposition on them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fifthly, we have the issue of driving high income earners out of superannuation. Only a mug with a high income or someone who has no alternative because they are compelled to contribute would bother contributing while there is this tax. There is simply not anything in it any more; it is just not fair. There is a marginal degree of tax concession, but for people with relatively high incomes that is a pretty small element to receive in return for tying their money up for decades and decades&mdash;and for what? For a concession that virtually does not exist!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just look at the tax regime that currently exists, and will exist, with the superannuation contributions tax. For funded lump sums, we had a 15 per cent tax on contributions and a 15 per cent tax on earnings. The lump sum was tax free on the first $83,000, and then there was a 15 per cent tax on the lump sum over $83,000. So the tax level on the lump sum could be up near 30 per cent for lump sums well over $83,000. There was 15 per cent on the contributions and the earnings and 15 per cent on the end benefit, or near to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now that goes up, with the superannuation contributions tax, to 30 per cent on the contributions and 15 per cent on the earnings. The lump sum is tax free on the first $83,000 and then attracts a tax of 15 per cent. So the tax level rises to near 45 per cent for large sums. That is almost at the top marginal tax rate&mdash;47 per cent, or 48.4 per cent with the Medibank levy. Why lock your money away for decades just to save 3 per cent? That is what people will be saying to themselves: `Why am I doing this? What is in it for just 3 per cent?' Even if it is for 4 per cent or 5 per cent, it is relatively little.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For superannuation pensions, the tax rate will now be over 60 per cent. For funded schemes, there was a 15 per cent tax on contributions and earnings. The tax on the pension was the marginal rate minus 15 per cent&mdash;that reflects the 15 per cent paid on the contributions and earnings&mdash;so the total tax 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9391"> was at the marginal rate. Now, with the SCT, there is 30 per cent tax on the contributions, 15 per cent tax on the earnings, taxed on the pension at the marginal rate minus 15 per cent, so the total is near to 63 per cent. There is 30 per cent on the contributions and there is the top rate&mdash;48 per cent minus 15&mdash;which is 33 per cent. So you are talking about marginal tax rates on a pension of about 63 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why would you put your money into a superannuation scheme to pay a 63 per cent tax rate? Why would you do it? The answer is that people are not going to do it. Anecdotal evidence certainly is that they are not doing it. It will take a while to see the hard impact of that, because it will take time for people to unwind arrangements and salary packages, et cetera. But I am sure that we will see a lot of high income earners walking away from this area of saving, and understandably so. They will put their money where it has a better tax concession. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) says he will keep negative gearing, so people will stick their money in there, or they will put it somewhere else&mdash;into the family home or somewhere&mdash;where it is not going to attract tax rates which are at, near or above the top marginal tax rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This also comes with a potential impact on savings. If high income earners are not going to put their money into superannuation, they may put it into another savings device or they may not. They may just squander it in some way or other, which is clearly not good for national savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the superannuation contributions tax in general is an incredibly poor piece of policy to address a perceived inequity in superannuation. Labor's approach was much better. What we proposed&mdash;and what the coalition said that they would introduce and then broke their promise on&mdash;was a policy which improved the equity of the superannuation system considerably. What it did, with the matching contributions being means tested, was to make sure that the $4 billion of matching contributions&mdash;when it was fully phased in&mdash;all went to low and middle income earners. And higher income earners&mdash;that is, those receiv 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ing over twice average weekly earnings&mdash;got nothing. Had that system been introduced, this clearly would have improved the equity of the superannuation system considerably. Now that that promise has been broken&mdash;it is not being introduced, and we have this tax instead&mdash;we have a rather less equitable arrangement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And we also have a greater impact on savings, because the scheme we were going to introduce would have added 1.7 per cent of GDP to savings eventually, according to the Treasury retirement income modelling task force. Without that, we do not get any of that benefit. What we get is this superannuation contributions tax, which cannot improve national savings, because it is taxing savings and taking them to another form of savings. It is taking from private savings to public savings; there is nothing going to national savings. But, in so far as it drives people away from that area of savings to squander their money, you have a net loss of savings, and that is basically what will come from this whole measure.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have here could be said to be another form of SG. We have the superannuation guarantee, often abbreviated as the SG. Some people have said that this is certainly an SG&mdash;it is the spruce goose of the tax system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The superannuation bills now before the House have tremendous complexity in terms of the way in which they go about trying to raise the tax, because they are trying to tax contributions that do not exist. For unfunded defined benefits schemes there are no contributions by employers to apply a superannuation contributions tax to, so these bills provide a means of inventing them. In the process, they develop a tangle of red tape which makes an utter joke of this government's promise to cut red tape by 50 per cent for small business and of its general approach of saying it is about cutting red tape.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not sure that time will allow me to go through this entirely, but, in brief, the process you have to go through is this. What happens in the case of defined benefits schemes is that, firstly, the tax applies if the adjusted taxable income is above $70,000, or, as adjusted, I think, $73,200 this year, and fully from $85,000, or, as adjusted, $88,900.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9392">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, to find out what the adjusted taxable income is, one has to find out what the surchargeable contribution by the employer is, because it is not just your taxable income, it is your taxable income plus your surchargeable contribution by the employer. To find that out, one has to work out a notional surchargeable contribution factor; or at least actuaries have to work that out. The fund has to get the actuaries to do that. As the member for Wills said, the actuaries are unhappy about this process and about the position that they are being put into. The tax commissioner has had to issue a ruling to try to provide some basis for them to operate on, but they are concerned about the fact that there could be many complaints about the subjective decisions they have to make in working out this notional surchargeable contribution factor on which tax will be based.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once we have that, the fund is required to notify the tax office of the surchargeable contribution. So you have got the surchargeable contribution being worked out on the basis of the notional surchargeable contribution factor being applied to the employer's contribution. That is notified to the tax office. The tax office calculates the member's adjusted taxable income, calculates the rate of surcharge that applies, if any, and makes an assessment of the surcharge payable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then the superannuation provider&mdash;that is, the fund&mdash;is required to maintain a surcharge debt account with annual assessments of the surcharge payable being added to that account. Interest has to be calculated on that account at the 10&hyphen;year bond rate. The contributor can pay the surcharge each year if they wish but, if not, it adds up year by year with interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When a person retires, there is a surchargeable debit in their account, and this has to be paid to the ATO before any lump sum is paid. But before one gets to that point, one has to have an assessment as to whether what is in the surchargeable debt account is actually the amount the contributor should pay. The board of trustees is required to determine, in writing, the surcharge deduction amount that it considers would be fair and reasonable, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> having regard to a number of factors. This is because the contributions that could have been paid by the employer over time might be too much or too little in relation to the end benefits being obtained by the member, and the board of trustees&mdash;extraordinarily&mdash;is put in the position of virtually deciding what the tax liability of this person is. The board of trustees is there to look after the member's interests, not to determine his tax bill, but this is what is happening here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The board of trustees, the defender of the member of the fund, has to work out whether the amount that is in the surchargeable debt account is fair and reasonable. If it is too little, they have to increase it&mdash;to increase the member's tax. If it is too much, they reduce it. But it puts an onus on the board of trustees which I find quite extraordinary; indeed, a conflict of interest. Surely, their interest is to look after the member's fund interest as much as possible, not to work out his tax bill. The tax office should make that decision. This is just off&hyphen;loading the work onto the fund. This is a quite extraordinary development that has to look at all sorts of measures which I will not go into because of lack of time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a cap of 15 per cent on the surcharge deduction amount, which is a good thing. If the end benefit is to be paid as a pension, then the board of trustees, on advice of its actuary, has to determine the conversion factor to work out the deduction from the pension that is required each year to pay off the surcharge debt. This calculation does not just use any conversion rate from pension to lump sum that might be in the fund. It has to work on a market rate, et cetera, and it is quite a complicated calculation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So you have got all these expensive, costly steps which are adding cost to the system, and it is all avoidable. What the fund has to go through is just extraordinary, and I will not go through a summary of all that, but it could all have been avoided. If you want to increase the tax on people with high levels of superannuation, the simple thing to do would be to increase the tax on their end benefits&mdash;on their lump sum or their pension. But of course that would have been a tax, and that is why they would not do it. They said, `We are not 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9393"> taxing anybody, we are only surcharging the funds.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because we had this pretence that they were not breaking election promises, we have this extraordinary complexity which is increasing the cost for the funds enormously, reducing benefits for members because they have to wear those increased costs in terms of lesser benefits and unfairly impacting on a lot of people who should not be affected by it, who do not provide their tax file number.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a disastrous policy. It may well not raise anything like $500 million and, if it does, it will probably be because hundreds of thousands of people who should not be paying the tax are paying it. This is a total disaster of administration and it ought not to be continued. If the government wants to tax people at a higher level, it should do it in the simple way and not in this roundabout, absurd, costly way.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In many respects this superannuation legislation is not especially controversial, but I must say that I found myself in tune with many of the criticisms of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis), some of which I will touch on and some of which, I suspect, I raised when the principal act was being debated but which are still valid as expressed by the honourable member.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The intent behind the amendments in the  Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Superannuation Contributions Tax) Bill 1997  is to better align the statute regulating accounts held in unfunded, defined superannuation funds to those held in funded schemes. Any lack of symmetry is the direct result of the government's poor handling of the whole superannuation surcharge tax issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 13 September 1997, in a review of the principal superannuation surcharge legislation, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> newspaper said, `The government's superannuation surcharge on high income earners contains so many flaws that $250 million in expected revenue is at risk this year.' That comment was not particularly new, either. On the contrary, this was the very same argument raised by peak taxation organisations, including the Taxation Institute 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of Australia, at the time the parent legislation was introduced and debated in this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Had the coalition been prepared to take the time to consult widely with those who have the expertise, this follow&hyphen;up legislation would not have been necessary. Instead, it adopted a `take no prisoners' approach, the result being that valuable debating time has had to be allocated once again in this place to bring about changes that should have been incorporated in the original legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the most serious deficiencies in the act was that it had little application to defined benefits funds. This bill amends nine existing acts so that public servants, new federal judges, federal members of parliament, the Governor&hyphen;General and Defence Force personnel are liable to pay the additional superannuation impost if their annual incomes exceed $70,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed amendments will, amongst other things, guarantee that neither the termination payment surcharge nor the superannuation contribution surcharge is tax deductible. Such deductibility was never the intention of the government and the provision merely serves to close off a loophole that was overlooked in the original act. The bill also means to restrict the information relating to the details of surchargeable contributions that have to be forwarded by a provider to a fund member. As the Institute of Chartered Accountants has observed, prior to this amendment providers would have been required to give a copy of the whole statement to the member, including a mass of identifying material. It is my understanding that this amendment is not a concern to those in the superannuation industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In cases where the assessment of an individual's surcharge liability is reviewed and reduced, this bill will oblige the Australian Taxation Office to pay interest on the payment of the surcharge. That too is unobjectionable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because most of those affected by this legislation are members of either largely or fully unfunded defined schemes, there is no fund from which to pay the surcharge. Consequently, this bill provides members with the choice of paying the accumulated debt when 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9394"> they receive their superannuation benefit or paying the impost as it arises. It is a reasonable measure on the face of it; however, once again it brings to the fore the whole issue of unfunded liability and, specifically, the unfunded liability that will have to be met by the federal government in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 13 July 1996, Mr Michael Rice, Managing Director of MJR Consultants, spoke at the superannuation 1996 conference. He noted then that, as at March 1996, the public sector held between $80 million and $100 million in unfunded liabilities, most of which is a liability of the federal government. This figure will continue to sprout and will place a massive drain on future government revenues. In this climate of reform of the aged care and health systems, reforms which encourage individuals to take full responsibility for their own future whenever possible, it is reasonable to ask what the government intends to do to encourage savings schemes that are paid for in full by individuals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commenced by saying that this legislation is largely uncontentious; however, there is one provision that is of concern to the Institute of Chartered Accountants. That provision appears on page 2 of the explanatory memorandum and affects the application of the surcharge to the schemes provided for by this legislation. The explanatory memorandum reads, in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Trustees will have discretion to allow reductions to be applied in a fair and equitable manner, taking various matters into account.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This discretion is necessary in cases where actual benefits are considerably more, or less, than the projected benefit on which the surchargeable contributions&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">and therefore the surchargeable tax&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">has been based.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The institute acknowledges that this bill ensures that a member's benefit for the surcharge cannot exceed 15 per cent of the employer financed component of the benefit accrued in the post&hyphen;August 1996 period. Nonetheless, this provision will cause a substantial inequity between the treatment of private sector and public sector superannuation funds.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ICA makes it clear that, in the case of a defined benefits scheme, which includes many public sector schemes, the contributions reflect a valuable retirement benefit. But if a member departs before he or she reaches retirement age, the member gets a much less valuable benefit. The measures in this bill grant trustees of public sector funds the discretion to accommodate any adjustment that may be required in the surcharge debt in this circumstance. This will give rise to an inequity because a trustee of a private sector fund does not have the same authority. In this instance, the member's benefit is protected, but it would not have been the case should a similar situation arise in the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To highlight this, I borrow from an example used by the Institute of Chartered Accountants, where an employer pays 10 per cent of a member's salary into an accumulated fund. This figure is above that which is required by the superannuation guarantee legislation, but the member must serve a minimum period before he or she gets the excess over that amount of six per cent. As the ICA observes:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The surcharge is based on the whole 10% but, until the minimum qualifying period is completed, the member's benefit is only the accumulation of (the superannuation guarantee) contributions.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Institute of Chartered Accountants is also concerned by the lack of detail about how this discretion can be exercised. It is probable that the government intends for the surcharge debt to be calculated against the benefit that is actually paid, but this is not articulated either in the bill or in the explanatory memorandum. The ICA has indicated that this is a reasonable measure but only if the trustees of private sector funds have the same authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another tax expert in Western Australia has questioned the lack of detail relating to items 63, 64 and 65 of the explanatory memorandum. These items impact on the deduction of a surcharge deduction amount from a transfer value payable to an eligible superannuation scheme. The explanatory memorandum reads:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">If (a) person has a surcharge debt when leaving the scheme, the debt does not become payable until the benefits become payable. Interest will continue to accrue on the amount in the surcharge debt account, until that time. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9395">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">However, there is no mention here about how a fair level of interest payable will be determined, and the member for Gellibrand touched on that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This same tax expert has also questioned the decision to apply the additional 15 per cent tax to the benefits payable to the spouse or orphaned children following the death of a member of a superannuation fund. While the application of the impost may net the government a greater slice of the cake in the short term, it is questionable whether it will have any longer term benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Criticism is also deserved about the lack of content in the financial impact statement in the explanatory memorandum and the total absence of a compliance impact statement. Back in November 1993, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts recommended:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . all future legislation be supported by a taxation impact statement, which details the impact on taxpayers of the legislation, including the total compliance cost, and the extent to which simplification objectives can be achieved.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As Messrs Evans and Walpole of ATAX at the University of New South Wales have noted, that recommendation was accepted by the government of the day on the basis that legislation should not bring about burdens beyond those that are acceptable and necessary. It was also supported by the then opposition. However, it would now seem that that support has been tempered during the transition to the right side of the chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The total absence of a cost impact statement in this legislation is conspicuous for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that the coalition went into the last election with a commitment to reducing the regulatory burden on the business community. The government is fully aware of the significance of its impositions on taxpayers, and yet it has opted to reject the requirement to table an appropriate impact statement in this instance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the principal superannuation surcharge legislation was introduced into this place last year, tax experts agreed that the government's claims of a $500 million gain to revenue were grossly exaggerated. Perhaps the government now concedes that to be true, because the financial impact statement in this 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> explanatory memorandum suggests that the surcharge tax legislation is intended to bring about an `increase in revenue', although no dollar amount is mentioned. So we have gone from a gain to revenue of $500 million to an unquantified increase in revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The financial impact statement goes on to say that the amendments contained in this bill will support that intention; that means, it will provide an increase in revenue. But, once again, the figures that would give weight to the claim have been excluded. Presumably, the government is relying on this additional revenue to balance its books in future, although by what amount is just anybody's guess.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I acknowledged in August last year that it is difficult to quantify the costs of compliance for individual organisations. However, I also noted that, if a government is able to project the cost or gain to revenue, they should be able to estimate the compliance cost to the economy. In this case, it appears that the Treasurer (Mr Costello) cannot even estimate the effects on revenue. The fact that the trustees of those superannuation funds affected by the proposed measures will have to advise the Australian Taxation Office each financial year of the surchargeable contributions paid to the scheme for every member of that scheme will necessarily mean an increase in administration costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the extent of their obligation goes further than that because, once the ATO has advised the trustee of the surcharge amount applicable to each member, the trustee must then pay that amount from the superannuation fund to the ATO and then make the necessary alterations to the member's account. Once again, the member for Gellibrand's criticisms stand. This will generate a substantial increase in the cost of compliance for the trustees, which will almost certainly translate into a cost on all members of funds, regardless of their income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The time has come for the government to do what should already have been done&mdash;that is, substantiate this bill with a detailed cost and financial impact statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One issue that has been of ongoing concern to tax experts and consumers alike has been 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9396"> the treatment of golden handshakes being paid to staff. The original legislation would see the full amount of any such payment that is rolled over into a superannuation fund being subject to the additional superannuation impost. That could cost some individuals tens of thousands of dollars in lost benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the coalition first announced its intention to impose the surcharge, it justified its decision on the grounds that the additional tax would only apply to 300,000 high income earners nationwide. I said at the time that it was probable that many people not originally intended to be caught in its web would be affected by the tax. The application of the additional 15 per cent to golden handshakes is just one example. If the government is serious about fostering an equitable taxation regime, then it would have brought about measures in this bill to ensure that those who have provided for their own retirement are not penalised so comprehensively.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A secondary motivation behind the introduction of the surcharge was to force an increase in our level of national savings&mdash;a commendable objective. But it is ironic then that a recent survey by the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants is reported to have found that 47 per cent of the clients interviewed had reduced their superannuation contributions as a direct consequence of the surcharge. Just as alarming was the fact that 85 per cent of accountants surveyed were of the opinion that the coalition's treatment of superannuation had seen a serious decline in the integrity of the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australians are not good savers. I said during the debate on the surcharge that home ownership would remain the preferred savings option for most Australians and that superannuation will not be used more than it has to be unless people have confidence in the system. The coalition's additional 15 per cent impost did nothing to shore up that sort of confidence; it did everything to rattle it. The measures contained in this bill will confirm in the public's mind that this government is no different to its predecessor when it comes to putting its hand in a very tempting cookie jar.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For constitutional reasons, the Commonwealth is unable to impose a surcharge on certain state superannuation schemes.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The package also includes legislation which amends a number of acts to give effect to the application of the surcharge to members of Commonwealth superannuation schemes, consequential amendments arising from the legislation dealing with members of certain state superannuation schemes, technical amendments to clarify the operation of the surcharge and to improve the administration of the surcharge, and amendments to correct technical deficiencies in amendments made to the original surcharge legislation during its passage through the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the discussion by a number of members in the House, I note that the opposition is supportive of this legislation. Various comments have been made, but generally there is support for this legislation. We welcome that support.

<PARA STYLE="Para">These amendments are similar to the amendments that were moved in the Senate when the legislation was first presented in August, I think, to the Senate&mdash;the original first tranche of legislation dealing with the superannuation contributions and termination payments taxes legislation. The purpose of these amendments is to exempt from the calculation of income certain payments that are received by members of the Australian Defence Forces. These are payments that are received as retention bonuses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Retention bonuses are made available to members of the services for very good reasons of requirement of the government. These are bonuses paid to people in the services to retain in the services skills that are in short supply and individual people who the services have determined are important to be retained. Those individuals are being asked to continue their service in the defence of Australia and, in consideration of their willingness to serve future years, are receiving a financial payment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government will, in the bill before the parliament&mdash;unless it is amended in the way I have proposed&mdash;include those payments as income, which will place virtually all of its recipients over the threshold above which the additional superannuation tax will be incurred. There is no justification for on the one hand asking service personnel to give extra years service and, on the other, hitting them about the head with an extra superannuation tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of notably pilots in the RAAF and in Army, and also air traffic controllers, where there has been an acute shortage for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9398"> some years, the government has actually gone out of its way to entice those people to stay on by offering them a special superannuation bonus. Having offered them a special bonus, it intends to slug their superannuation when they finally get it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No advice is being given to people in the services about the effects on their superannuation of accepting the bonus. It is bad enough that the government is actually doing this, but what is absolutely underhanded is that the government is not even advising the service personnel that, if they do what the government asks them to do and stay on in the service of the defence forces, they are going to get hit with extra tax on their superannuation benefit, which for many people in the services is a fundamentally important condition of service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are not even being given the advice that their superannuation is going to be reduced if they agree to stay on. You have to ask yourself: how honest is that? You have to ask yourself: what would happen if the government actually came clean with those pilots, air traffic controllers and people in other key positions when they tell them, `You do what we ask you to do and stay on and fly a Hercules aircraft or an FA18 for us instead of going off to Qantas or Cathay Pacific and earning big buckets of money, because we want your special skills'? But the government keeps tight&hyphen;lipped about what it is going to do to their superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to understand that these payments that the government is going to include which will take them over the threshold&mdash;which will reduce their superannuation payment because the government is going to grab extra tax from them&mdash;do not actually contribute to their superannuation benefit. Yes, they get a cash payment, they get a bonus with their income, but that bonus is not actually included to improve their superannuation benefit at all. So it is not as though it goes into their income calculation to boost their superannuation benefit and then you take a slice of that. They do not get any superannuation increase out of this money. What they get is extra tax imposed upon them, by virtue 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of this legislation which will strip away some of their superannuation benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government is not willing to support these amendments, they should at least be honest and open with the defence personnel of Australia. When they say to them, `We want you to stay on and we will offer you a bonus,' they should at least be honest and open about it and say, `And, if you accept it, you will go over the threshold and incur an additional tax on your superannuation benefit.' <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A retention benefit is available also to those service personnel who are in the MSBS, which was introduced by the former Labor government in 1991. The scheme provides that people with 15 years service who undertake a further five years service also get a retention payment. That bonus is not given to them just for length of service; it is given to people selectively on the basis that they have skills to contribute that we want to retain. It is probably not as precise a bonus as the one I just referred to with air traffic controllers and pilots&mdash;which are the principal categories, but not the only categories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The simple fact of life is that, in both situations, the government of the day and the chiefs of the defence services identify individuals who we want to retain. In just about every one of the cases they are individuals who have very marketable skills. The reason the government offers them a retention bonus to stay on is precisely that they have marketable skills that see them highly sought after by the private sector. There has been a drain in those key positions within the defence forces.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's approach of providing a retention bonus to keep pilots and air traffic controllers is at best a bandaid. As I have gone around the country, it has been interesting to note that one of the spin-offs is that some people who have not taken or been offered a bonus and who were happy to turn up at work beforehand are now quite disgruntled that their colleagues have been given this bonus and they have not. What you win with one hand you have actually lost with the other hand. The bonus scheme is at best a bandaid, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9399"> short&hyphen;term measure. That is the kindest interpretation you can give to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact remains that the government provides a significant financial incentive to keep those people because they have very marketable skills that the private sector headhunts. If they agree to stay on in the service, this bill will impose upon them an additional 15 cent tax on their superannuation. Many of those people do not currently go over the $70,000 threshold; their wages are not that high. Some will, but many will not. It is precisely those people who you are going to slug with one hand as you try to entice them with the other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People in the defence forces, particularly the ones we are talking about, are not stupid. They may not be aware of the pea and thimble trick you are playing on them in this legislation when they sign on. But one thing is certain: as they draw closer to their retirement from the services, they will become aware of it, and they will think back on the deception that you have perpetrated and will be very disgruntled long-term service personnel. There are enough problems with morale in the defence forces at the moment because of decisions that this government has taken and the ineptitude in a whole range of areas in terms of policy development and structural reform. That ineptitude is causing its own set of problems. If you proceed with this bill to compound that and to further reduce morale in the services, then I promise that you will not have to wait for them to reach retirement age because I will make sure that they know in advance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I seek from the government, if it is not willing to support this amendment, a clear statement about its intentions as to the advice it will provide defence personnel&mdash;those who have already accepted a retention bonus and those they will offer the retention bonus to in the future. I seek from the government a clear commitment that they will provide full details to each of those individuals who is offered a retention bonus of the impact the acceptance of the retention bonus will have on their superannuation and, in particular, the impact this 15 per cent superannuation tax will have on them. In the course of the debate&mdash;if not 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in this chamber, then certainly in the Senate&mdash;I would appreciate a clear statement from the government on that important point of principle. I urge the House to support the amendments.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This aspect of superannuation in the armed forces is only one of a number of other complaints the opposition has with the current superannuation schemes affecting armed force personnel. In the light of the significant job losses that the government is condemning the armed forces to in the next few years from the defence efficiency review, we believe there are significant reasons now why there should be the possibility of those people having the option to choose between the defence force retirement and death benefit scheme or the military superannuation and benefit scheme. As well, there is the issue of the choice to rollover employer MSBS contributions into another fund if the person resigns or is discharged from the ADF.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are issues the opposition has said should be on the agenda. They should be considered by this government. Quite frankly, it is very obvious that the minister involved has a studied disinterest in these matters despite their importance to the armed forces.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The genesis of this particular aspect is that in the 1996-97 budget the Treasurer (Mr Costello) announced that an additional tax would be imposed on `high income earners'. This impacts on people earning $70,000 or more and increases over the income range so that at the $85,000 level they pay the full 15 per cent additional tax. These income levels refer to the concept of adjusted taxable income, which is broadly defined to capture remuneration packaging arrangements which are commonly utilised by high income earners for tax minimisation purposes. It covers more than just a person's salary narrowly defined. It includes, for example, deductible employer superannuation contributions made for the employee's  benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a cynical exercise, the government originally tried to describe the additional tax as a surcharge but has been forced to accept 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9400"> that this is a tax and that the relevant legislation is tax legislation. The original package of legislation imposing additional tax was passed earlier in the year with significant amendments being made by the Senate. Under the legislation, the additional tax became payable from budget night&mdash;20 August 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has now become apparent that the government's original legislation was replete with errors and anomalies. This further package of bills attempts to correct the more obvious of these. The proposals in these bills include the extension of the additional tax to defined benefits superannuation funds and to Commonwealth public sector superannuation schemes, including the military and a number of other areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor believes that the design of the additional tax is ill conceived. It supports, however, the need to address the anomaly whereby high income state and territory public servants, judges and politicians are not currently liable to pay the additional tax whereas other taxpayers on identical incomes do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are significant impacts on ADF personnel. A number of them will be subject to additional tax. The opposition does not propose a blanket exemption but wishes to correct design flaws in the government's package. These design flaws result from the coalition's failure to properly consider the unusual employment conditions associated with military service and its failure to consider the negative impact of its changes on efforts to improve the retention of skilled military personnel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1991, the then Labor government introduced a retention benefit that is payable to personnel who have completed 15 years service with the ADF and who undertake to complete a further five years service. The benefit is paid as a lump sum bonus equal to the person's annual salary and is taxed as assessable income in the hands of the individual. Service personnel up to and including the rank of major&mdash;or equivalent&mdash;also receive an annual service allowance of $6,037 per annum which is included in their salary. A number of additional bonuses are provided to pilots and engineers and air traffic controllers, et cetera. As the member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> indicated, these are the kinds of people that this government supposedly were concerned about retaining in the defence forces rather than encouraging them to leave.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For reasons which I will detail, the opposition's amendment seeks to exempt ADF retention benefit and bonuses from the calculation of adjusted taxable income for the purposes of the additional superannuation tax. It is clear the retention benefit is not a salary packaging arrangement designed with tax minimisation purposes in mind. Since its introduction, it has always been counted as assessable income and is taxed at the appropriate marginal tax rate. As the shadow minister for defence has noted, the retention benefit does not increase the service person's end superannuation benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The retention benefit was introduced to reduce the loss to the private sector of skilled military personnel who have been the beneficiaries of expensive taxpayer funded education and whose retention contributes to the protection of Australia's military preparedness. Whilst the benefit can be substantial and might be seen by some as generous, it is only given in return for a signed undertaking to undertake a further five years service. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> Few other Australians are expected to contract to remain in an employer's service for five years and accept postings as and when the employer requires with associated disruptions to the employment of partners, changes to children's schooling and child care and often exposure to extremes of climate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another aspect of why we have concerns with this is that the Treasurer has said from the outset that the additional superannuation tax was only aimed at high income earners. Indeed, in his 1996 budget speech he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For superannuation contributors with such incomes below $70,000 per annum, there will be no change whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">However, by including ADF retention benefit and service allowance and definition of income, the Treasurer has ensured that the tax will be imposed on ADF personnel who cannot possibly be described as high income earners. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9401">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have no problem with the concept that a brigadier earning more than $85,000 a year should be subject to the additional tax, but let us look at some other examples involving the ADF. A sergeant in the army on the top increment would be receiving just under $41,000 a year, including their service allowance. ADF data shows that 80 per cent of sergeants have between 10 and 20 years service. They are thus the very people who have to periodically consider whether to sign up for a further five years service. Under the government's changes, a sergeant with 15 years service signing up for another five years will be hit by the provisions of the superannuation tax for that year once their base salary, service allowances and retention benefit were taken into account. This is clearly an example of penny&hyphen;pinching at its worst.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, a warrant officer earning between $43,000 and $50,000 a year, depending on the exact level and increment, would clearly be hit by the full 15 per cent superannuation tax in the year they receive their retention bonus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fourthly, the government's position flies completely in the face of the rhetoric of the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop). On 19 September 1996, in response to a dorothy dixer from a coalition backbencher during question time, the minister was heavy in that rhetoric. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I generally want to say that I have found that . . . the former government presided over a decline in morale.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We do not regard the Defence Force as public servants in uniform. We regard them as a very special force of people who give service to this nation and will always be recognised as such by this government.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Specifically, on the question of the retention of pilots, she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we are looking at a number of measures to increase the retention rate of pilots. We have in the budget an allocation of $17 million for retention schemes, and that includes a bonus payment scheme, but we are also looking at a range of incentives which are attractive to ensure that pilots will remain within the RAAF and not be lost at the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> rate that was established under the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I would be happy to hear the minister explain how the imposition of an additional 15 per cent superannuation tax will do anything to improve the retention rate of pilots and how it is part of giving proper recognition to `the very special force of people who give service to this nation'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has a habit of engaging in grand rhetorical gestures but of failing to deliver, telling us about all she is going to do for defence personnel but not even being able to speak on this legislation, which brings ADF retention bonuses and benefits into the Treasurer's 15 per cent superannuation tax, creating an absolute debacle on military medals and failing to develop a coherent defence industry policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Presumably, these are examples of Minister Bishop's good work that she had in mind when she told the magazine <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Defence Report</EMPHASIS> that `the Prime Minister, Mr John Howard, was keen to see her continue in her current portfolio to build on the good work that has already been undertaken'. Indeed, the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts, Senator Alston, was struck by Mrs Bishop's good work. He was so struck that he told the Senate on Monday that she was `an example of someone in whom there were unrealistic expectations' and unflatteringly linked her with other failed coalition messiahs such as Joh Bjelke-Petersen, Andrew Hay and Katherine West.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have here is a serious attack on the retention possibilities of the armed forces in this country. It does fly in the face of that rhetoric that we have heard from the minister so often about how she knows the special requirements and the special needs of the armed forces of this country. Fundamentally, this undermines the efforts of the previous government to retain people who are needed by the armed forces in this country. It is quite disturbing that obviously she has had very little impact with regard to the superannuation debate in the coalition. This is why, unfortunately, it went through to the keeper as far as coalition meetings are concerned and why it 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9402"> will fundamentally mean a very big impost on the armed forces of this country.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It would appear as though the amendments which I have moved on behalf of the  opposition are not going to be supported by the government, even though they deal with the clearest example of retention bonus benefits to defence personnel being unfairly and harshly dealt with under this new superannuation legislation. Given that it would appear as though the most dramatic example of the anomaly that requires rectification is going to be overlooked, I should place on the record a couple of other areas in which allowances are going to be caught by this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly, the retention bonus is the most significant and it is the clearest example where people in the three services, particularly in the Air Force, are being asked to stay on by the government. But there are a number of service allowances where payment is made to people in the services because of the additional hardship that they suffer by virtue of the role that they are in. Some of those allowances can be quite significant because the hardship they endure and the requirements placed upon them are dramatically different to that of other personnel in the services. The two clearest examples of that are the submariners and the people in the Special Air Service Regiment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The simple fact is that submariners quite properly receive an additional increment to take account of the fact that life in a submarine is extremely difficult. It is a hardship to be away from home as long as they are required to. All service on ships, surface ships included, is paid for with an additional increment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Submariners receive an additional payment on top of the surface fleet because life in a submarine takes special qualities. It is a particular hardship and not everybody can endure it. Those people are going to have that payment included by this government in the calculation of their income for the purpose of imposing an additional superannuation tax upon them. The government quite happily allows that to occur.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People in the Special Air Services Regiment, who are highly respected in this parliament by members on all sides and throughout the community, receive additional payment because, unlike others in uniform, they are required to maintain absolute peak capability virtually around the clock. I had the privilege of visiting the SASR a week or two ago and talking to the people there and watching them in some of their training. I have had that privilege on a couple of occasions now. There is no doubt that those people in the SASR are required to maintain a very demanding training schedule, with the physical and mental stress associated with that and with the requirement to shift to other locations literally at a moment's notice for the purposes of their exercise. They are required to maintain that sort of skill, which is not placed upon anyone else in the defence forces. As a result, they quite properly get an additional payment in recognition of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members of the SASR have just had a quite substantial increase in their allowance. I have no doubt that the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop) would want to claim some credit for the increase in the allowance of SASR members. I am not so sure that the minister for defence personnel would want to go out to the SASR and tell those people that, having got that increment, some of them are now going to find themselves losing in their superannuation benefit, not getting more money by virtue of the allowance. As the member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson) pointed out, as with the retention bonus, these service allowances do not contribute to enhancing their superannuation payouts. It is not like their fundamental salary, a percentage of which goes into superannuation; it is on top of that. It is excluded from their superannuation contributions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So they get no gain whatsoever in their superannuation benefit by virtue of those additional allowances. But this government, through this legislation, intends to tax them and actually reduce their superannuation because they happen to be serving in the SASR or because they happen to be submariners. It is a disgraceful situation and it is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9403"> counterproductive. The simple logic of personnel management should tell the government that you cannot expect to fill the ranks of those critical positions if, on the one hand, you offer them more money each week and then, on the other hand, you surreptitiously take it away from them out of their superannuation when they leave the services. It is a counterproductive, foolish course of action to follow. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> It is a very foolish arrangement for the government to try to retain those skills&mdash;as they do with a retention bonus&mdash;and to say to people, `We need you as submariners.' We actually have a shortage of submariners, so we set about spending lots of money to recruit them, giving them this additional bonus on a weekly basis, and then decide that we are going to reduce their superannuation benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before dinner I did say that I would appreciate a response from the government to my plea that, given their apparent unwillingness to support the motion, they at least give an undertaking to this House that they will, in future, ensure that those people in receipt of retention bonuses are given advice&mdash;if they take the retention bonus and do what the government wants them to and sign on for another five years service or stay on as a pilot in the air force or as an air traffic controller&mdash;about the implications for their superannuation. I now add to that a request that the government give a clear undertaking in this House tonight that those people in receipt of service allowances also be given advice that that service allowance will, in fact, be included in the calculation of their income for the purposes of levying a superannuation surcharge tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you will not exempt them as the opposition has sought to do in this amendment, at least be honest with them. Do not go behind their backs because, if there is any group of people in the Australian community whom the government has an absolute responsibility to be honest with, it is the service men and women who are willing to put their lives between harm and you and me and everyone else in this community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth noting that the coalition's defence policy before the last election actually 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> referred to the retention bonuses and said that they would maintain the current arrangements on retention bonuses for ADF personnel. I suppose that is half the truth. I suppose they have kept half the bargain. `Yes, we'll maintain the retention bonus,' say the government. `It's just a bit unfortunate that, for many of you, it will mean that your superannuation payment at the end of your career will be reduced because we're now going to impose a 15 per cent surcharge on you.' And for many that would not have applied, except for the government's insistence that these service payments and retention bonuses count towards income as part of that formula.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I again urge the government to reconsider their position. They had an opportunity when the bill first went through the parliament to amend the legislation to address this anomaly. Because they made so many mistakes with the legislation originally, they now have a second opportunity to amend that legislation. We are giving you that opportunity here in this debate, and I think there will be a lot of service men and women throughout the country who will look eagerly at the government's response.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Words are glib. The assurances and statements of the minister for defence personnel are particularly glib. What you have tonight is an opportunity to put some substance to that and the government can decide in their vote very shortly whether they wish to punish the defence personnel, particularly those in special positions in which we require special skills, or whether they will be honourable with them and exempt them from this tax or at least be honest with them and tell them individually, `This is the impact upon you if you decide to stay on in your important role with us.'</PARA></SPEECH>

That is not true at all. Let us face it, there are lots of people who actually get annual performance bonuses for increased productivity. Are you going to say that people who get bonuses for productivity should not have to pay the surcharge?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then you are going on to say that a person getting commission bonuses based on the level of the person's sales should not have to pay the surcharge. What nonsense. That is the higgledy&hyphen;piggledy sort of administration this country had for 13 years, trying to pick winners here and do a deal there, a special deal for this group and a special deal for that group. You are trying to reimpose that on this government, which has now got the management and administration of taxation and the budget back into balance. You would like to send us back into a $10 billion deficit. That is what you would like to do. The fact is that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> lots of people get different bonuses for a whole range of reasons, and in regard to these sorts of circumstances we want to treat everybody in Australia fairly and equitably. There is no overwhelming reason why retention bonuses should be excluded from the calculation of adjusted taxable income for the purposes of determining surcharge liability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was very interested that the member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) said that these people are not stupid. I agree with that. The fact is that you are saying that these people are not going to be aware, like all other Australians, that their income is going to go over $70,000, so they will not know that this surcharge applies to them. All other Australians will realise, will read the papers, will be taking information, and you are saying that these people will not realise it. I do not think that is the truth. I think these people are very able, competent people who do a great job for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The recently issued information statement sent to all members of the Australian Defence Force included information about the superannuation contributions tax, and we have the opposition over here saying that they are not informed. That is total nonsense. Quite frankly, the argument which has been put by the opposition does not hold water at all. It is populist politics involving sectional interests, and that is about all there was in the argument that was put. It was not about having a taxation system that treated everybody equally and fairly. You are arguing the case that we should not tax people on $70,000 but rather should let those people off. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to honourable members on the other side that we do not support this amendment. There is no plausible reason why you would accept this type of amendment to this legislation. Not only that, but in regard to informing people in the defence forces, the Taxation Office and ComSuper, which administers the military superannuation schemes, will provide members with ongoing information in relation to the superannuation surcharge tax. ComSuper also periodically sends a newsletter to service pay centres on topical issues affecting members' superannuation entitlements. The people in the defence forces are people 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9405"> who are aware of the various matters which will affect their superannuation; I have no doubt about that. As honourable members were saying, they are able people and they would understand the implications of the surcharge tax.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My personal explanation relates to an article in the 12 October 1997 edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun&hyphen;Herald</EMPHASIS>  newspaper&mdash;carried on page 15 of its Sydney edition&mdash;which is headlined `More MPs pay back', and which includes a photograph of me over the caption `Audit: Liberal Kathy Sullivan'. The word `audit' is in heavy print, virtually a subheading to the article. The first paragraph states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Four more Federal MPs have repaid travel allowances as a result of the audit of travel claims.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The fourth paragraph of the article states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">MPs who made recent repayments were:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Queensland Liberal Kathy Sullivan&mdash;$145 for one night in Canberra in March 1997.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Given recent weeks' events relating to parliamentarians' travel allowances associated with allegedly secretive reimbursements of overpayments, I consider these statements to be highly damaging to me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps the journalist whose by-line the article carries, namely, Fia Cumming, read the travel allowance information tabled by the Speaker on Wednesday 1 October and jumped to her conclusions because a $145 debit in my TA payments appears in those records. I say `perhaps', because I do not actually know why this article contains its assertions about me&mdash;at no time has Ms Cumming contacted me on any matter relating to the contents of her article. Not only are her conclusions wrong, the article states as fact a series of events that simply have not happened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The events which did lead to that debit entry are as follows. In late April I received a cheque for my March 1997 travel to Canberra for parliamentary sittings. I immediately realised that I had been paid for one night more than my entitlement. I then contacted the House of Representatives officer who handles these claims, discussed the overpayment with her and sought her advice as to how I should rectify the error.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After the relevant records had been checked, she told me that I should bank the cheque I had received and that when next I submitted a travelling allowance claim, I should note on it that I had been overpaid for a night in March and request that the appro 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="9407"> priate adjustment be made. I followed that advice precisely. However, since Parliament did not sit during April this year, the first opportunity that I had to request the adjustment was two months after the error occurred, that is, when I submitted my travel allowance claim for the May parliamentary sittings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Contrary to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun&hyphen;Herald</EMPHASIS> article's assertion, I have not&mdash;repeat, not&mdash;been required to repay any money `as a result of the audit of travel claims'. The only communication I have ever received from KPMG, the auditing firm, is a letter dated 4 September 1997 which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am able to advise you that there were no unreconciled T/A claims for your travel during 1995-96. Therefore no further action is asked of you.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Far from requiring me to repay money as a result of their audits, I have never received any inquiries or requests whatsoever from them regarding any of my travel claims. Furthermore, I am confident that when my 1996&hyphen;97 claims are examined by KPMG no problems will arise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The $145 debit in question is virtually nothing more than a journal entry which has the effect of keeping scrupulously accurate the official record of the actual dates for which I have claimed and received travelling allowance. I repeat: the error which that debit entry rectified was one which I identified unprompted and which I took immediate steps to rectify, again, unprompted by auditors or anyone else. I seek leave to table a copy of the article from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun&hyphen;Herald</EMPHASIS> and a copy of a letter dated 4 September 1997 to me from KPMG.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the fact that I do not have the full 20 minutes, although it has generously been given to me. I am going to conclude my remarks very briefly, in deference to my many colleagues who wish to speak on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R299">Native Title Amendment Bill</XREF> . I understand the government has indicated I think an unfortunate desire to curtail the total amount of debate on this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make a couple of points this evening that I did not have time to make last night. In the earlier part of my address I said that I thought the attitudes revealed in this legislative package were very unfortunate and reflected the failure of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to concede&mdash;let alone understand&mdash;the importance of land and culture to Aboriginal people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also outlined the key provisions of the bill and indicated that I had a sense of deja vu after what had occurred in my own state when Premier Court attempted to extinguish native title. I am reminded of words of Mr Chaney&mdash;who has had a lot to do with the operation of the native title legislation&mdash;in commenting upon this legislation. Mr Chaney, a former senator and a former Liberal, is someone who has an unstinting commitment to the cause of human rights. He said recently:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I can touch only lightly on land issues, because of my present engagement, as a statutory officer, as a member of the National Native Title Tribunal. But all I want to say about double standards in this area is that the entirely appropriate concern for the property rights of miners, the entirely appropriate concern for the property rights of pastoralists, the entirely appropriate concern for the rights of all citizens to enjoy public reserved lands ought to be matched by a similarly appropriate concern for the proper protection of Aboriginal property rights. Few Aboriginal people see a consistent standard here.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Few people on our side of the House see a consistent standard here. The solutions we 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have offered are contained in this amendment and need to be repeated and underlined. We insist that native title rights are fundamental legal property rights and are entitled to the same respect and protection as other rights of non&hyphen;indigenous Australians. We also insist that it is in the national interest that this legislation balances and reconciles the differences and interests and the reasonable expectations of indigenous Australians and of other major stakeholders. One set is not superior to the other. We also insist that it is in the national interest and in the interests of indigenous Australians that there be maximum possible predictability and certainty, something that is lacking in this act. We also insist on the need to guarantee the constitutional validity of this legislation. Again that is something which is conspicuously lacking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know I have other colleagues who wish to speak, so all I want to do this evening is note that there are solutions available to this government which it is refusing to hear or allow to be heard. The Australian Law Reform Commission has put forward several recommendations which are being assiduously ignored by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In amending the legislation in line with the various principles that the opposition has insisted on, what the government needs to do, first of all, is to ensure that we reconcile the reasonable interests of all stakeholders&mdash;and I emphasise `all'&mdash;without diluting Aboriginal rights and without provoking legal challenges and dispute, a course on which the government has entered at the moment. Secondly, along with a great many other Australians interested in this issue, I urge the government, as we do on this side of the House, in a spirit of decency and of leadership to embrace the spirit of the Mabo and Wik decisions and to realise that native title exists and that co&hyphen;existence of Aboriginal and pastoral interests is not only possible but also desirable and that reconciliation will not proceed without recognising the rightful title to land of indigenous Australians. Nothing less will do.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before getting down to my own thoughts on this legislation, the speech of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) in this second reading 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9410"> debate on the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997, given earlier in the debate, needs to be answered, if only because so many of her views appear to have a superficial appeal and have been given undeserved merit. I believe that she distorts and misleads, misinterprets and divides, at every turn in her speech. There are few facts there and, therefore, rebuttal is difficult, because much of the speech relies on its negative tone and misplaced anger at what she sees as discrimination against the majority.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Her speech began with a series of false premises upon which she built an illogical argument, concluding in a flourish of nationalism. I want to look at some of those premises because I think they are instructive. In her very first sentence, the member for Oxley said that Australia had a choice between being `one people belonging to one nation or many peoples belonging to many nations'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would remind the member for Oxley that, except in the fantasies of Nazi dictators and some of their latter&hyphen;day admirers, a nation is not constituted of pure racial groups but of citizens living within a defined geographical area. In all countries on earth, many different ethnic and racial groups make up each state, and they are governed most successfully by democratic institutions that not only recognise majority rule but also minority rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Almost all conflicts in the world today are internal disputes resulting from the oppression by the majority of minority rights, especially rights of cultural expression or economic advancement. Majorities, of their nature, have power. It is minorities who are always in danger of suffering disadvantage and discrimination. It is too great a discrepancy in society that divides a nation, not the according of rights to minorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Oxley goes on to say that for many years Australia has been divided by multiculturalism. I think this is simple nonsense. By any standards, Australia has been one of the most cohesive, peaceful and harmonious nations on earth. Multiculturalism has enriched the state. Other nations have allowed demagogues to exploit differences and create violent division, usually for political advantage. Australia has had a bipartisan 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> policy that has successfully blended more than a hundred different ethnic peoples into this country. To say otherwise is to extrapolate from isolated, negative incidents a conclusion at odds with the truth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Oxley went on to say that there is a need for the High Court to be put back into `its rightful place of interpreting the law, not creating the law'. This is a naive understanding of the role of the courts in a common law system. The courts are in place to answer questions and settle disputes and they do so, in a common law system, on the basis of both statute and, in the absence of statute, precedent. The application of traditional common law principles which were applied in the Mabo and Wik cases is entirely the business of the courts. To clarify and extend the community's understanding of a legal conundrum, within the confines of precedent, is the task of the courts, and they do it every day. In so far as such clarification changes the nature of the law, courts have always been law&hyphen;makers. They are one of the branches of power, separated from the legislature and necessarily independent but in a sense working in tandem with the legislature.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Oxley also said that international forces&mdash;in other words, the United Nations&mdash;are driving the Aboriginal industry to create a separate nation. She implies an international conspiracy, whereas in fact the negotiation for the Draft Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples has been conducted over a long period of time in public forums and has been widely debated. The statement that either in Canada or in Australia a separate nation is being created through native title is simply not true. Native title, whether in Australia or in Canada, gives remarkably little and certainly not separate statehood.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to note that native title is a form of title within the nation state, as is freehold or leasehold title. And yet native title is a very different form of title from the usual understanding of property ownership inherent in freehold or even leasehold. It must coexist with leasehold and, where there is a conflict, the rights of the leaseholder prevail. Native title holders are in no sense the sole property 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9411"> owners of the land over which they have been granted title. They must share it with the Crown or with the leaseholder, having only traditional rights and limited negotiation rights over what happens on that land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because she chooses to overstate the gains to Aboriginal people offered by the common law recognition of native title, there has been little generosity of spirit or honesty on the part of the member for Oxley on this issue. I would like to quote a former Liberal Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Fred Chaney, on what he saw as the double standard in Australia in relation to property rights. This has been quoted before but I think it bears repeating. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The entirely appropriate concern for the property rights of miners, the entirely appropriate concern for the property rights of pastoralists, the entirely appropriate concern for the rights of all citizens to enjoy publicly reserved land ought to be matched by a similarly appropriate concern for the proper protection of Aboriginal property rights.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I also want to comment on the point made by the member for Oxley in her speech on the plot to create a separate Aboriginal state. Anyone who has followed the development of the concept of self&hyphen;determination from the immediate post&hyphen;colonial days to today would know that the concept has changed. Today it refers to self&hyphen;determination for indigenous or minority peoples within the life of the state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the Draft Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, self&hyphen;determination is defined as the full political participation of indigenous peoples in decision making affecting them, with the provision that it does not imply secession or threaten the territorial integrity of states. Ms Lois O'Donoghue, a former chair of ATSIC, told the 11th session of the Working Group on Indigenous Populations:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Self determination . . . did not imply a suggestion of separatism or secession . . . it is about the right to choose, to have control over one's destiny.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The view of the Canadian observer at the working group in 1993 was that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . indigenous people's right to self&hyphen;determination was on the same basis as that of other people, being granted only within the framework of existing nation states. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Australian government suggested that the draft contain an express limitation on the right so that it could not be detrimental to the territorial integrity of states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Oxley, when speaking to the  Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 , this bill that we are debating tonight, referred to the Canadian agreement, due to come into effect on 1 April 1999, to split the existing north&hyphen;west territories in two and create out of the eastern half a new political subdivision, Nunavut. This agreement, along with a cash settlement of over $Can1 billion over a number of years, was reached only after 16 years of negotiation. It will give the Inuit people direct title to 136,000 square miles and, consequently, self&hyphen;determination. This is a positive initiative, enabling the Inuit people&mdash;racked by social problems, poverty and low levels of formal education&mdash;to take full responsibility for an evolving process of self&hyphen;management. Repeated polls have revealed that a majority of English speaking Canadians, around two&hyphen;thirds, support the concept of self&hyphen;government for indigenous people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, the member for Oxley, with her usual disregard for factual accuracy and reasoned debate, gratuitously infers that a Nunavut&hyphen;like agreement is imminent for Australia&mdash;an agreement that took 16 years to negotiate. She goes on to say that Aboriginal disadvantage can be equated with the disadvantage of other mainstream Australians. For all of the problems which many Australians encounter&mdash;and many are serious&mdash;Aborigines as a group still suffer inordinately greater disadvantage: unemployment of over four times the national average; half to one&hyphen;sixth the number participating in higher education; poor health, with a life expectancy 15 to 18 years less than the general population and infant mortality three to five times the national rate, in addition to indigenous people having very high rates of chronic disability, diabetes and eye disease; and substandard housing, water and sewerage, especially for many remote communities. Perhaps as a consequence of all this, incarceration rates for Aborigines is 27 times the non&hyphen;Aboriginal rate. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9412">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Aboriginal people do not get higher unemployment benefits than other Australians. Unemployed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are entitled to jobsearch and newstart allowances at the same rate as other Australians. Many choose to work for the community development employment program, CDEP, in around 250 communities across the country. The pay is equivalent to or less than unemployment benefits. People on CDEP are treated as wage earners and are thus ineligible for other benefits received by those on income support, such as rent assistance and health concessions. Over 27,000 indigenous people participate in the scheme. Aboriginal people do not receive higher social security benefits than other Australians. In the areas of education and housing, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have access to special benefits in recognition of the fact that they are the most economically and socially disadvantaged group in Australia today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A variety of programs in universities recognise that many people throughout Australia may be disadvantaged in their educational attainment. There are special admission programs for applicants who have suffered long&hyphen;term educational disadvantage due to poverty, disability or severe medical conditions. Special entry programs for indigenous Australians recognise that they are severely disadvantaged in the area of education. It is estimated that only 33 per cent of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students finish secondary school compared to the national rate of more than 77 per cent. Only 17 per cent of indigenous people aged 18 to 20 participate in education compared to 45 per cent of non&hyphen;indigenous Australians. Aboriginal people living in remote communities generally have little or no access to secondary and tertiary education facilities&mdash;and so I could go on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not only the member for Oxley, in her speech, who claims that ATSIC is corrupt and inefficient; I have heard others say it as well. To that claim I reply: if that is the case then it should be audited like all other institutions. It is then up to governments to deal with the inefficiencies or the corruption. However, the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> member for Oxley has again exaggerated. Fred Chaney says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">ATSIC is condemned to failure because it is asked to do too much . . . The truth is that ATSIC is in many areas required to perform most if not all of the functions of State and Local Government but it is not funded adequately to do so. More than one&hyphen;third of the ATSIC budget is spent on work for the dole and a substantial part of the remainder goes in providing services which would normally be provided by State and Local governments. ATSIC has little money and less energy left to tackle the more vital and particularly Aboriginal issues of building community and individual morale, skill and competence.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In the 1996&hyphen;97 budget, ATSIC funding was $959.92 million. Most of that budget is spent on the CDEP scheme, Aboriginal housing and essential infrastructure programs&mdash;services provided to the rest of the community by state and local government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">ATSIC is subject to the usual processes of public accountability applicable to all public sector spending. In October 1996 the special auditor appointed to review accountability within ATSIC funded organisations found that, of the 1,122 organisations reviewed, 95 per cent were cleared for funding. The special auditor issued 60 `not fit and proper' determinations&mdash;five per cent of the organisations reviewed. Of these, most related to late lodgment of financial and management information, late lodgment of acquittal information and failure to lodge project performance records. The problems were linked to the small size of organisations and the need for management training&mdash;not corruption.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, when dealing with matters raised by the member for Oxley, there is the perverse logic in the view that the native title decisions of the High Court or the Native Title Act should have offended against the Racial Discrimination Act. I fail to understand how the most grossly disadvantaged group in our community&mdash;people who have been dispersed, dispossessed and murdered, and whose struggle to reach even the most basic and acceptable standards continues daily&mdash;can have discriminated against the majority by being given limited and often largely symbolic rights over land they formerly held in total.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9413">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, let me turn to other matters concerning this bill. On a personal level, I find myself in a difficult position. For the past six years I have been a member of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, and I am supportive of the process&mdash;that is, of seeking to negotiate a solution that is acceptable to all sides of the argument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a former shadow minister, I visited many communities, and I am very much aware of the different way in which Aboriginal people view land. An Aboriginal person's country forms the basis of their creation stories, religion and culture. Land is the core for relationships between people, past and future generations; an inherent link between kinship, spirituality and custody, as opposed to the European concept of ownership which brings economic power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of my concerns is that, in seeking a solution to the native title issue, we are not placing enough emphasis on the importance of land to its Aboriginal custodians. We have an issue of `guardianship versus ownership', a legal versus moral argument; and an issue that, unless it is resolved with the agreement of all involved parties&mdash;indigenous custodians, pastoralists, miners, all levels of government&mdash;will cost our country billions of dollars in litigation and compensation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Native Title Amendment Bill 1997, as it stands, does not, in my view, provide certainty to all stakeholders. States and territories can determine native title activities&mdash;and, unfortunately, historically their record is poor in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, Mr Deputy Speaker, let me state, in essence, my concerns about this legislation. Apart from the foreseeable difficulties of passing it through the Senate and the enormous cost to the community through compensation claims and litigation costs, I think the perceived outcomes of the Wik decision have been overstated. For many generations on many leases, Aboriginal people have co-existed with pastoralists and have had rights to move over the land. The Wik decision determined that the granting of a pastoral lease did not necessarily extinguish native title; that native title could coexist with the rights of the leaseholder; and that the rights 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of pastoralists prevail over any rights of the native titleholders. The number of pastoral leaseholders who have to coexist with native title holders is relatively small; that is, small enough to successfully negotiate any conflict situations if they arise&mdash;but, it would seem to me, not large enough to justify extinguishment, and all that that entails, of native title on pastoral leasehold land on a large scale basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do have my doubts about this bill. I do have concerns about the unedifying prospect of future litigation&mdash;thereby negating any claims of certainty. And I do have serious concerns about the impact of this legislation on the reconciliation process. Some may say, `Well, in that case why are you going to support the bill?' I must say that I will not vote against the legislation because it seems to me that to do so would be seen as a rather fruitless exercise. But I do believe that, as an expression of my deep concern, it is important that I state my position on the public record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I say, if I were to vote against this legislation, I think the media would use that for other political purposes. But my conscience requires that I place on record my deep reservations about this particular piece of legislation: I believe that it disadvantages further those already disadvantaged, and that it will not provide the results sought so vehemently by the wider community.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me begin by complimenting the member for Aston (Mr Nugent) for the courageous speech he has made here tonight and the fact that he has recognised&mdash;as I am sure other members in his party would have recognised&mdash;that the current legislation, the Native Title Amendment Bill, will not achieve the results which the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has maintained it will achieve; it will create more problems for Australia both within the nation and internationally. Mr Deputy Speaker, in support of that fact, you only had to see tonight's news reports of some British and European members of parliament talking already of the possibility of boycotting the 2000 Olympics because of the incredible reputation we as a nation are gaining in relation to these matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9414">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me make it clear: we in the Labor Party do not agree with such a boycott. But those who think that we can, as a nation, simply put our head in the sand and make determinations that are contrary to justice for our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are mistaken. They know, in fact, that this will rebound on us as a nation. We ought to be very conscious of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I am very happy to be participating in this debate on the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997. It is a debate which I think will be of historic importance to our nation. Many of the detailed issues have been discussed by my colleagues in the Labor Party. I believe that the arguments against the Prime Minister's 10&hyphen;point plan, especially as that plan is embedded in this legislation, are overwhelming. It is said that the government has failed to heed not only the views of the indigenous people and of the opposition parties, but also the thought out contribution of its own Australian Law Reform Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have already heard in this chamber about the shenanigans which have occurred in trying to hide from the public the views of the Australian Law Reform Commission. Those views are very important: they emphasise not only the injustices in this matter but also the fact that what will happen is that, rather than this legislation resolving issues, we will have a greater number of legal issues, a greater number of constitutional issues and a greater number of issues before the High Court than we had before. I do not know why the Prime Minister has not listened to the government's own Australian Law Reform Commission. But, never mind, that is the way in which things are moving with this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of the reasons put forward by the Prime Minister in supporting, in effect, a form of extinguishment of native title are bogus. What we have here is not an intellectually rigorous attempt to come to grips with the issues, but rather an exercise intended to assuage the unjustified concerns created in the minds of pastoralists and other non-indigenous Australians, and to please these people. The Prime Minister's approach talks about `swinging the pendulum back' towards 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a more balanced view&mdash;I saw him on television talking about `swinging the pendulum back'&mdash;as if the native title legislation of 1993 and the Wik decision have been too generous or too fair to the Aboriginal people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where is the Prime Minister coming from? What sort of sense of history does he have, if he thinks that the native title legislation and the Wik decision are too fair or too generous? Obviously, he does not understand what has happened historically in relation to the extraordinary fate of the Aboriginal people. This extraordinary statement which has been made by the Prime Minister has unfortunately been promulgated enthusiastically in the media, thereby creating the impression that the indigenous people of this country are now being excessively compensated&mdash;excessively compensated&mdash;for past sufferings. What an absurdity!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This insidious propaganda line has even led to a situation where people living in suburban blocks in the cities feel threatened by native title. That is how far the nonsense has extended, and nothing could be further from the truth. The idea of coexistence between the rights of pastoralists and the rights under native title is certainly an idea that can work and must be made to work if we are to have justice in this society. The fundamental reason why this is so has to do with the dramatic role which the land plays in the very structure of Aboriginal culture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said before in this parliament, the fundamental philosophy of the Aboriginal people is a world view and a metaphysical system in which the spiritual elements of life are intertwined with the physical elements of life through the medium of the land. It was very interesting to hear the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) in his contribution yesterday say that land was unimportant to Aborigines. Where is he coming from? There is not a single Aboriginal culture that does not hold the land as sacred and dramatically important. He does not know what he is saying. He was completely wrong. The whole contribution was a disgrace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Land is fundamentally important to the very existence of Aboriginal people and the way they conceive themselves in the world. This 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9415"> has been understood for many years. In the book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">In the World of the First Australians</EMPHASIS>, Kathryn and Ronald Berndt had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In comparison with many others, and certainly in comparison with Europeans, the Aborigines were a deeply religious people. Religious feeling was manifested through ritual observance and through mythic expression&mdash;and, essentially, taken for granted. And an intrinsic part of it was a deep emotional attachment to the land, their own land. The whole countryside was full of signs and clues that were directly and indirectly relevant to their lives. It was made familiar and intimate to them through mythic beings who were believed to be manifested at specific sites, always present and approachable through the medium of ritual. There were eternal or enduring elements, underlining continuity sustained through religious practice. At one conceptual level, everything was brought together into one expanded sociocultural environment. The deities were manifested predominantly through man, and other living things and other features were selected as intermediaries or symbolic representations: all drew on the same life force.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This point about land is reinforced by many Aboriginal persons who have expressed themselves quite emotionally on this matter. For example, an Aboriginal Uniting Church minister is quoted in the book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Certain Heritage</EMPHASIS>  as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The land my mother. Like a human mother, the land gives us protection, enjoyment, and provides for our needs&mdash;economic, social and religious. We have a human relationship with the land: mother&hyphen;daughter, son. When the land is taken from us or destroyed, we feel hurt because we belong to the land and we are part of it.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Yunupingu, a former member of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation and a prominent Aboriginal leader, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The land is my backbone . . . I only stand straight, happy, proud and not ashamed about my colour because I still have land. I can paint, dance, create and sing as my ancestors did before me.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think of land as the history of my nation. It tells me of how we came into being and by what system we must live. My great ancestors who lived in the times of history, planned everything that we practise now. The law of history says that we must not take land, fight over land, steal land, give land and so on. My land is mine only because I came in spirit from that land, and so did my ancestors of the same land . . . My land, is my foundation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Our responsibility as a nation for the destruction of so much of Aboriginal culture over the last 200 years is clear and undeniable.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In destroying much of the culture of Aborigines through our treatment of them, we totally undermined the basis of their identity as a people. The majority of our indigenous peoples became lost souls in this process, having lost touch with their traditional roots and the traditional links with those lands that provided them with their identity. Unfortunately, we cannot restore all this. We cannot bring back the totality of the richness of the cultures that we have destroyed, but we have an overwhelming moral imperative to do a lot more. The Mabo decision and the Native Title Act provide us with the opportunity to take concrete steps to redress these historical wrongs. That is what we did in bringing down that legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Wik decision threw out a further challenge to us: to be a generous society, to show compassion, to show the world that we are prepared to do something to remedy the wrongs we have done to the indigenous people of this country. Instead, how have we responded as a society? Our media, to their utter disgrace, have promulgated sensational lies and created totally unfounded fears in the minds of the population. They have tried to create the impression that the indigenous people of this country are now being excessively compensated for past sufferings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This insidious propaganda line, promulgated in particular by the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) and the member for Kalgoorlie and others but unfortunately supported indirectly through this bill, has even led to a situation where people living in suburban blocks in the cities feel threatened by native title. Many of the points put forward in the Prime Minister's 10&hyphen;point Wik plan, as I mentioned, are bogus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say something about this bogus plan. The Prime Minister's approach suggests that there cannot be coexistence between the rights of pastoralists and the rights of indigenous people under native title. As I have mentioned, this is an idea that can work. The High Court, when it delivered its judgment on 23 December 1996, said that the grant of a pastoral lease does not necessarily extinguish all native title rights. How are you going to get around that? You can try whatever you 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9416"> like about extinguishment, but you will not get around that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The High Court said that pastoral leases do not give exclusive possession to the pastoralists. It said that native title rights continue at the same time that the land is subject to a pastoral lease. Whatever you do with this 10&hyphen;point plan, you will not get around the fundamental point of the High Court's pronouncements. What you will do by this extinguishment process is simply reopen a whole process at the High Court. Even if we pass this legislation unamended, we will have to go back to the High Court, because it will be challenged for its constitutionality and in terms of the Wik determination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rather, we could have a process of conciliation, negotiation and discussion between ourselves and the indigenous people in which we work out a coexistence arrangement for both the rights of pastoralists and the rights of indigenous people under native title. The High Court itself explained that a native title holder could not exclude the holder of a pastoral lease from the area of that pastoral lease or restrict pastoralists from using the lease area for pastoral purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, a native title holder would not be able to do anything which interfered with the ability of the pastoralists' livestock to take advantage of the pasture and the water resources of the land; which interfered with the pastoralists' privacy on the homestead; and which interfered with the pastoralists' right to build fences, gates, windmills and other improvements on the land. This was in the determination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under these circumstances there is no reason why we should seek to extinguish any rights under native title in order to protect pastoralists. Their interests can be protected in a fair system such as that which the indigenous working group have suggested to the parliament. They have produced a statement titled `Coexistence&mdash;Negotiation and Certainty: Indigenous Position in Response to the Wik Decision and the Government's Proposed Amendments to the Native Title Act, 1993'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They have put forward a number of key principles&mdash;for example, the principles of non-discrimination as set out in the Racial 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Discrimination Act 1975 which they say are binding on Australia under CERD and which under international law must be fully respected. It is absolutely correct. If we have a situation in which this act goes through and its challenge is contrary to the Racial Discrimination Act, and indeed to the High Court's own determination on Wik, we will be ridiculed internationally because we have produced the Racial Discrimination Act and we have signed international agreements relating to these matters, yet we are going to produce legislation that is challengeable on this basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We really are in a very difficult position which we need not be in had the government been prepared to discuss the matter seriously. Instead, the Prime Minister went through a nonsensical process, and the Aboriginal leaders simply could not believe the treatment they received from him. He simply produced his own dogmatic plan and was not prepared to really get into serious discussions and negotiations with our indigenous people to achieve a possible compromise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The indigenous working group's statement is extremely sensible. It does not say, `All of the native title claims of the indigenous people have to be met.' It says, `Let's have a look at them. Let's have a sensible process. Let's have a process of discussion and negotiation in which those who are making native title claims and the pastoralists and the miners can come together and work out agreements through a negotiated process.' Instead, the Prime Minister has sought to get rid of this whole process and substitute it with his Wik plan. Let us face it: even the Leader of the National Party (Mr Fischer) has described it as bucketfuls of extinguishment. What is that supposed to mean? It means extinguishment of native title rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We then are told by others that it is not really going to extinguish anything. The reality is that the indigenous people of this nation have a lot to fear from this legislation because it will extinguish so much. It has swung the pendulum back all right: it has swung the pendulum back completely in the opposite direction&mdash;against the Aboriginal people. The Prime Minister ought to be ashamed as leader of this country for putting 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9417"> forward these proposals and achieving this kind of result.</PARA>

In a lot of instances, the information that has been put forward is erroneous and, in some cases, probably deliberately mischievous. That is very sad because this is an issue that is very important to this country. It is an issue that needs to be resolved and resolved quickly if we are going to have the reconciliation that a lot of us and a lot of members in this House have spoken about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund. We have heard a number of submissions from a number of different groups on this particular subject. The problem that raises its head is the fact that while the High Court has made two decisions&mdash;one in Mabo and one in Wik&mdash;there are still a lot of questions that have not been answered.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the fundamental questions&mdash;and I was interested to hear the member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) and the member for Aston (Mr Nugent) talk about this&mdash;is the access to land and hunting, gathering and ceremonial rights. There seems to be a myth abroad that that is what the High Court decided. The High Court did not decide that. In fact, it said in Wik that just because a grazing lease had been granted over that land&mdash;and I might say that both of those leases are not current leases; one I do not think was taken up and the other was abandoned&mdash;it did not necessarily extinguish native title. It did not say what native title was and it did not say on what lands it might apply. That is the fundamental problem that we have in this whole debate. I have listened to a lot of evidence before the native title committee that has assumed a lot of things. Unfortunately, there is misinformation being peddled&mdash;I suspect by some members of the opposition&mdash;about this whole area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The facts are that this parliament has a responsibility. There has been criticism of the High Court making law, which is not its responsibility. But if this parliament abdicates its responsibility then it will be left to the High Court to make law. We do have a responsibility here to try to clarify and interpret the decisions of the High Court. There is no doubt that there is an industry out there that has been developed of professional people&mdash;lawyers, anthropologists and even planners&mdash;who I do not think have a real interest in solving this particular problem but are certainly trying to extend the boundaries of the High Court decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, we have even heard evidence from some of the Aboriginal leaders that they do not believe the High Court is talking about hunting, gathering and ceremonial rights on land where it has not been extinguished. They believe something greater. Only last week in Cairns, Mr Pearson, when questioned, said that he believed native title was prime title, that it took primacy over crown. That is quite different to some of the arguments that have been put forward in this parliament. You can understand some of the concerns out there in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9418"> the community when these types of suggestions are put forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had evidence on two occasions from Aboriginal leaders who have said they believed native title meant that they owned the land, they owned the minerals, they owned the water and they owned the air space. That is obviously a belief amongst certain people that is quite contrary to some of the argument that is being put forward by the opposition and others as to what native title is really about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the 10-point plan is endeavouring to do is to, in many ways, codify and take what we believe to be the High Court's decision and clarify some of the unanswered questions. When the committee has asked how long it might take the High Court through case law to clarify this particular issue, the answer has been that it will take at least two decades. I put to you that this country cannot wait two decades to decide this particular issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Native title is an issue suddenly arising because there is no doubt the first governments of this country believed they were acting in good faith and believed they were abiding by the world law at the time of allocating land. There is no doubt the Aboriginal people were dispossessed. It was sometimes a very brutal dispossession. There is no doubt about that, and I do not think that is new to Australia or any other country. In fact, my forebears come from the south of England. I put it to you that they were probably dispossessed three or four times. So it is nothing new in the history of countries for peoples to have been dispossessed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I admit that even today the Aboriginal people are a disadvantaged group within our community, and we should be doing everything we can to try to help them. I do believe there is an issue building up in this country whereby people are giving them a hope that will not be achieved. There will be very great disappointment when the High Court does come down or clarify some of these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the 1993 act was obviously put forward in good faith to try to address the issues at that particular time, there is also a rewriting of history by many people at the present time. If you go back and look at the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> quotes that came from the then Prime Minister, from Mr Pearson, from Rick Farley, who was representing the National Farmers Federation at the time, and from the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans) when he was in the Senate, there was a clear understanding that there was a bit of horse trading going on in the 1993 act. Groups were got together by the then Prime Minister and others and told, `Look, we have to get some compromise on this particular issue.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was a clear understanding at that particular time that, in give and take, the act was going to give extinguishment of native title on pastoral leases. You only have to read the quotes to get that indication very clearly. It is history, of course, that the Wik decision came down and said that it did not necessarily mean that, and we have to accept that. No-one is trying to overrule the court's decision. This bill is not trying to overrule the court's decision; it is accepting what the High Court has said and is trying to clarify it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much has been said about the comment of the Leader of the National Party (Mr Anderson) about there being bucket loads of extinguishment. I go through the bill and ask myself, `Where are these bucket loads of extinguishment?' They are not in the bill. In evidence we have before the committee, people cannot substantiate where these extinguishments take place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt there can be a conflict between two titles. What the bill is saying is that if an upgrading does occur on a lease&mdash;and usually it is only a portion of a lease on which upgrading occurs&mdash;and because of that upgrading there is exclusive possession, then that will naturally override the native title rights and compensation must be paid. That is an area where you have two conflicting titles. But under the constitution, because there is a property right denied, they have to be compensated, and the bill takes note of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is the issue of revival. If we look at the quotes from former Senator Evans in the debate in the Senate in 1993, he made it very clear that in his understanding native title could not revive after title had been granted on a piece of land. If they are about the only 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9419"> two areas that you could talk about, there may be some semblance of the fact that native title has been extinguished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most people agree that the 1993 act is not working. In fact, the former government had amendments before this parliament before the election, admitting that the 1993 act needed amendment. If you look at some of the evidence given by Aboriginal people, they say that they believe that the act is not working in many ways. In fact, there are a number of competing claims. Because of the fact that a belief has been built up that this is to do with money and that a native title claim gives some right to money, there are a number of Aboriginal people&mdash;brothers and sisters&mdash;claiming the same land. That is plainly ludicrous and has to be resolved. Aboriginal people agree with that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn to the issue of access. No-one is trying to deny Aboriginal people access to land for their religious or ceremonial beliefs or rights. In fact, even in Queensland, where there is not a right of access under the present legislation, there have been agreements between pastoralists and Aboriginal people to have access to that land. I believe that those voluntary agreements are the way we should go. This act agrees and puts in place a regime whereby you can have these voluntary agreements whereby people can have access to the land. No-one is trying to deny them that. It is a cruel hoax for the opposition to go out there and say that these people are to be denied. They are not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many areas in this bill that are just trying to amend the previous 1993 act to make it workable. One area is the right to negotiate, which at present occurs twice. For example, in mining instances, at the mining lease stage there is a right to negotiate and then if you go ahead and open up a mine, there is another right to negotiate. I argue that native title rights do not change from the time that you go from a lease to a mine. Yes, there is disturbance. That is the same with any property owner; he has to be compensated for disturbance. No doubt, mining companies have to take note of heritage sites, but that can all be agreed in the one process. There do not have to be two processes. It can be 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> streamlined to ensure that that can all be taken into account in due process. I think that that obviously is a very sensible amendment to try to overcome some of the delays and frustrations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of the day, if we do not have these developments and if we do not have industry, whether it be grazing or mining, none of us in Australia can enjoy the standard of living that we have today and the benefits that accrue from that. Whether we are of European descent, Asian descent or Aboriginal descent, none of us can enjoy those rights, so it is important that the country itself is allowed to develop and benefit from the gains that certainly come from that industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, I am saddened by some of the debate that is taking place on this particular issue. Having grown up in the country and spent a lot of time with Aboriginal people, I know their aspirations. Their aspirations are no different to anyone else's. There are 18 million people in Australia. You cannot go back to the time when Aboriginal people roamed this country. Unfortunately, you cannot turn back the clock. It is  one of those things where we have to look to the future. There is no doubt in my mind that the future is not going to be spent squabbling over native title. The High Court has decided that there is a remnant common law right. This parliament is recognising that right. There is no doubt in my mind that we now have to deal with it. It is a difficult and emotional issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are all sorts of furphies floating around. It is very disappointing to see some of them&mdash;for instance, the exaggeration over the possible upgrading of leases. That has always been the right under all state government regimes. Lessees have always had the right to apply to upgrade. There is nothing new in this legislation. It has always been there. The exaggeration that people are going to go out there and upgrade and freehold and deny Aboriginal people rights is plainly wrong and mischievous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also have the furphy floating around that this in some way will benefit the National Party or members of the coalition who come from the country. To my knowledge, there are 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9420"> only two members of the government who might have some interest in leases, yet the opposition has gone out there and talked about 28, which is plainly a lie. All of this emotion and nastiness that has been put around the place to try to  push this particular issue is not gaining any credit at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should look at foreign ownership. It has been very interesting to take evidence from the state governments because there is this myth being peddled that these great areas of Australia are owned by foreign interests. In fact, in New South Wales there is very little. If you go across Australia, somewhere between two and three per cent of the land mass is owned by foreign interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The great majority&mdash;99 per cent and more&mdash;of the lessees in Australia are Australian families. They have a problem at present because of the uncertainty that we have surrounding this particular debate. The problem they have is common to anyone when you have uncertainty, particularly with financial institutions. We received evidence the other day of cases where leases are considered unsaleable because of the uncertainty surrounding this. While they will not come out and say it publicly, banks are saying, `We're not real certain about the title that you hold over this particular land', and they are not giving finance to people to carry on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This country cannot carry on this way. We have to resolve this. There is no doubt that this parliament, as I said earlier, has a responsibility. We are the law makers, we are the people who can pass laws in this country to ensure certainty. It is not about dispossessing Aboriginal people, it is about certainty. It is about trying to clarify a new law&mdash;a new property right&mdash;found by the High Court which in fact conflicts with some of the property rights that have been granted in this country. I think that this 10&hyphen;point plan goes a long way to resolving many of these issues. Might I say that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has sat down with all interest groups to try to resolve this particular problem&mdash;despite what people might say. It is a very thorny problem, as I have said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another issue that has gained quite a lot of interest in the hearings that we have had 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> concerns schedule 4. Schedule 4 relates to a number of leases that the crown law officers of the states and the crown law office of the Commonwealth have sat down about to try to narrow the areas that are at odds. These leases are considered, after reading the leases&mdash;and the Wik decision made it fairly clear that, if exclusive possession was granted, then that would have an influence on native title&mdash;to be exclusive leases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a lot of discontent on both sides about this. On one side we have the advisers and the Aboriginal people saying that some of these leases should not have been included. On the other side we have leases that have been left out, and most states are dissatisfied with the fact that a number of leases have been left out. The ones that come to mind quickly are the pastoral leases in western New South Wales. As lands minister in New South Wales, I was always given the advice that those leases were next to freehold. But because the words are not clearly there in the leases, the law officers have said they cannot include them in schedule 4. In the evidence that we have received it is fairly clear that the law officers have been meticulous in going through these leases to see whether in fact they consider the words to say `exclusive possession'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, I think the plan has been very thorough in trying to resolve some of these issues, trying to clarify issues, trying to cut down the delays that we might have in trying to take all this through the High Court. I have been very interested in some of the comments from the opposition because it seems to me that what they are saying is that this parliament should butt out and the High Court should run this country. I do not believe that is the responsibility of the High Court. Certainly, the High Court is there to define law, to give decisions on statute law, but it is not its job to run the country. It is this parliament's job to run the country, it is this parliament's job to try to clarify law, it is this parliament's job to make law. I believe this 10&hyphen;point plan is certainly trying to do that in a very fair and a very honourable way. I congratulate the Prime Minister for bringing it forward. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset, I would like to indicate my congratulations to the member for Aston (Mr Nugent) for a truly remarkable contribution to this debate on the Native Title Amendment Bill. His speech showed tremendous courage and his contribution is one which I will take with me beyond my parliamentary career.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The contribution of the member for Page (Mr Causley) was, unfortunately, quite disappointing. He indicated that the government's desire is to resolve these matters and to resolve them quickly. All the academic debate indicates that this bill will do nothing of the sort. It will complicate and delay any sensible resolution of matters which should be resolved through a consensus process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He indicated, quite mischievously, in a scaremongering fashion that the banks&mdash;he will not say publicly how he gets his information and I do not know&mdash;are not prepared to lend in respect of pastoral leases. He is well aware that the banks are on the record as saying that they have never lent on the basis of the proprietary value of the land itself for pastoral leaseholdings. They have always lent on the basis of capital improvements and stock on that land and they have said that nothing has changed since the Wik decision. That is part of a scaremongering tactic being advanced by those in the conservative ranks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He said that it is the job of this parliament to run the country, which no doubt is true, but he said it offensively in the context that the High Court should butt out. That is offensive. It is the job of this parliament to run the country, but to run it in accordance with constitutional principles that we have inherited from the Magna Carta and that have been worked through by our constitutional founders consistent with those principles. It is offensive in the extreme to even suggest that the High Court have purported to introduce legislation. They have construed legislation against those fundamental principles which many decent men and women have died face down in the mud for. They are guardians of those fundamental liberties and principles. That comment was offensive in the extreme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government's attitude is not only demonstrated in its propaganda of controlling 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the source of information but also demonstrated most clearly in its approach to the Australian Law Reform Commission, which gave a very learned, thorough and thoughtful analysis of this legislation. Rather than admitting that their advice was on the table as a contribution to the debate, this government has sought to suppress that information. That itself is bad government and is offensive and insulting to the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the legislation itself, the Labor Party has indicated that it would support legislation to provide legal certainty to pastoral leaseholders. It has indicated that it would be prepared to support legislation to refine and clarify aspects of claims under the Native Title Act. But the ALP's position is fundamentally based on a bottom line of ensuring respect for the native title of Aboriginal Australians. Native title is a common law right based on Aboriginal occupation and use of this land for some 30,000 years. What this government effectively seeks to do is reinvent history to determine that 200&hyphen;odd years ago it was an unsettled continent. It cannot reverse history. It was in fact a settled continent, settled by an ancient race recognised internationally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Pastoral leaseholders may well have been disappointed that the High Court confirmed in the Wik case that their leases were something other than proprietary rights. But the facts of the matter are that the leases were the leases as contained in the terms of the leases. They are licences to graze hard&hyphen;hoofed animals on vast tracts of land. Usually, indeed, they are arid tracts of land capable of sustaining very few stock; sometimes as few as one animal per 50 acres. In the Wik case itself, the history of the pastoral leases was analysed in terms of their origins from the occupation by squatters and how regulations had to be in place to clarify the position of those squatters, after they started to develop industry on the pastoral leaseholdings, to actually invest in infrastructure and go about the business of developing the land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the leasing arrangements are in that context. The leases never had the intention of giving and have never given the leaseholders a proprietary right. Indeed, given the massive 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9422"> tracts of land involved, it would be completely untenable to give so much of Australia to so few individuals. Seeking to literally give such vast tracts of land to so few individuals would remove the ability of all Australians to have an input to what is developed on that land. For instance, Australians generally, through their governments, would lose the ability to ensure that unsustainable land uses such as broad scale land clearing, intense irrigated agriculture, native forest logging and unregulated tourism do not occur. If pastoral leases were simply handed over to so few individuals, Australians would lose that input. In short, the land of Australia is part of the heritage of all Australians, and elevating the status of pastoral leases to private proprietary rights would effectively deny all Australians, not just Aboriginal Australians, their heritage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of addressing whether this legislation will achieve the result that is sought by the government, one does not need to read the opinion of legal scholars. Quite clearly, it is a detriment to the Aboriginal people, just as much as it would be if anyone was to march into one or other of our houses and deny that we had a proprietary interest in that entitlement. The legislation is fundamentally flawed from a constitutional point of view, and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) has made an excellent contribution to that aspect of the debate, as indeed has the shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs, the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham), who has just entered the chamber. I think the argument that they advance is unassailable, that quite clearly it will be determined by the High Court of Australia that the race power contained in the constitution can only be used to the overall benefit of the Aboriginal race. It will therefore fail under the race power. Indeed, a Canadian royal commission examined a not dissimilar situation in that country and they determined in that case that the government had a fiduciary obligation to the native inhabitants. That reasoning, I am sure, will be consistent here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Aside from the race power, the other avenue of potential power is the international affairs power. It is clear from Victoria v. The Commonwealth that the domestic law must be 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> consistent with any international treaty upon which it is based. This legislation impliedly repeals those provisions of the Race Discrimination Act which prevent happening something which the member for Kennedy erroneously advanced as being possible, that is, states cannot, as a result of a High Court decision in a case involving the Western Australian government, upgrade pastoral leases to override native title because by doing so they are discriminating against the Aboriginal race. That cannot occur. But this legislation, in impliedly repealing those provisions of the Race Discrimination Act, inconsistently with international treaty obligations which offend against the principles relating to the construction of the foreign affairs power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I underline that point with a question by Hal Wootton, a member of the Native Title Tribunal. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What do you do if you want to acquire somebody's property? Do those who want to acquire it get together on their own&mdash;someone used the word conspire here&mdash;how to take it off them? Or do they go and make an offer, negotiate in other words. If it were anyone except Aboriginals the answer would be obvious to all.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is a shame the government does not come out quite clearly and say what it is doing, that is, discriminating against the Aboriginal people. It is about compulsory, non&hyphen;consensual extinction of clearly identified native title rights. Not only does this bill actually extinguish native title in circumstances of past inconsistent usage; it also permits future Commonwealth, state and territory governments to upgrade pastoral leases so that extinguishment occurs in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government itself has indicated that blanket extinguishment would give rise to massive compensation payments, so it has tried to do it by delay and subterfuge. Nonetheless, it is still putting in place a regime for that to occur. On the authority of Koara's case, compensation is not simply the monetary value of the property. Quite clearly, that compensation must have regard to the cultural significance and resource significance of the land to the Aboriginal Australians. So this government is casting upon taxpayers generally, by a philosophically driven piece of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9423"> legislation, the cost of paying a massive compensation bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill fails to recognise that the international community regards Aboriginal culture as very much part of Australia's culture. The reality is that, after the lessons of Nazism and apartheid, the international community regards racism with complete and utter abhorrence. There is no question that Australia will pay very dearly indeed if it is perceived by the international community as racially discriminatory, particularly against its black indigenous people. It was referred to earlier tonight, for instance, that there have been comments that European countries&mdash;not black African countries&mdash;are looking very seriously at whether they will participate in the Olympic Games if this legislation goes through. That would be a real tragedy for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is discriminatory because it seeks to bestow special opportunities and privileges on one group of Australians at the expense of a racial group, namely Aboriginal Australians. Under this bill they can be forced to give up their land against their will, despite the High Court determining that they have native title over the land. I recall a speech by the member for Kennedy which seemed to have the music of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Twilight Zone</EMPHASIS> playing in the background where he suggested that claims of native title were something akin to some sort of communist plot. The reality is that the High Court has recognised the proprietary right of Aboriginal people and it is this government that is doing what authoritarian governments do: simply attempting to take over and negate the proprietary rights which the High Court has determined clearly exist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unquestionably this is discriminatory legislation and it is repugnant to the majority of decent, fair-minded Australians. Further, it is complete and utter hypocrisy that on 30 October 1996 this parliament reaffirmed its commitment to the rights of all Australians to enjoy equal rights and to be treated with equal respect regardless of race, colour, creed or origin. How can Australians have faith in this parliament when it seeks to regard its own motions with such disdain as is demonstrated by this bill?</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Until we learn to treat the Aboriginal inhabitants of this nation with respect and to afford them the same rights as all other Australians in accordance with fundamental, constitutional and moral principles, then we are diminished as a nation and in the eyes of the world. Worse still, in terms of our own self&hyphen;respect we will have not much to be proud of and much to be ashamed of.</PARA></SPEECH>

Each of us brings to this debate our own individual perspective. Much has already been said concerning this most controversial bill which is before the House tonight. Emotions are running high, with both sides of this place seemingly concreted into positions on totally opposite sides of the spectrum, and there appears to be little chance of agreement. This saddens me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a member of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund since its inception in 1994 as a result of the Native Title Act, I have wandered across this nation listening to the many divergent opinions put forward by all those who have been involved with the issue of native title&mdash;indigenous people throughout the country, pastoralists in the many states and territories, people with mining concerns, local governments, state governments and ordinary citizens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are views as to the effectiveness or otherwise of the bill in its original form. There are views as to the initial Howard amendments, the so-called exposure draft. There are views concerning the High Court Wik decision and finally the Howard 10&hyphen;point plan and the Native Title Amendment Bill that we are discussing here tonight. In my honest and humble opinion this bill is a watershed in our nation's history. If we do not get this sensitive issue right this time around, then conflict and social dislocation the like of which we see so frequently overseas on our nightly television reports will occur surely here in Australia.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9424">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not intend to speak for long tonight to canvass the issues raised by all sides in this debate. The joint committee is shortly to present its report on this very bill and I hope to speak to this report at greater length later on this week. But several things are clear to me. This government, in its attempt to clear the uncertainty generated by the initial Native Title Bill, the Brandy case and the Wik judgment, has been unswervingly pursuing the 10&hyphen;point plan and these amendments, which in my mind will generate far more uncertainty for all concerned and will generate a bitterness that will linger long in our nation's history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I listened with an open heart as a member of the joint native title committee to the concerns of the young pastoralist in Broome the other week as he spoke at length of his anguish at not being able to proceed with his plans to develop his pastoral lease. I also listened to the Aboriginal man who took up a piece of paper and said so accurately to our committee, `I don't care how many black words you write on this white piece of paper. This land has always belonged to my people&mdash;to my father and his father before him.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have listened as a layman to the conflicting legal arguments put by those representing the indigenous people, the various levels of state and local government, the pastoralists and the mining companies. I have listened as members of the committee have argued about the solution to this vexing question. I have honestly been dismayed to hear members in this place speak on this issue as if it is all black or white&mdash;that, because the government have the numbers in this place, God is on their side. I might sound naive and an idealist&mdash;it must be the teacher in me&mdash;but I implore the government to look very closely at what they are proposing to do through the implementation of this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look closely at what we on this side are putting forward in the second reading amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans). Let us look closely at the points raised by our amendment. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) native title rights, including on pastoral leases, are fundamental legal property rights, acknow 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ledged and upheld as such by the High Court, and entitled to the same respect and protection as the property rights of non&hyphen;Indigenous Australians: any amendment of the Native Title Act in response to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Wik</EMPHASIS>  decision or for any other reason must fully reflect that reality;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) it is in the national interest that the Act balance and reconcile to the maximum possible extent the interests and reasonable expectations of both Indigenous Australians and other major stakeholders&mdash;farmers, miners and Australian taxpayers generally;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) it is both in the national interest, and in the interests of Indigenous Australians, farmers and miners, that there be the maximum possible predictability and certainty about the status of the Act and its practical operation;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) there is a need, in particular, to guarantee the constitutional validity of the legislation, by ensuring that legislation operates for the net benefit of Indigenous Australians;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) it is also in everyone's interest that the processes established by this legislation to deal with the registration and determination of claims, and the reconciliation of competing interests, be as effective and expeditious as possible;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) there are aspects of the Bill which may advance these objectives, in particular by encouraging and assisting the entering into of agreements, and by setting a stricter regime for the registration of claims;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I honestly could not understand why most people who have some interest in this issue would not support that. Paragraph (7) goes into greater detail about our perceived concerns of the deficiencies of the bill and it requires substantial amendment. I do not want to focus on that because members on this side have already done so. I want to reassert those first six points.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us forego the stupid idea that all wisdom lies in the party in government or, for that matter, in opposition. Let us work together through this amendment bill, as we debate it during the consideration in detail stage, and come up with a bill that does truly respect the rights of all parties and so end once and forever the divisive nature of this issue.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Native Title Amendment Bill clearly demonstrates the differences between 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9425"> those opposite who are in government and Labor in government. Native title is one of the most important issues to face the Australian nation this century. It is an issue fundamentally linked to our sense of national identity. It is about whether we are a nation that has the political sophistication and tolerance to become a truly great multicultural society or whether we are a nation that will be permanently entwined in internal bickering and racial vilification.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Any legislation surrounding native title, therefore, has to be handled with long&hyphen;term vision. There has to be genuine statesmanship. There has to be a commitment to fairness and a healthy respect for the rights of all Australians. In particular, any legislation surrounding native title needs to be done by a government which acknowledges and honours the history and the common law rights that indigenous Australians possess.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is none of these things. Since coming to power last year, it has characterised itself as a mean&hyphen;spirited, self&hyphen;interested and incompetent government of the worst kind. Howard, his ministers and backbenchers mostly stood silent as the race debate enveloped the nation. They stood silent as young Vietnamese children got picked on in the playground in my electorate because they were different. They stood silent as black deaths in custody continued to rise. They stood silent as living conditions in some indigenous communities continued to be classed as Third World.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When they did respond, it was to give a boost to the cause of racial intolerance. Who can forget the so&hyphen;called `leadership' exhibited by John Howard when he addressed the Queensland division of the Liberal Party state council on 27 September 1996?

<PARA STYLE="Para">That was the response of our esteemed Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to one of the most virulently racist, hate&hyphen;filled and factually incorrect speeches ever given in this parliament.

He did not care that many Australians were crying out for their Prime Minister to stand up to this avowed racist, the member for Oxley. He merely wanted to please the Queensland branch of the Liberal Party and the sectarian interests of many of their supporters and to appeal to the pollsters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what, predictably, did the government do when the Wik decision came down from the High Court? In a now common pattern of behaviour, it showed no leadership and it showed no respect for the rule of law in our country. Instead it played divisive politics aimed at getting a few of its wealthier grazier mates a better land deal. Nothing in the Wik decision actually changes the legal interests of those with pastoral leases. The value of the pastoral estate and the value of the security which the pastoral lease may provide remain unaltered. There are no compensation obligations on pastoralists flowing from the Wik decision and, indeed, the High Court ruled that, where native title rights and pastoral leases coexisted, native title rights were subordinate to the pastoral leases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So why are we having this debate? The common law has not yet fully determined whether native title rights are permanently extinguished by the coexistence of a pastoral lease or whether they are merely temporarily suppressed. This has not, as yet, been decided by the High Court. Yet the government has decided to be above the law. They have decided to ignore the ruling of the highest court in our country. The government has decided to anticipate the outcomes of current court cases and conclude that pastoral leases do extinguish native title rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Pastoral leases have never given exclusive possession to the pastoralist. Under a pastoral lease you are not given the right to use the land exclusively; you are only given rights to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9426"> use the land for specific pastoral purposes. The government plans to allow state governments to upgrade these pastoral leases to freehold or perpetual leases. So in one fell swoop they are planning to extinguish the legal property rights of indigenous Australians and enhance the property rights of wealthy Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it gets worse. The National Indigenous Working Group on Native Title points out in its position paper entitled `The indigenous position&mdash;coexistence, negotiation and certainty', that the government has acknowledged that the upgrading of pastoral leases to perpetual or exclusive leases would involve the acquisition of property and just terms compensation for native title holders. In other words, the Australian taxpayer will be paying for the upgrading of pastoral leases for wealthy landowners. That is not governing for all of us; that is governing for only a few of us: for those most wealthy at the expense of those who can least afford to miss out in our society today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem is that the conservatives do not believe that indigenous Australians should have the same legally protected property rights as everyone else. They love to espouse the rhetoric of self&hyphen;help and economic independence for indigenous people. However, this does not mean that their rhetoric is backed up by action. The High Court has recognised that Aboriginal people have native title rights, fundamental legal property rights protected by law on an equal footing with the property rights of other Australians. This is as it should be. Property rights more than ever give indigenous people real economic independence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1995 the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commissioner, Mick Dodson, spoke about the Liberal Party's attitude to the Hindmarsh Island affair. At that time he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I find it increasingly difficult not to be cynical about the fine rhetoric of cultural diversity. We can freely sing our songs and tell our stories&mdash;especially if those songs and stories can be marketed for a tidy profit. But the moment that the protection of those songs and stories may come into conflict with the economic interests of non&hyphen;indigenous society, we are told they have no place. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I am proud to associate myself with Mick Dodson in this House tonight, because the same is true about indigenous property rights. The goal of economic independence for indigenous Australians is acceptable only if economic independence does not entail indigenous Australians becoming economic equals with white Australians. They are allowed to be independent economically if it means being independentally poor. They are not allowed to live in economic equality with the rest of the Australian nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But there is a way to resolve these problems. On 9 October 1996 the New South Wales Labor government settled a native title claim at Crescent Head on the New South Wales north coast. The President of the National Native Title Tribunal, Justice Robert French, announced that the native title compact between the state government and the native title holders&mdash;the Dunghutti people&mdash;showed:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mediation could work to produce agreements that address the aspirations of native title applicants and the broader concerns of local communities and governments.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Justice French also went on to explain that a number of processes contained in the Native Title Act were used in order to reach this historic agreement. The right to negotiate mechanism was used extensively. That is a key to this debate tonight. It is the same mechanism that this rotten government is trying to dramatically limit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All who were involved in the Crescent Head negotiations reported the outcome to be a success. The local National Party MP, Bruce Jeffrey, issued a press release stating that he was pleased that the issue was `sorted out to the benefit of the entire Crescent Head Community'. Mr Kim Yeadon, the New South Wales Minister for Land and Water Conservation, said the settlement gave `security to non&hyphen;Aboriginal landholders whilst also compensating traditional native title holders'. The whole process, he said, was settled in a `balanced and reasonable way'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the difference between those on this side of the House and the meanspirited mob on the other side. That is the difference between the current Prime Minister (Mr 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9427"> Howard) and the former Prime Minister, Paul Keating. When the former Prime Minister, Paul Keating, saw injustice, he was a statesman, whereas when Howard sees injustice, he is a coward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude with a now famous quote from a speech made by Paul Keating to launch the International Year for the World's Indigenous People. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The starting point might be to recognise that the problem starts with us non&hyphen;Aboriginal Australians. It begins, I think, with that act of recognition. Recognition that it was we who did the dispossessing. We took the traditional lands and smashed the traditional way of life. We brought the diseases, the alcohol. We committed the murders. We took the children from their mothers. We practised discrimination and exclusion. It was our ignorance and prejudice.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">With that sort of leadership, with that vision, with that sense of governing for the nation as a whole rather than a few sectarian interests, with all of that, the questions of Aboriginal native title and its relationship to other property rights can be resolved&mdash;with patience, with consultation and with political maturity. It is our duty as a parliament to ensure that we achieve this.</PARA></SPEECH>

They merely wanted to be able to visit sites of significance and to have traditional access for fishing and hunting.</PARA>

It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Department of Health and Family Services has reviewed three scientific articles describing research undertaken between 1959 and the mid&hyphen;1970's, in which hormones were administered to children in an effort to increase the height of short children and retard the growth of tall girls.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The review was requested by the Federal Minister for Health and Family Services, Dr Michael Wooldridge, and conducted by the Department in consultation with the relevant medical experts.  
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dr Wooldridge said the department had examined the scientific and ethical aspects of the research.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">`In relation to the short children treated with norethandrolone, the review found that serious long&hyphen;term side effects were unlikely,' Dr Wooldridge said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">`In relation to the hormone diethylstilboestrol used to retard the growth of tall girls, I am aware of the ethical issues and health concerns raised by women who had been involved in the research. I have been advised that there is no scientific evidence raising concerns about possible lasting side effects.'</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In an article in the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> , dated 10 October 1997, a spokeswoman for the tall girls who were used in this trial, Ms Janet Cregan&hyphen;Wood, said no such study had ever been carried out. She described Dr Wooldridge's response to the concerns of the women treated with DES as `totally inadequate'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> revealed in June that more than one in 60 Victorian teenage girls were used for the trial between 1959 and the mid&hyphen;1970s by researchers from the Royal Children's Hospital and Melbourne University. The article stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ms Cregan&hyphen;Wood said that more than half the women in a group formed to represent those used in the trial had suffered from ovarian cysts&mdash;one of the known side effects of DES&mdash;and other medical problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other possible known side effects include infertility, cancer of the cervix and breast cancer.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ms Cregan&hyphen;Wood said most of the girls who took part in the trial were not told it was an experiment or required to give informed consent.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">According to the minister, the department looked at three scientific articles in consultation with relevant medical experts. Those articles were written by Dr Norman Wettenhall, a Melbourne physician. The first was entitled `Influence of norethandrolone on the stature of short children' in 1963, the second was entitled `Tall girls assessment and management' in 1965 and the third was entitled `Tall girls&mdash;A survey of 15 years of management and treatment' from volume 86 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Journal of Adolescent Medicine</EMPHASIS> .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As someone who shared the biomedical library at Monash University in 1976 with Dr 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9429"> Wooldridge, studying biochemistry, I would like to put this question to the minister: why would he ask the Department of Health and Family Services to review only three articles? Why was a more thorough review of the many other articles available not undertaken, especially those articles assessing the effects on tall girls and, subsequently, their daughters of the synthetic oestrogen that they were given&mdash;a drug called stilboestrol?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why, for example, was the editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">British Medical Journal</EMPHASIS> dated 20 April 1963 not reviewed? This article, entitled `Drugs for altering the growth of children', warned of the dangers of using norethandrolone, reporting cases of jaundice and two deaths. It also suggested that, under the influence of this drug, skeletal maturation occurred at such a rapid rate that the potential ultimate height was actually less than would have been the case had natural processes prevailed. I suspect that the department did not review this article and others like it because they did not provide the department's desired result, that being that there is nothing to worry about. It sounds like a bit of a whitewash to me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dr Wettenhall's paper `Influence of norethandrolone on the stature of short children' did, however, draw the same conclusion that norethandrolone reduced the mature height of the children for the same reasons. Yet no work was done to find out what happened to the Victorian children either physically or psychologically as a result of the steroid treatment, the known side effects of steroids being obesity, infertility and depression.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister said that the department had also examined the ethical aspects of the research and found efforts were made by researchers at the time to counsel the girls and their families on the likely effects of this treatment. A short female colleague of mine to whom I have spoken says that this is rubbish. They were not told that they were the subject of experiments, and they were certainly not told of the side effects. She and her family did not know that she had been given norethandrolone until 1992, some 30 years later. The psychological damage has been considerable, with many suffering severe 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> depression and some becoming suicidal. These women were told that they were socially unacceptable. The treatment failed, and then they were dumped.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Melbourne medical establishment, of which Dr Wooldridge is a part, has closed ranks. It is very difficult for victims to go and access their medical records. The director of research at the children's hospital, Graeme Barnes, wrote to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> making the same claims as Dr Wooldridge that children were followed up and counselled. Repetition will not make this true; it simply is not. Dr Wooldridge's release also does not mention that norethandrolone is an anabolic steroid&mdash;a very nasty word. If it was okay to give steroids to children in the 1960s, why is there such a fuss about giving them to athletes now? <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="9429"><TITLE>Health Insurance</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to bring to the House my electorate's concerns over the increases in private health insurance premiums. I am well aware the government inherited a depleted private health insurance system caused by the previous Labor government, where membership dropped from 61 per cent of Australians to a disgraceful 35 per cent. However, it is incumbent on this government to address past wrongs and provide the necessary incentives to raise the level of private health insurance membership. We have started to do this by introducing a tax rebate of $150 for single people, $250 for couples and $450 for families. Those people who do not pay tax can claim the rebate through their health fund. But since these incentives were introduced, health insurance premiums have risen twice, forcing people in my electorate to either cancel or seriously reconsider their membership.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My office has received a considerable number of letters and telephone complaints about these increased premiums. On top of this, Central Queensland's daily newspaper, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Morning Bulletin</EMPHASIS>, conducted a survey on the issue which was published just recently. In this survey of a cross-section of the community, most people indicated that they will pull out or reconsider their health cover 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9430"> following these substantial increases and newly introduced excess and bed charges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have letters from elderly constituents who have been in health funds for 40 and 50 years and who are now being asked to pay approximately $45 per week for private health insurance with less cover than they have received in the past. This exorbitant fee is beyond the capacity of most pensioners. They are convinced that the health funds must consider them to be nothing more than a burden and therefore want them to be priced out of the system. This is wrong, it is sad and it needs to be addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Additionally, these pensioners can now be faced with paying the gap&mdash;the gap between medical costs and the health fund rebate. This gap amount can be astronomical to a pensioner, someone on a low income or someone with no income at all, and it requires considerable investigation before one makes a commitment to enter a hospital.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The crisis has been caused because health fund payments in hospitals fall far short of matching increased costs. Health care is labour intensive, skill intensive, facility intensive and technologically rich. In fact, from entry to the operating table and on to recovery, it takes a team of up to 28 personnel to service a patient.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Health is big business. It is a big employer of highly trained professionals and less highly trained support staff. The industry makes up approximately 10 per cent of the gross national product of our communities. Yet governments are reluctant to put more money into the system. Governments are not prepared to pay to employ more staff to service this industry to meet the community's needs and to reduce the long queues in the public health system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have is a public health system which is bleeding badly from its chronic financially anaemic coffers and a majority of private health funds lurching from crisis to crisis&mdash;and ready to fall over. As a government, we must be prepared to provide a big financial boost to hospitals on the proviso that they use the majority of this money to employ more staff. This will reduce the unemployment queues as well as the waiting lists.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The health funds need to reward loyalty by implementing an incentive scheme of no claim bonuses, similar to that implemented with car insurance. In that way, the long&hyphen;term member is not penalised in the short term&mdash;a get in and get out member. It also means that the elderly in our communities will not be paying higher fees as they age but will realise some reward for their long&hyphen;term commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a prime opportunity to create employment all around the country, shorten public hospital queues and give people a long&hyphen;term incentive to join a private health fund. At the next election we cannot blame the former government for the mess they have left us, even though they are responsible. This coalition government is now responsible for the future of our health system&mdash;a system that needs a massive overhaul and injection of funds to turn this depressing problem around.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="9430"><TITLE>Huon District Hospital</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to address the House on an issue that has been of great concern to me for some time now. Over the past few months I have become aware of increased speculation regarding the fate of the Huon District Hospital, which is situated in the township of Franklin in my electorate of Franklin.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Speaker, to give you a brief insight into the hospital and its facilities, the Huon hospital is what I would term the last bastion of rural hospitals. It is a small 10&hyphen;bed hospital, three of which are being used for acute care patients. It had several obstetric beds but, unfortunately, due to the uncertainty of their usage, midwifery competency skills were allowed to decline and these beds have now been closed. As a result of this, many expectant mothers in the southern part of my electorate now are forced to be admitted to hospital some 60 kilometres away. Those members who know of my electorate and its wintry conditions with snow would agree that it is rather depressing that this is the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also on the same site the elder care home, which is attached to the Huon hospital. This home caters for the elderly in this part of my electorate. However, of late, many of the much needed beds in the Huon hospital 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9431"> are now being taken by elderly patients who are awaiting admission into elder care. It is my view and that of many of my constituents that the state Liberal government is planning to close this hospital or, even worse, turn it into an extension of the elder care home, without any consultation. This will deny the people in the Huon region fair and equal access to health facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said, there is great concern by the residents in the area; there is so much, in fact, that a committee for the retention of the hospital has been set up by a group of residents in Franklin and Huonville. They have already tabled in the state parliament a petition on which there are some 3,000 signatures. I personally have voiced my concerns to the state Minister for Health, the Hon. Peter McKay; and I expect a full and satisfactory answer to the many questions that I have raised on behalf of these 3,000 constituents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as I am concerned, no real consultation has been entered into with the public, and definitely no consideration has been given to an already disadvantaged area of my electorate. The closure of this hospital is totally unacceptable and, as I said before, will take away a much needed and previously utilised facility in the southern part of the Franklin electorate. As the federal member for Franklin, I feel duty bound by my constituents to try and ensure that this closure does not occur and that the stress and anxiety placed on my constituents in the Huon region is removed once and for all.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="9431"><TITLE>Nursing Homes</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I wish to draw to the attention of the House the despicable behaviour of the opposition and, as circumstances would have it, its joint effort with the assistance of the media to beat up this issue and harass the elderly in our community over the aged care reform changes. What we saw today in the House at question time was nothing more than pure political grandstanding tactics designed to inflame and distort the reform process and achieve nothing but pure political advantage, at the expense of the feelings and emotional security of elderly Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has been duty bound to carry out reform and so provide better standards of care for elderly Australians in nursing care facilities. During the impassioned tirade of the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) or the `Minister for Scare', she had the unmitigated gall to accuse the government of being responsible for scaring the elderly. It became a huge verbal war. The debate lapsed into ineffectual and highly emotionally charged inaccuracies, as misinformation flew wildly from the opposition benches.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some may say it is the right and appropriate strategy of the opposition to denigrate and disparage every policy put forward by the government. This opposition obviously follows this belief. If, as any government or politician worth her salt would attest, they are here to represent the hopes and wishes of their electorate, then the best interests of the community should be the highest priority for those politicians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is in the interests of the present and future older Australians that the aged care reform package is seen to be necessary to be implemented after years of neglect and reluctance on behalf of the previous government to introduce significant changes that would go a long way to meeting the critical needs of a health sector that requires all the compassion and intense care that our community can muster.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In their loud and constant whine, the opposition have not told of the current flaws in the current nursing care sector. They have not mentioned the inconvenience of hostel patients being moved out of their local environment to a facility that relatives have to travel to every day at great expense to bring extra comfort to their loved ones. The aged care reform package will allow patients to receive care in place. The facilities will provide those essential services in the same location. The transference from hostel to nursing care will keep those patients in their own familiar location.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition did not mention that families will receive their inheritance as that portion of the accommodation bond returned at the end of five years or when the resident moves on. We all know what that means. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9432"> Surely a family member's level of care in the sunset years of life are more important than the massive amounts of dollars and cents being quoted here today as if it were all for nothing. The costs for nursing care are the greatest of all levels of medical need. I firmly believe that it is not too much to expect everyone to contribute to their care needs, no matter what their station.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we all head off into the sunset years, it is the duty of the government of the day to put into place such infrastructure and systems that will cater for the growing challenges of society at large. The growing need to have appropriate levels of care and standards of accommodation has been given to us, and the aged care reform package is a process of achieving satisfactory care facilities where our elderly residents receive the care and compassion they deserve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition did not mention that there are other levels of care where people stay in the family home with the love and care of palliative care helpers and nurses of their choice to see out those final days, weeks or months. The opposition did not mention that, in some states, state institutions do not have accommodation bonds for nursing care. What they have focused on is an idea that blatantly sets out to create fear and uncertainty in the minds of very vulnerable Australians. I have to ask you: what good have you done for the elderly in this whole emotive issue? Do you think you have made friends and influenced people with your scenarios of fear and gloom?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is surely the most devastatingly negative campaign I have seen, particularly when we as politicians are charged with the role of showing how we care for one another. If this is the opposition's idea of how to treat your friends or elderly folk, then who needs enemies? The benefits of the reform package will go a long way to improving the facilities in nursing institutions. The reforms have been endorsed by aged care providers in my electorate, and that does not mean it is finished with yet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have always believed that, if you cannot say anything nice about something, then do not say anything at all. The aged care reform package is a positive initiative that will help 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and provide comfort for many elderly Australians. So I look forward to the shadow minister for scare remaining absolutely silent on this issue for the rest of the debate.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="9432"><TITLE>Autism</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure most members of the House have seen the film <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rainman</EMPHASIS> , in which Dustin Hoffman gave an Oscar winning performance as a man with autism. Unfortunately, there are no such awards for the families of Australian people who experience autism. Recent information suggests that about one child in 1,000 in our population shows autistic tendencies, including problems with communication, behavioural difficulties and repetitive behaviour. The prognosis for most of these children is extremely poor.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a lifelong condition usually requiring lifelong commitment from family members in trying to make life as pleasant as possible for their relative. This care is made difficult by the inadequacy of knowledge about autism. Autism was only identified in 1943 and was first thought to be caused by obsessive, uncaring parents, a theory which has now been discredited. However, researchers are still not sure what causes the condition. Similarly, treatments vary from wearing specially coloured lenses, medication such as prozac and lithium, and play therapy, amongst a wide range of other choices. Many of these treatments are highly expensive, often controversial and have varying degrees of success.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Autism manifests itself in an equally wide range of ways. Many of the children diagnosed with autism are never able to communicate verbally. About one-third will develop problems with seizures, mostly during their teenage years. If you include children with Aspergers Disorder&mdash;and the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) might confirm my pronunciation&mdash;about five out of 10 will have an intellectual disability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only certainty in this area is the importance of having a loving, caring family around the autistic person. Parents and other relatives are desperately searching for the answers to their many questions and are doing their utmost to provide the highest quality of life 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9433"> for their loved ones. Their search is being made more difficult in Australia by the fact that all the services for autistic people take place on an uncoordinated state basis rather than a federal basis. This means that information sharing, available resources and general information to families caring for an autistic person are fragmented and laborious to track down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is why the recent National Conference of the National Association for Autism, made up of state based autism groups, has endorsed the need to establish a permanent recognised peak body for the autistic and their families. The association has applied to the Department of Health and Family Services for seed funding to enable them to set up the necessary structures to put this in place. I wish them success in being granted this funding and in achieving a higher profile for autism in government departments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are several examples of the lack of recognition for this disorder that deeply concern the association. For example, the new questionnaire being used to determine the level of family need for child disability allowances does not make allowance for the highly individualistic nature of the autistic child. There is a need for autism to be recognised as a discrete disability condition and a recognition that some high functioning individuals still have high support needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to these requirements, government departments need to realise that autism is often misdiagnosed and people can be incorrectly labelled as suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder or schizophrenia. Generally, autism disorders have been grouped with intellectual disability or psychological problems and not treated as an individual group. This attitude takes us back to the time before 1943, when the autistic were diagnosed as mentally ill or retarded and their true condition was not discovered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government needs to recognise this important group of Australians and their families. These people should not be labelled as intellectually disabled or mentally ill. Certainly, more support must be given to their carers. I emphasise that point.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current policies of state and federal governments favour a broadbanding approach to disability resource funding as opposed to the specialist approach that is essential to people with autism and their families. In particular, there needs to be more funding for adults affected by autism to increase their integration into the community. These Australians deserve an informed, appropriate response to their needs. I add my support to the National Association for Autism in its attempt to get a better deal for these Australians. I urge the government in the strongest terms to provide immediate assistance.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="9433"><TITLE>Defence Force: Morale</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For some time I have been concerned about the morale of the defence forces, so much so that I joined the Liberal Party to work towards a position where I could have some influence upon decisions in the ADF that have led to such dispirited troops. The case of LAC Woods is a good example of the poor leadership and inconsistent decision making that is so bad for morale. CAS has recommended his discharge for dishonesty in relation to a $200 travel claim for which he has been tried and punished under the Defence Force Discipline Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">LAC Woods had an outstanding record for five years in support units before coming to No. 33 Squadron operations. There are dozens of character references from other RAAF personnel to this effect, and these people will be watching with interest the outcome of the Woods case. He joined the RAAF motivated to succeed and, once he got through basic training, has been working hard to improve himself and obtain career goals. No doubt he has adopted many of the RAAF cultures in the various work environments of the ADF.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> These cultures develop from what I term `morality creep'. This is where, over a period of time, a unit allows little diversions from the strict rules or allows interpretations of those rules which then become culture. Gradually everyone knows the limits in the interpretation of the rules and an accepted standard of behaviour develops. The only ones who are disciplined for low standards of behaviour are those who fall out of favour 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9434"> with the chain of command. This was LAC Woods's only crime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I have seen this happen with paying compliments, claiming allowances, obeying orders, performing guard duty and enforcing standards of dress and behaviour in the messes. These cultures do exist and will continue while high profile officers are not discharged for defrauding the Commonwealth of substantially more than the $200 LAC Woods has claimed and repaid. Such inconsistencies have created the attitude in the ADF that `everyone is doing it with no disadvantage, so I am a mug if I do not'. This morality creep quickly overtakes the new recruit and saps ethics, enthusiasm and initiative. Promotion depends on a good personal relationship with your superior and how many favours you perform. Morality creep continues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> After seven years of disruptive policy changes and willy&hyphen;nilly personnel reductions, it is hard to convince remaining personnel that there are not double standards in the ADF. Ad hoc decisions to discharge LAC Woods but not Squadron Leader Whiting or Wing Commander Foley for the same thing are no way to develop the personnel required for a modern defence force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The consequences of low morale were evident in No. 33 Squadron at the time of the 707 accident, which killed five squadron members. Do not underestimate morale as a real resource in any battle. Everyone who wrote a reference for Woods, everyone who has worked with him and everyone who has an opinion on the different treatment between officers and troops will discuss the Woods case&mdash;to the detriment of No. 33 Squadron leadership and RAAF leadership overall.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that, due to the promotion methods in the RAAF, personnel with very little leadership skills have been placed in key positions from which they can destroy the morale of a unit and add substantially to the cost of running a defence force, the cost of training personnel to replace those who leave, the cost of mistakes due to inexperience&mdash;such as the 707 accident&mdash;the cost of cultures of allowance abuse and pilfering, and the cost of legal proceedings to resolve personnel issues which should have been resolved at the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> grassroots level&mdash;for example, the Butterworth board of inquiry into personal relations between a CO and his troops is estimated to have cost $6 million. Now we have a similar inquiry into a navy culture of customs fraud. I am interested to see which ranks will be sacrificed to public opinion in that inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> LAC Woods has informed me that his chain of command at No. 33 Squadron contained personnel with whom he had come into conflict at times when they were all in separate units. It takes a great deal of leadership to avoid the obvious conclusion that those superiors thought little of LAC Woods and, as soon as an opportunity to get even with LAC Woods became available, they made his life as difficult as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is easy in the military where the official rules demand one standard of behaviour but the accepted norm is another. In the ordinary course of events, no-one is given a formal warning for variation from the rules within the accepted unofficial standard. When the people in your chain of command wish to make it difficult for you, it is easy to rely on the official standards to award sanctions and ultimately demand your resignation. LAC Woods is a victim of these double standards, with no recourse to a union or separate organisation not guided by the views of his superiors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> LAC Woods's previous five years of service and numerous references speak for themselves. How can someone with such a record, who was selected above many others for one of the most sought&hyphen;after flight steward positions, lose touch so badly with the required standards within a four&hyphen;month period? There are many people at Richmond who have an interest in this case because, if it can happen to LAC Woods, it can happen to them if they fall out of favour with the chain of command. Try rebuilding morale in that atmosphere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we should be going back to basics in recruit training and change these work cultures with positive, consistent leadership. There should be an independent union for ADF personnel with more teeth than AFUR

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for the Environment has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Under the Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1989 there are strict penalties for offences under the Act, including fines of up $A1 million and imprisonment for executive officers of companies for up to 5 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I note that the maximum penalties under the Act were significantly strengthened by amendments to the Act passed under the Howard Government. The Howard Government's amendments also expanded the scope of the Act to ensure our obligations under the Basel Convention are met. The previous Labor Government failed to adequately address these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories has taken steps to appoint expert inspectors under the Act to conduct searches on an ad hoc basis and has undertaken an educational program to ensure that Australian exporters and importers are aware of the requirements relating to international movements of hazardous wastes. A Memorandum of Understanding on compliance issues will be signed with the Australian Customs Service in the near future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The Hong Kong Government has asked that the waste be returned to Australia as their investigations found the waste to be hazardous.
