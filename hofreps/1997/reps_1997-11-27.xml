<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This bill proposes to amend the National Health Act 1953, the Health Insurance Act 1973, the Social Security Act 1991 and the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. The amendments will give effect to a part of the government's package of reforms to private health insurance. The reforms contained in this bill will:</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> engender a positive and competitive environment in the private health sector;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> reduce some of the cost pressures on health insurance premiums;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> make contracting more attractive between the various parties; and</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> help consumers by reducing the problems of often large and unexpected out&hyphen;of&hyphen;pocket expenses and multiple medical bills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Private health insurance has been the subject of inquiries by the Industry Commission and by the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee. The package of reforms contained in this bill responds to those recommendations requiring legislation that could be dealt with immediately and incorporates the reforms announced by the government on 19 August 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The commission also made a number of recommendations that require further analysis and development. The most important of these is unfunded lifetime community rating, which the government is now examining to deter 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> mine its feasibility. Unfunded lifetime community rating is designed to balance the age distribution of fund membership, make private health insurance more affordable for young and old alike, and reward loyalty for people who are members for long periods of time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are also reforms that do not require legislation. The government has decided to establish a second&hyphen;tier default benefit which would apply where there is no contract between a private hospital and a fund but where the hospital has in place arrangements for informed financial consent and simplified billing and evidence of an appropriate level of treatment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australians overwhelmingly support Medicare and the universal access to public health services that this entails. Yet, at the same time, over one&hyphen;third of the population still has some form of private health insurance. Clearly, we have a universally available public health system which is highly valued by most Australians. At the same time, many people also want to have choice of access to the private health sector. The government supports this choice. The key for most Australians to this access is private health insurance, with approximately 80 per cent of private hospital episodes funded this way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous government's policy position was to say that private health insurance in the private sector was simply supplementary to Medicare. It grudgingly acknowledged that the private sector existed but that this was a minor role compared with the taxpayer funded system. In sharp contrast to this monocular view, this government is focused on the total health system&mdash;public and private. The private hospital system is an essential ingredient in the nation's health care mix. The community needs to have access to the existing range of beds and services across both the public and the private sectors. It is a matter of common sense to maximise the use of our existing acute capital stock&mdash;both public and private&mdash;rather than simply commit billions of extra dollars to funding new public hospital beds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's message is loud and clear: the private sector is a vital complement to the long&hyphen;term viability of Medicare and the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11436"> public hospital system. Importantly, this is not just idle rhetoric. Active and positive steps are being taken to ensure that private health insurance is a realistic choice for those Australians who wish to maintain it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill introduces reforms to private health insurance that build on the government's private health insurance incentives scheme and the adjustments to the Medicare levy for people on higher incomes who have chosen not to insure themselves privately. I will now outline the main elements of the reform package.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first set of the reforms will make contracting between funds, hospitals and doctors more attractive. The private health insurance legislation introduced by the previous government relied on contracting between funds and doctors to address a number of issues affecting private health insurance, including the incidence of unknown out&hyphen;of&hyphen;pocket costs. This legislation has been a spectacular failure, with only a handful of doctors prepared to enter contracts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Department of Health and Family Services estimated when it first came into place on 1 October 1995 that, within two years, 20 per cent of doctors would have such arrangements. Today there would be less than a handful of doctors around Australia who have been prepared to do so. The result is that consumers have continued to experience often large and unanticipated out&hyphen;of&hyphen;pocket medical bills. It is vital that we achieve greater certainty for consumers either through informed financial consent, so that they know in advance the out&hyphen;of&hyphen;pocket costs, or, even better, through securing agreements for 100 per cent cover for their medical bills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Schedule 3&mdash;paragraphs 5, 6 and 7&mdash;will for the first time allow health funds to pay medical benefits above the Medicare benefits schedule (MBS) to doctors who have practitioner agreements with private hospitals. And, as is currently the case, practitioner agreements will only be permitted where the hospital also has a fixed cost contract, known as a hospital purchaser&hyphen;provider agreement, with the fund. The effect of these new arrangements will be either to exclude out&hyphen;of&hyphen;pocket costs altogether or to allow for a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> predetermined amount of such costs known by the person in advance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The level of payment for in&hyphen;hospital medical services will be negotiated between the hospital and the doctor concerned. Such payment may be on whatever basis the hospitals and doctors choose. Examples include a percentage of the MBS fee, a retainer or some other agreed block payment. Where doctors have practitioner agreements, the bill enables the 75 per cent Medicare benefit to be paid direct to the health fund. In these circumstances, the assignment of the Medicare benefit by the patient to the fund will be mandatory. This will greatly simplify the billing and claiming process for patients.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, doctors will no longer have to negotiate only with the funds, which is a key objection that the medical profession has raised and steadfastly maintained since 1994. Agreements will be negotiated by the people directly involved in providing care to patients, who will then be able to provide services for no or known out&hyphen;of&hyphen;pocket costs and with greatly simplified billing and claiming procedures for the patient.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, paragraph four of schedule 3 will require all agreements offered by funds or hospitals to include a clause guaranteeing the general professional freedom of doctors to identify the appropriate treatment for their patients within the scope of accepted clinical practice. With the exception of the price arrangements entered into by the parties, which will remain commercial&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence, and information relating to individuals, which will be confidential, the agreements will be open to public scrutiny. Both patients and doctors are correctly worried about US&hyphen;style managed care. I have worked in the United States and seen the situation where funds have used their market power to dictate or limit clinical decisions. I am not prepared to allow this to happen in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation protects the clinical independence of doctors within the boundaries of accepted clinical practice. It is the first time that this principle has been enshrined in law in Australia. With the threat of US&hyphen;style managed care removed from the equation, I am confident that doctors will be more willing 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11437"> to negotiate arrangements with private hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Of course, it remains entirely their call. Many will choose not to, and they have the right to do that. Nothing in this legislation changes that. I hope the profession understands that their cooperation is absolutely essential if the private health care sector is to remain viable, which depends largely on private health insurance continuing to cover a large proportion of the population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second set of amendments removes unnecessary costs on funds, improves the regulatory environment and makes refinements to existing legislation to improve the operation of the industry. Schedule 1 will tighten the definition of `health insurance business' to reduce the potential for new products entering the market to undermine the government's commitment to community rating. Products have been, and many more could be, designed which are risk rated. But they effectively provide health insurance by extending the number and range of conditions, drawing on the model of trauma insurance and basing payments on estimated hospital and medical costs. The changes to the legislation will make it clearer that products of this nature cannot be marketed other than as community rated health insurance, while leaving legitimate trauma and life products in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Schedule 2 replaces the current provision which requires the payment of benefits at an acute rate for the first 35 days of hospitalisation, irrespective of whether acute care is provided. The new regulation will provide for a determination of benefits for nursing home type patients on the occasion where acute care is provided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Schedule 4 will allow changes to reinsurance arrangements to be made by a disallowable instrument and facilitate necessary changes to reinsurance that may become necessary in the future. Schedule 5 restructures the Private Health Insurance Administration Council with a new board independent of the Department of Health and Family Services and the industry. It will include a commissioner and two to four other individuals. The changes were recommended by the Industry Commission. Schedule 6 contains a number 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of measures that will assist the Private Health Insurance Complaints Commissioner to provide an effective and efficient operation over the next few years, by which time information will be available to assess whether more substantial powers are required. The commissioner will also be renamed the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Paragraphs two and three of schedule 7 extend the maximum waiting period for obstetrics from nine to 12 months. Extending the waiting period to 12 months will help to reduce some of the cost pressures faced by the health insurance industry from so&hyphen;called `hit and run' patients, who join knowing that they will have to use the product and then leave immediately, making everyone else pay more. Schedule 8 will allow the assignment of Medicare payments for in&hyphen;hospital medical treatment by the patient to another party as part of an approved simplified billing arrangement. This will encourage the development of simplified billing arrangements for patients treated by doctors not covered by agreements with either health funds or hospitals. Paragraphs one, two and three of schedule 11 will make it clear that for&hyphen;profit organisations are on the same footing as not&hyphen;for&hyphen;profit organisations in terms of applying for registration as a health fund. It will facilitate the transition of existing non&hyphen;profit funds to for&hyphen;profit status, if that is their desire.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reforms in this bill have the potential to create an environment which is more attractive to not only new players but also the Australian community through the development of health insurance products that truly offer value for money. They also form part of a comprehensive package of related measures to make the most of our existing health care assets, both public and private, and to ensure that Australians can look forward confidently to assured quality health care.

The amendment will result in product safety standards being subject to a harmonisation program along with other products covered by the special exemption mechanism, such as motor vehicles, therapeutic goods and gas appliances.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Dumping is a threat to our manufacturing industry at any stage. That is why a country like ours, which seeks to build its manufacturing base, needs to ensure that it has in place effective anti&hyphen;dumping legislation and speedy procedures by which that legislation can be acted upon. That is a position that is required in normal circumstances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We face a potentially bigger threat in terms of dumped product coming onto our markets at the moment because of the spreading and significant Asian economic downturn, the consequent oversupply in those markets, and the desire for them to ensure that that supply is sold. That is why we believe that not only the  Customs Tariff (Anti&hyphen;Dumping) Amendment Bill 1997  but also the government's bill to implement the recommendations of the Willett report require urgent introduction into and urgent action in the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Anti&hyphen;dumping measures are not about protecting Australian industry, they are about ensuring fairness so that our manufacturing industry does not have to compete against unfair or unrealistically fixed prices. That is the fairness aspect, so let no&hyphen;one pretend that strong anti&hyphen;dumping legislation is about protecting Australian industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said before, the current Asian economic circumstances establish the urgency of this. This is but one of two pieces of legislation that the government should be bringing on urgently for finalisation. The other legislation relates to a report which the government commissioned when it came to office to implement an election promise to cut the length of time it took to run an anti&hyphen;dumping case. The government made an election promise to reduce the number of days to 155. It commissioned a report to tell it how to do 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11439"> that. The government got the report that showed how to do it consistent with our international trading and WTO obligations. It then got too hard, and the government said it was going to refer it to the Productivity Commission for implementation. The government has not even framed the terms of reference to the Productivity Commission, and it has taken no action to ensure that Australian manufacturers can operate in circumstances in which they are not threatened by unfair prices coming in and undercutting the market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Anyone who has been to the north of Tasmania or into Gippsland recently knows the problem that the pulp and paper industry is facing from the threat of dumped product from Indonesia. Jobs are at stake and communities may be wrecked. The livelihoods of people are under threat because of this government's inaction. These are people who have shown commitment by lifting productivity, embracing new technology, changing work practices and making a commitment to developing world&hyphen;class operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To try to force the government on these issues, Labor has introduced two private members bills. We have taken the initiative again, as we did with the car and textiles industries and the ship and book bounties. Labor is setting the agenda for industry policy in this country. This industry policy would cost the government&mdash;if it could actually grapple with it&mdash;nothing. This legislation expedites dealing with cases and ensures fairness in the way in which we assess whether product is being dumped. This is the easiest form of industry policy available, and the government has again failed to act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had the matter of public important yesterday on the government's failure on industry policy. We listed anti&hyphen;dumping as one of the things on which the government has failed. The minister sitting back from the table, the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs (Mr Truss), has responsibility for this customs area, even though his senior minister has responsibility for the policy. Whenever the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) is asked a question in the parliament, he flick passes it. He writes letters to people telling them that he has policy 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> responsibility, but he will not be held accountable in the House. Let's face it, he is a hopeless minister. This is an example of having responsibility, but obtaining money under false pretences because he is not prepared to act upon it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Geoffrey Prosser. This was his last official act. This bill was introduced by the government in June. But when is it brought on for debate? The second last week of the year. What has the government done in scheduling priority in the Senate? It has not given it priority. Our campaign on this has embarrassed the government into bringing the debate on in the House, but it is not serious about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation will not be able to be dealt with by the Senate until at least March of next year. Between now and then, according to the government, China is going to be considered a free market for all products. This is your decision, made not on the basis of any policy imperative, not on arguing the case as to why we should treat China as a market economy, not on arguing the toss, but simply on having been forced to introduce this legislation because of a botch&hyphen;up by the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer)&mdash;as he now is&mdash;in his capacity as Minister for Trade when he was in China last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over there, embarrassed by the fiasco they created by scrapping the DIFF scheme and anxious to create an environment of cooperation in trade, when the Acting Prime Minister is asked, `Will you consider treating China as a market economy to improve trade between the countries?', he agrees to do so. Tim agrees, in private, without any discussion. In the process of doing that, they thought they could allow this approach on a case by case basis. They allowed it in the case of a product called glyphosate, a product that would be well known to consumers who need herbicides for either gardening or farming purposes. It is used in Roundup and Zero. It is a product that was produced in this 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11440"> country, but no more. A potential investment in this country, an $80 million investment, has now gone to Argentina because of this decision of the government on glyphosate&mdash;an $80 million investment lost, along with hundreds of jobs.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government created the problem that we have got, which this bill seeks to effect, more than a year ago when they decided to treat goods from China on a case by case basis. This, it would seem, resulted from a trade&hyphen;off for the botch&hyphen;up over the DIFF scheme. Despite the fact that we have asked the Deputy Prime Minister questions, we have had no explanation in this House as to what he said, and why he said it, to Madam Wu; no explanation at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I challenge the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs (Mr Truss), when he has got the opportunity to reply in this debate, to tell us what did take place in those discussions and why we are facing the circumstances of China now being treated as a market economy. This has not occurred through any policy imperative that they came and explained, so why did they do it? What was the basis of the discussion? What was the compelling case put by China to our Deputy Prime Minister that convinced him to do what no other country in the world does in the way they treat China for the purposes of anti&hyphen;dumping?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have seen here is a government that have mishandled the matter. It has resulted in their thinking they could do it on a case by case basis. With this one product, glyphosate, they thought they could treat it on a case by case basis, but now, having allowed one in, the position is that all goods from China have to be considered as coming from a free market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of glyphosate, this is where the position really gets bad for the government, because there was overwhelming evidence that the export and domestic pricing of glyphosate from China was government controlled. We asked the minister in the parliament whether he was aware of a notice 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11441"> of the coordination meeting on the pricing of glyphosate. Understand the imagery of this: China, according to the government, is a free market economy. Free market means market forces run. You do not sit down in cartels or monopoly arrangements and fix prices together. You would have to accept that the latter does not fit the definition, Minister, of a free market. He has turned off. I cannot even get a nod from him. Maybe he does not understand what a free market is. Do you accept that a market is not a free market if there is price fixing going on? Do you accept that?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the member for Corio points out, what hope have we got with you? What hope has Australian manufacturing industry got. What about your peanut farmers, Minister? You talk tough for them, but this is no indication that you are prepared to act for them. The simple fact of the matter is this: this government, despite evidence to the contrary, has determined that China is a free market and that has resulted in glyphosate being allowed to come into this country from China. That saw Monsanto make the decision to invest in an $80 million plant not in Australia but in Argentina. It is not as if the government did not know about this. Monsanto warned the government about the consequences of their action. I might just quote from a letter that they wrote to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on 22 November 1996, more than 12 months ago. They wrote to the Prime Minister because they thought that this was such an important issue. They had no confidence in your predecessor. They had no confidence in the industry minister. In that letter to the Prime Minister they said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a company, we have several manufacturing facilities in Australia which recently announced plans to invest a further $80 million into Australian manufacturing. The move&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is, the move by you to treat China as a market economy&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">created much doubt as to the soundness of any such investment.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They warned the government and the Prime Minister in that letter that, unless this issue was fixed, the investment would be lost to the country. I would be interested to know wheth 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="11442"> er the Prime Minister ever responded to the company. There seems to be no record around. This is a Prime Minister who not only cannot lead; he closes his eyes when presented with an issue. `Close the eyes and hope it goes away' is the Prime Minister's philosophy in life. `It will not be a headline tomorrow; don't have to deal with it. It's not a crisis today; don't have to deal with it.' It is a crisis now, 12 months down the track, because the $80 million investment in Australia has been lost, jobs have been lost and regional development has been lost&mdash;all because the government has failed to act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said before that Australia's position on this is unique. No other OECD nation treats product from China in the way your government does, Minister. Why is it that we have to take this stupid lead? I can understand leadership, but this is stupidity. This is a circumstance where there is no pressure on us to do it, there are no international pressures and no precedent. It is simply a request, presumably to the Deputy Prime Minister&mdash;who is feeling pretty guilty because we have axed some effective export programs&mdash;and he agrees. No consultation, but look at the consequences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are not the only consequences. The fact of the matter is that other significant investments have also been threatened or lost as a result of the government's U&hyphen;turn following what happened. Pilkingtons employment&mdash;they produce glass; it is a very important industry in the member for Corio's electorate&mdash;has declined from 1,022 to 746. They have lost 276 jobs. We have lost 100 jobs as a result of the Monsanto failure and we have lost the $80 million investment. Garmond picture framers have laid off 20 per cent of their work force, including highly skilled craftsmen, and ACI Fibreglass is contemplating its position on fibreglass manufacturing in Australia. Well done, Minister!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was the government committed to creating 200,000 new jobs in manufacturing and all they have done is to drive them backwards. As I say, this does not even cost them anything. This does not even involve the so&hyphen;called business welfare that they like to label the other business programs with. They 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> could not run a manufacturing policy for this country if they tried, and that is the disgrace of it all. That is why we are seeing employment fall in this country and that is why we need more urgent, more effective action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no deliberate policy imperative in what this legislation does. The bill is not putting in place new policy which is being consciously determined. It is about fixing the mess created by the incompetence of the Acting Prime Minister. Market status in anti&hyphen;dumping cases was offered to China to make up for the government's foreign policy failings in areas such as the axing of the DIFF scheme.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="TRUSS" NAMEID="GT4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Wrong!</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr CREAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let us hear your explanation and, most importantly, tell us why you have sat on this for the past six months as a government and why you have given it no urgency in the Senate. Tell us why this exposure to dump product from China is still going to persist for at least the next three months. Tell us why, Minister, you have only got a half&hyphen;baked response in the House and you are not even prepared to back it with legislative support in the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are stuck with is a hybrid case. The government have not only mishandled the DIFF issue in China, but because of the way they have mishandled the issue we cannot restore the previous arrangements. Once one product is allowed in it has to apply to all of them. We are stuck with the hybrid case by case arrangement. The question now is: how do we make it work? This legislation does not provide the answer to that question. It results in the de facto recognition of practically all Chinese product as being from a free market. The legislation fails to take account of the market situation for inputs within each industry sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Take shirts, for example. This is an easy example to understand. Under the government's legislation, provided the finished shirt is sold in China in a free market circumstance the determination of its price takes account of what happens in China. But what if the material, the buttons, the power and the machinery all come from state owned enterprises, all of which are capable of fixing 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11443"> the price? Under this legislation, that set of factors cannot be taken into account. One of our amendments&mdash;I am foreshadowing at this stage we will be moving amendments in the consideration in detail stage&mdash;redresses that position. It requires the circumstances of inputs to be taken into account in determining whether China is the case example or whether some surrogate pricing arrangement should apply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to hear that the government has recognised that its legislation as introduced is inadequate and that it will be moving some amendments. The amendments go some of the way towards meeting our concerns, but not far enough. The amendments that the government has proposed are unsatisfactory. They fail on two counts. In an effort to address the fundamental issue of input prices, which are government controlled, the amendments propose `flexibility' in addressing inputs. A better word, I suggest, would be `uncertainty'.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government input price can be ignored, it can be accepted or it can be substituted with the cost of that input from another country. That is at the minister's whim. So understand this: you have got flexibility at three different levels. For input prices, it is in at Customs consideration level, out at the Anti&hyphen;Dumping Authority; in again at minister level or the reverse. We do not want flexibility, we want certainty. We want to know whether input prices are properly considered. Our amendments seek to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Besides creating huge uncertainty, the amendments will add even greater complexity to an already complex piece of legislation as proponents argue which surrogate country should be used for each significant cost input. The amendments that the Labor opposition will move propose a similar trigger system if greater than 10 per cent of the input is government controlled. In other words, if inputs represent 10 per cent, then a surrogate country test is required. Total surrogacy would then become, as it was before, the way in which we would treat cases in relation to China, not the alternative so&hyphen;called free market arrangements. The amendment to subsection 269(5F) further compounds the uncertainty in the legislation. In circumstances 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> where foreign government price control is identified, discretion is allowed as to whether or not to establish a normal value inquiry in a free market country. The amendments that Labor is proposing do not allow for that discretion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second major count where the government's amendments fail is the recognition that in economies in transition industry sectors still exhibit substantial government control because of the presence of state owned enterprises trading at distressed prices. These industry sectors do not represent a free market and domestic prices should not be accepted as a basis for normal value. Again, the amendments that we are proposing cover this by ensuring that, where there is substantial government ownership in a sector, surrogacy should again apply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Take again the example of the shirt. Sure, you can have a whole lot of shirt manufacturers producing in what is considered to be a free market. But if there is a state owned shirt company as well that finds itself in difficulty and forces the prices down, what do you think the domestic prices have got to do? They too have got to drop to compete. Yet, in the circumstances of the government's bill, no account is taken of the significant influence that a state owned enterprise would have. Again, the government has recognised that problem in this bill, but it has only come up with a half&hyphen;baked solution which creates uncertainty because of its proposed unwarranted complexity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are saying that this bill is deficient. We are also laying the charge that the government is not serious about amending it. The government has been forced into it only because we came in and said, `Do something because there is a lot of concern out there.' They are not serious about doing it because they have not given it priority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So far I have mentioned cost. The other point that I would like to make is this: the bill that we introduced on Monday provides the real alternative. It is what the government should be embracing. In essence, the amendments that I am foreshadowing pick up the thrust of what my new bill proposes. But I think it is important to understand that all of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11444"> what Labor is proposing is consistent with our international trading obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I would like to read from a memo which I sought from the Department of the Parliamentary Library when we submitted our bill to them for consideration. The conclusion they came to was:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in support of the  <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R247">Customs Legislation (Anti&hyphen;Dumping) Amendment Bill 1997</XREF>  and <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R246">Customs Tariff (Anti&hyphen;Dumping) Amendment Bill 1997</XREF> , which aim to amend the Customs Act 1901. In particular these amendments will provide for a special approach to determining normal values of allegedly dumped goods from countries that are in a process of transition from a controlled to a market economy. They will also clarify the provisions which relate to the manner in which interim dumping and countervailing duties are collected, in particular to ensure that interim dumping and countervailing duties can be imposed prior to the final assessment of duties payable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dumping is the term used to describe the selling of goods in foreign markets at prices lower than those achieved in the home market which causes material injury to industries in the importing countries. Australia has a long history of attempting to protect its domestic markets from dumped imported product. In fact, we began legislating against unfair trading practices as early as 1921.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In recent times a code of practice has been developed by the World Trade Organisation which aims to achieve some conformity in the member nations' definitions and administration of anti-dumping laws. The WTO has recognised that there is the potential for some countries to try to disguise non-tariff barriers as anti-dumping actions, especially in this increasingly globalised world economy.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to Australia that we support the WTO in its efforts to enforce fair anti-dumping regimes amongst its signatories. And, of course, we need to ensure that our own legislation is fair and works in the nation's interests. It is always amazing to me to hear how a member of the opposition, previously in government for some 13 years, becomes very indignant that our government in its first 20 months has failed, they say, to act, when for 13 years we have had a substantial problem in terms of industry being able to deal effectively with product dumped into this country. Suddenly they become extraordinarily upset, but it took us only a few months in government to tackle the problem. It is amazing what opposition does to you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In June 1996 the then Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs commissioned a review of Australia's anti-dumping and countervailing duties administration. It was one of his earliest acts. The so&hyphen;called Willett report has since made some important recommendations which have been welcomed by industry. We have already moved to shorten the time it takes for anti-dumping actions to be processed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia has long been committed to the concept of free trade. Successive governments have supported this policy. We have been amongst the first in the region to lower tariffs and to abolish quotas. Successive Australian governments have determinedly put aside barriers to expose our industries to head-on competition from imports from countries where there is cheaper labour, bigger economies of scale, or longer experience of producing world best product. Successive Australian governments have had to do this to ensure our long&hyphen;term survival in the new era of globalisation and as a nation that is export dependent, in particular in the sector of primary production.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While our actions show we are serious when it comes to fair trade, we have also made ourselves a target for unfair competition from dumped product. Countries are lured by the reality of our zero or low tariffs and quota restrictions to attempt to put their product into our domestic markets at prices way below their normal value.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11445">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Effective anti-dumping systems are therefore of profound importance to this nation. Our government recognises that. Most of our Australian industry must be able to generate sufficient profit from domestic sales to invest back into their enterprises to make them world competitive. Indeed, for many, their very survival is dependent on a swift and adequate response to the importation of any dumped product.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These amendments are part of this government's response to the challenge to protect our Australian manufacturers and producers from unfair competition through dumping. Industry can then provide the employment and generate the wealth that this country needs to maintain our standards of living.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most important amendments before us in this debate deal with the problem that arises when an anti-dumping inquiry needs to determine normal values of goods from a country that is moving from a government controlled or planned economy to a market economy. Of course, China is the obvious example of just such an economy in transition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under current legislation, an investigating authority needs to determine normal values for goods exported from command economies by reference to information obtained in a surrogate country. However, Customs has received legal advice from both the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the international section of the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department confirming that this subsection is severely limited in its application. It requires that the government of the country of export has a substantial monopoly on all trade of the country&mdash;not just in terms of the goods under investigation&mdash;and must also substantially influence the domestic price of all goods in that country, if a surrogate is to be used.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our proposed amendments are necessary because, although the governments of economies in transition may still maintain controls over the domestic selling prices of a significant number of products, they may not have control to the extent currently required under subsection 269TAC(4) to allow the use of surrogates.  </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our amendments will allow normal values to be ascertained in cases of economies in transition on a case by case basis after reference to other relevant information, including the selling prices of goods in a surrogate country, in situations where Customs and the Anti-Dumping Authority are satisfied that the exporter's domestic selling prices for the product under investigation are subject to government control or substantial government control.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An issue of concern acknowledged in the time that we have been developing these amendments is that subsidisation may occur at various stages in the manufacturing and export of product from a planned or evolving economy. And this is what the previous speaker, the member for Hotham (Mr Crean), was getting so excited about. We understand this issue and we are dealing with it through these amendments. We know that subsidisation may occur at various stages of the manufacture and export of product from a planned economy or one in the process of transition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, the foreign government may control all or some of the prices of significant raw material inputs into the manufacturing process. During the deliberations of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee considering these amendments, industry strongly represented its concerns about the need to take into account any continued state subsidisation of raw materials in a transition economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, our proposed amendments being debated today will enable investigators to also consider raw material inputs into the production of allegedly dumped goods when that raw material input is supplied to the manufacturer by a state owned enterprise and where that raw material input is significant, meaning that its cost to the manufacturer exceeds 10 per cent of the total production costs. There is nothing flexible about that; there is nothing discretionary. It is absolutely clear and gives certainty. These amendments, and those that allow a case by case decision to be made in regard to whether or not a sector is still state controlled in an economy in transition, will mean fairer dealings for industries in the future.  </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11446">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said, Australia, with its low tariff and quota regimes, is particularly vulnerable to exporters of dumped goods, and processed food is a prime example. The food and agribusiness industries in the electorate of Murray that I represent generate around $1.8 billion worth of food products annually, and $1 billion of this value is generated in export markets. Some of Australia's primary industries have led the way in adapting to a reduced tariff regime to become internationally competitive; for example, in cereal production and dairying. Agricultural industries such as the dairy, sheep meat, beef and fruit industries are receiving their lowest levels of government sponsored assistance in decades.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our food processors face mature demand for their agribusiness products in the domestic market. They must export to survive. On the other hand, the domestic market is essential for some 30 per cent of the beef returns and over 50 per cent of sheep meat, dairy and fruit sales. The few fruit processors left in Australia have both branded and generic labels which they produce under licence for domestic retailers. Prices paid in the domestic branded and generic labelled markets give fruit processors like SPC and Ardmona in Shepparton and Mooroopna the returns to invest in new product research and development. This is essential if they are ever to compete internationally or, indeed, defend and grow their own market shares in Australia. If the domestic markets are corrupted by dumped product, the prices for all goods competing in that category are driven down and, as we have seen too often, the local manufacturer does not survive. When you have a manufacturer like a fruit processor cease to be in a region like Murray you lose jobs, you lose towns and you threaten the future of a region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Typically, one of the early industries to evolve in a newly industrialising country is large scale food processing. Canning technology, for example, is comparatively simple. The product has a long shelf life and does not depend on the cold storage that Third World kitchens typically lack. As levels of agricultural productivity improve, countries like China quite quickly turn to food preserving through 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> processes like canning to turn their surplus into opportunities for earning foreign currency. Australia is now seeing food importation competition from countries like the Philippines, China, Taiwan and the European Community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No Australian manufacturer can claim protection from competition from importations which conform with our health and safety regulations, are labelled according to our regulations and are priced appropriately. What our Australian industries should be able to insist on, however&mdash;and they do&mdash;is that anti-dumping regulations and processes are fast, can be put into effect simply and are fair and workable. These amendments move towards producing that sort of legislation. Just one season of unfair competition from dumped product can mean the end of an Australian manufacturer which could have survived under fair trade circumstances. We do not have any more time to get this right. Labor spent years thinking about it; we are taking action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These amendments, which recognise that an economy may be in transition and allow the use of surrogate markets for establishing normal values where the actual sector is still government influenced, are sensible and fair. They are also, of course, totally WTO consistent. We must also ensure that our Anti&hyphen;Dumping Authority and Customs have a realistic appreciation of how difficult it is for an Australian company to get the detailed data on normal values that they have to produce to prove their cases. For years, it has not been easy for Australian manufacturers, compared with other industries in other countries, to deal with the anti&hyphen;dumping laws and policies in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The authors of an article entitled `An evaluation of Australia's anti&hyphen;dumping and countervailing law and policy' which appeared in the October 1995 issue of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Journal of World Trade</EMPHASIS> concluded:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ADA went on to complete its inquiry and made a positive final finding imposing dumping and countervailing duties on imports of canned peaches from China, Greece and Spain.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">No wonder the industries of the era of the previous government were somewhat confused and vexed about how serious we were about effective anti-dumping legislation. Last year SPC and Ardmona asked for a continuation of the anti&hyphen;dumping and countervailing measures&mdash;given the automatic expiry of the measures after five years&mdash;using the unamended legislation that had been in place for quite a number of years. Over the five years, the European Community had continued with its system of fruit production processing subsidies, and they well and truly remain in place. In other overseas markets&mdash;for example, in Germany&mdash;my industry saw that China continued to sell canned fruit at a third of the price of the Australian product. Their assumption was that the product was being dumped, and therefore they alleged that dumping was continuing in those other markets overseas&mdash;in this case Germany.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the continuation of the measures to occur, the Australian companies had to produce data that showed that import prices potentially would be below the normal values of the product. Unlike in the initial case, Customs does not go to the foreign country to obtain the facts. It is incumbent on the Australian manufacturer to do the work to produce the data to prove the case. It is extraordinarily difficult for a small company&mdash;perhaps with only a handful of employees&mdash;to go offshore into perhaps China or parts of South America to produce data that is going to be convincing for the ADA and Customs in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Canned Fruit Industry Council of Australia, acting on behalf of SPC and Ardmona, engaged consultants in an attempt to help them. After this work was done, however, the measures against China in relation to canned pears were not continued. There is at the moment no protection in Australia 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11448"> should there be dumped product coming from China. The manufacturers will have to bring another case and, by the time they bring that case, the damage may be done. Meanwhile, the measures against Spain in relation to peaches were also not continued, but in the case of Greece, the ADA chose to continue the countervailing measures. Quite an extraordinary result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the statement of essential facts released in December 1996, the Anti&hyphen;Dumping Authority stated that the applicants, SPC and Ardmona:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . did not claim material injury to the industry producing canned peaches.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is part of the problem for Australia at the moment. We need to continue to work on our anti-dumping regulations&mdash;because how can you claim material injury in a continuation case when you have had five years of protection in the immediate past? It would be very difficult for any industry to claim material injury when arguing for a continuation. If the measures have worked at all, then the industry should not have suffered material injury in the time that the measures have been in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we still have to do some more work beyond these very necessary amendments to ensure the best possible anti-dumping measures are in force in Australia. Labor left us with a situation that concerns industry, and therefore must concern this nation. The new Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs (Mr Truss) is working as hard and as fast as he can to make sure this government has the very best legislation in the future. I therefore strongly support these amendments. I represent an electorate that is dependent on exports and is very vulnerable to dumping. People in my electorate strongly support these amendments. I commend the amendments to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is always a pleasure to enter into a debate in this place involving measures to combat anti-dumping because it has been&mdash;as was said by the last speaker in this debate, the member for Murray (Mrs Stone)&mdash;a vexed issue that has faced governments of all political persuasions. Cutting through the usual rhetoric&mdash;where the government would say, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> `You were in government for 13 years. Why didn't you do something about it?' and we would stand up and say, `But you've been there, coming in on the back of promises to do something. Why haven't you brought legislation through more quickly?'&mdash;and putting both sides of the argument to one side, it is important that we address the issues at hand. Measures are being addressed by the government at the moment which they believe will go part way to addressing some of the real problems facing the dumping of goods into Australia which would be to the detriment of Australian industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That said, I am sure the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs (Mr Truss) would not be surprised to find that I am in agreement with my colleague the member for Hotham (Mr Crean)&mdash;in that I say to him that the two private member's bills which stand in the name of the member for Hotham probably do go further than the government's present measures are proposing and actually contain some very reasonable measures which, I would hope, the minister would take on board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the honourable member for Murray's presentation, she talked about SPC and Ardmona and used as the case example the time that was taken for the Anti-Dumping Authority and the Australian Customs Service to become involved in looking at the problem; she talked about whether or not Australian Customs officials or Anti&hyphen;Dumping Authority officials actually travel overseas to try to investigate for themselves; and she said that reports are written to the minister and then other reports are written to the minister from the other authority, from a different department and so on. Listening to her presentation, I could not help but think it is no wonder that confusion does exist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why the member for Hotham has proposed that that split in the relationship be merged&mdash;that there be just one organisation that takes responsibility in the future for investigating and acting on anti-dumping measures. I cannot help but concur with that. He has suggested, and I am sure you will be delighted about this, that it reside within the Australia Customs Service and that Customs 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11449"> have that full responsibility, with the necessary resources to enable them to very quickly investigate the charges that are often brought by Australian companies that are starting to feel the pinch in respect of dumping issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those people who are not quite sure of what we are talking about here, I point out that we are talking about the fact that, at different times, Australian manufacturing companies and Australian rural producers believe that they are being subjected to competition which is unfair&mdash;competition which emanates from a foreign country, from foreign producers where the market in which they are located can in fact be corrupted. The member for Hotham spoke at length about the glyphosate issue and about the interpretation of China's present status&mdash;whether it is an economy in transition, a market economy or a command economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The simple fact is that, if you look at the way in which the political leaders of that nation would want to see China go at the moment, they want to have it as a mixed economy. Certainly, they want to see it moving very much to an economy which is earning foreign resources. They are embracing a form, I suppose, of more economic liberalisation&mdash;the likes of which have not been seen, certainly in that country, for quite some time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If one goes, particularly, to Southern China, although this is now an issue which is spreading throughout most of the country, one can see for oneself the way in which that is being embraced. That, in itself, is good in terms of raising economic and living standards for people in that country. But, by the same token, what it can do, when you take into consideration the manufacturing processes that are involved&mdash;and in the case of the example used by the member for Hotham, glyphosate, where directions were still being given in a planned economic way&mdash;is cause problems, particularly if the product that we are talking about then suddenly finds its way into Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If, as the member for Hotham has indicated, that has caused an Australian manufacturing operation to move offshore, that indeed is a great disadvantage for this country. I think 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> there is no doubt that in this place members on both sides recognise that there is, at the moment, something of a crisis of confidence in much of manufacturing industry in Australia. There is a crying need for an industry policy to come from the new government&mdash;an industry policy which says, in terms of manufacturing, that we clearly have in place assistance programs where required and the economy's fundamental right to give that support to industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part of that support mechanism that is necessary is protection from dumping. Part of that mechanism is the need to have in place a regime whereby, if a claim is made about economic disadvantage because of products being dumped in Australia&mdash;whether they be peaches and pears, which manifestly affect the producers in the member for Murray's electorate, or whether they be any other product that we are talking about&mdash;there is a process in place for a speedy resolution of those issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that the latest minister is aware of this because he commented upon it when in opposition. The member for Hotham referred to the fact that he stood up in this place and gave a passionate defence of the peanut growers in his electorate some time ago and, at the time, claimed that Australia was `a dumpers paradise' because of the dumping of Chinese peanuts. At the time, he went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Upon return to government, we will slash the amount of time taken to determine the anti&hyphen;dumping and countervailing cases and changes to the material injury test to ensure that an industry does not have to be decimated before remedial action can be taken. If there is any bias, it should be in favour of the Australian industry rather than the importer.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">These were very reasonable sentiments expressed by the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs at a time when he was on the back bench defending the peanut growers in his electorate. But as the member for Hotham has rightly pointed out, and has been pointed out in a series of articles in the media, it has taken a degree of time, and in some cases a bit of pushing and shoving and dragging three ministers kicking and screaming, to actually take some positive action by 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11450"> finally bringing to this place the legislation which we are debating today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might also say on that point that when the member for Hotham was making his contribution and said words to the effect, `It has taken a long time for this bill to actually get to the House. Why don't they hurry up and get it through if they are so concerned about this,' the minister for customs retorted words to the effect, `Why don't you bring it on in the Senate?' I might remind the honourable minister that it is the Liberal&hyphen;National parties that are the government and that in the Senate they and not the Labor Party, the opposition, control the way in which legislation is brought on for debate. It is not the opposition in this place that has control over that. That is why we have delays being occasioned in that place in respect of another piece of important legislation, which has finally seen the light of day over there today&mdash;and, of course, I am referring to the Wik bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no point in the good minister suggesting that we are causing delays. We are not. This bill was listed for debate in this place, I think, at least three times in the last six weeks and withdrawn at the last minute, not by the opposition but by the government. It is finally here now. It is a bit disingenuous for the minister to come into this place and say that the Labor Party is delaying its implementation and its passage and that if we had put it on the legislative program in the Senate it would have got through. I think the minister, as I say, is stretching it a touch there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not only the member for Hotham or me in my role as the shadow minister for customs and small business who have been raising some issues about this anti&hyphen;dumping issue. I refer the House to an article written by David Forman in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper on 5 November this year under the headline `Anti-dumping minefield explodes'. There are three pretty reasonable pictures there. I think the present minister would be quite happy. His smiling face looks out from the newspaper.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What it does do is illustrate that in the 20 months that this government has been in charge of the treasury bench there have been three ministers for customs dealing with these 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> issues. First it was the member for Forrest (Mr Prosser) who had responsibility in that area. He was the one responsible for the decision in respect of China that we are giving some consideration to today. As the member for Hotham rightly pointed out, we are trying to fix up the mess that was made because of changes to the DIFF program. When the Minister for Trade, the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer), was chatting with Madam Wu in Beijing he said, `We will try to do something for you. We will treat your economy slightly differently to the way we have in the past and the way we treat every other OECD nation in terms of anti&hyphen;dumping and that should satisfy you.' There was the trade&hyphen;off. That is how it has come to pass. Poor old Geoff Prosser was left to deal with that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After he went, Senator Chris Ellison became the new minister for customs. I think it was only a matter of weeks that he was in that portfolio. As David Forman reports in this article, there was an investigation in his time into the penalty duties due to expire applying to PVC from numerous countries. That article goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It recommended to Senator Chris Ellison that the duties be removed from all countries except Japan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">But Ellison ignored their advice in relation Canada, China, France and Thailand, extending duties against them. At least two&mdash;China and Canada&mdash;are understood to have written formal letters seeking an explanation, and others have made informal approaches to the Government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part of the Government's explanation to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Australian</EMPHASIS>  was that there was evidence of dumping into other markets by some from these countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">So, last year evidence that China was fixing export prices did not convince the Government not to be more lenient with its exports. But by this year Australia was willing to use the finding of another country's anti&hyphen;dumping authority ahead of the advice of its own authority.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That adds to the confusion that I am sure people in the business community, the small business community and the farming community have when they see anti&hyphen;dumping issues being raised and they see some differences of opinion and interpretation and, ultimately, decisions being taken by successive ministers in the same government. It might be well and good to stand up and level 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11451"> some criticism if it was ministers in different governments of different political persuasions, but when we are talking about changed decisions being made by ministers in the same government then people are entitled to ask a few questions about that. Another question arising out of this is the government's response to those countries that wrote in respect of that matter of PVC and whether or not the government has taken that on board as part of its decision in terms of the legislation that is with us today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a couple of other elements that are also worthy of touching on. I am sure every member of this place would have been following with some concern the Asian currency crisis, so&hyphen;described, that is affecting so many of our trading partners. You cannot help but ask the question: if IMF support is being sought for the likes of Indonesia, Thailand and even South Korea, economic difficulties are being experienced in Japan and real concern is being expressed for China as it embarks upon this march towards a much more liberalised economic regime, what happens in those countries if in order just to survive they suddenly decide they are going to export and dump in other countries product which will unfairly compete against locally manufactured goods?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is a real probability and an issue which I think the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs and the Anti&hyphen;Dumping Authority need to be extremely vigilant about. There is no doubt that, if we are seeing some fundamental problems in what had been described as the Asian tiger economies&mdash;emerging economies&mdash;and those with whom Australia, over the last 10 or so years, has been looking to cultivate very close trading relationships, we have to start to ask the question: should our anti&hyphen;dumping organisations, the Anti&hyphen;Dumping Authority and the Australian Customs Service, become a touch more vigilant about the potential for product being dumped in markets like Australia because of those concerns and those difficulties in those Asian economies?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other issue which is important and which I briefly touched on was the fact that a number of small businesses are affected by 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> anti&hyphen;dumping measures and by cases which are launched. The member for Murray rightly pointed out the difficulties that companies like SPC and Ardmona had in running anti&hyphen;dumping cases. You can imagine what small businesses have to experience as well. It is a costly exercise and to prove material injury is not an easy thing. As we have also seen, using the example that the member for Murray has used, to get agreement between the Anti&hyphen;Dumping Authority, the Australian Customs Services and then the variety of ministers that we have had in this portfolio is not an easy thing to achieve. As a consequence, if you are a small business that is trying to get into the export world and trying to utilise facilities that might be there to try to branch out and create jobs in Australia, they need to be aware that they are going to get some sort of protection from dumping of product in an unfair competitive environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As was said earlier, there have been delays in bringing this legislation through, but for small business that is nothing new. For example, at the end of this year we are still debating the fair trading legislation in this place. There is no chance of that getting through the Senate this year. It will get to the Senate some time in March at the earliest. There is also that secret little clause that no&hyphen;one seems to have picked up in the government's bill that says it does not take effect until six months after royal assent, yet somehow the good Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) has convinced the small business community that, come 1 July, all their problems are going to be solved. They are not. Again, the anti&hyphen;dumping bills that we have talked about are not going to get to the Senate this year. They are not going to be considered by the Senate this year. Because of the Constitutional Convention that has wiped out the two sitting weeks in February, it is going to be at least March before they are considered in that place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, the unfair dismissal laws in small business, which had a second run in this place yesterday, are not going to be debated here, I would imagine, in the next week or so&mdash;or they might if we are looking for fillers until 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11452"> the Wik legislation gets through. As for the Senate getting a second run on it, again it will be next year. The same goes for the changes that the government has now foreshadowed in its backdown over the choice of superannuation funds. Once again, all of these sorts of issues that this government said were priorities for small business&mdash;fair trading, anti-dumping, unfair dismissals, superannuation&mdash;have not been completed at the end of 1997, yet this government maintains that it can keep its legislative program on track.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said earlier, we have had three customs ministers dealing with the problems of anti&hyphen;dumping. In all of that time there has been only one industry minister, that is, John Moore. You have to ask the question: if Mr Truss had identified such a huge problem when he was a backbencher, as the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) remarked on a little earlier to the member for Murray and to the minister, why has it taken this long to get the legislation here to do something about it? If Mr Truss, now the minister for customs, had identified back in 1992 that this was a problem and reckoned that the government of the day did not do anything about it, why has it taken until the end of 1997, some 20-odd months following the election of this government, for the bill to come before us?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister for industry has not bothered to answer any questions in this place that have been posed to him on this issue. He simply squibs it every time the member for Hotham asks him a question on anything. It is becoming almost a waste of time to ask the minister for industry any questions because he certainly does not elicit any answers to very important matters that we have brought forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Hotham's own private members' bills are here. As I said in quite a genuine way to the minister before he left the chamber, we would maintain that all of what is in the member for Hotham's two private members' bills, which go to the issue of anti-dumping, needs to be addressed and should be picked up by the government. But it may be that only elements of those fit in with the government's policy. We understand that. That is politics. That is what creates an 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> opposition and a government. But it cannot all be bad. I would simply say to the minister for customs: have a look at what the member for Hotham is suggesting. It is extremely good legislation that he is proposing. Never mind the rhetoric about 13 years too late and all that sort of nonsense. The legislation is there and it is a genuine offer which I think the government should pick up. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

The purpose of these bills is to provide a new method for determining on a case by case basis the normal value of goods exported from countries whose economies are in transition from command to market economies and to ensure interim dumping and countervailing duties can be imposed prior to a final assessment of duties payable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the legislation stands, it has no provision to appropriately deal with goods from countries whose economies are in transition. Current methods are limited in their application because there is no flexibility available for investigating authorities to treat exports from country's whose economies are in transition differently from exports from other countries. The proposed amendments will bring the legislation in line to reflect the dynamic nature of world markets, ensuring our Australian industries remain protected from the illegal dumping of goods. The amendments will also clarify the manner in which interim dumping and countervailing duties are collected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Effective anti-dumping legislation is vital for our Australian industries, which trade in an increasing fiercely competitive global marketplace. Anti-dumping measures are essential to ensure fairness in international trade to protect our industry from unfair competition. These proposed changes are necessary to protect Australian industry, Australian jobs and Australian investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since 1921, Australia has legislated against the internationally recognised unfair trading practice of foreign countries dumping their products into Australian markets or, put 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11453"> simply, foreign countries selling their goods at prices lower than their normal value or the price paid on their  domestic market. The only result of such practices for our Australian industries has been to place our Australian products at a severe price disadvantage and to cause Australian companies severe financial hardship. If this situation were to be left any longer we would see Australian jobs at risk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the core of this problem has been the difficulty of establishing what is `normal value' of goods. The concept of a `normal value' has been one of the basic issues when determining whether dumping has occurred. In the case of command economies, anti-dumping action was required on the basis that prices and costs were not acceptable because of government control. Until recently, an alternative, surrogate market was usually selected and the `normal value' was determined as if the surrogate country was the export source. However, as countries such as China have undergone such dramatic economic changes, such a regimented approach is not only inappropriate but also unworkable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current legislation has provisions to deal with products from countries whose economies are government controlled and also has provisions to deal with countries whose economies are market based, but there is no provision for countries where state owned enterprises coexist in a market with joint venture enterprises and wholly owned foreign enterprises&mdash;all operating in the same market&mdash;within a country that is in transition from the controlled command economy to the market based economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This poses a problem. How are we meant to assess the normal value of goods from countries which are in transition? The answer is that we have been forced to treat their products as if they were from either a command economy or a market based economy like, for example, the United States. This is patently unfair and threatens the interests of Australian industries because transitional economies are influenced only partially by market forces, with government control still existing on the domestic selling prices of a significant number of products. To allow such products onto the Australian market without 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> appropriate duties would unfairly disadvantage Australian products and falsely lower prices. Australian industry is aware of countries whose economies are in transition and holds genuine concerns about the risk of their products being dumped into our markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rapidly changing Chinese economy is a case in point. I have recently been to China and seen first-hand the vast amount of foreign investment, especially in manufacturing and agriculture. There is no way that China can be described as still having a command economy, especially in the southern provinces. However, the Chinese government continues to have an influence over the economy through measures such as production controls and still determines or influences the prices of some products through the input costs of raw materials.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time, some regions have embraced the capitalist economy with such fervour that prices are genuinely determined by competitive market forces. This transition has significant implications for the treatment of anti-dumping cases in Australia. This is especially so when considering the spread of manufactured goods available from China, which has expanded so rapidly, as China has encouraged more foreign investment and replaces its state owned enterprises with joint venture enterprises. Two-way trade between Australia and China is valued at around $A7.8 billion. As a government, we must perform a delicate balancing act. We must continue to encourage and facilitate trade between countries but, at the same time, ensure that our industries are not disadvantaged from artificially low prices by ensuring that we have strong and effective anti-dumping measures in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is why this legislation is so important. There is an urgent need to have the legislation in place that allows countries such as China to be treated as countries whose economies are in transition from command to market economy. Any changes to the method of determining normal value of goods exported to Australia from transitional countries need to be flexible to accommodate the complex nature of industry ownership and production in these economies. For this reason, anti- 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11454"> dumping action needs to be done on a case by case basis with consideration of specific circumstances of certain goods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation will allow investigating authorities the flexibility to determine normal value by reference to other sources, not just surrogate information. These sources must be relevant and credible and can include information from, for example, trade journals as to the prevailing prices, other information relevant to the cost of production of the goods under inquiry and information supplied by the Australian industry in its dumping complaint.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am particularly pleased that the government has listened to the concerns of industry and will initiate further reform to assist our Australian industries. I refer to the concerns raised about not only government control over the domestic selling price of goods but also government control over the price of raw materials used in the manufacture of goods. Industry has argued the need to investigate the source of raw materials used as subsidised inputs that could lead to an artificially low domestic price for manufactured goods and therefore distort what was defined as normal value.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has listened to these concerns and agrees that investigators should be able to examine both the domestic selling price of any goods in question and the cost of significant raw material inputs in the production of those goods. Such a method of assessment would enable anti-dumping investigators to examine raw material inputs into the production of allegedly dumped goods when that raw material input is supplied to the manufacturer by a state owned enterprise and the cost of that raw material input exceeded, for example, 10 per cent of the total production cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of the day, the amended bill will give the minister the flexibility to use a range of options when determining normal value appropriate to each situation. The legislation will permit different methods to be applied in determining normal values for each exporter. Not only will this result in a quicker decision but also industry will be assured that all relevant factors have been taken into consideration, in stark contrast to practices of the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> past. There is no doubt that there is a need for greater flexibility in our anti-dumping laws to cater for countries in transition from command to market economy. Industry needs legislative certainty in which to operate in global markets and to make decisions. This legislation will provide that certainty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In keeping with this objective, the bill proposes to amend the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act 1975 to clarify the way that interim dumping duties and countervailing duties are collected. The effect is to ensure that duties can be imposed in respect of exported goods to Australia prior to a final assessment of duties payable on those goods. These changes will clear up the ambiguities of the current measures and provide provisions which will commence retrospectively. This will ensure that duties collected since the commencement of the provisions, which was 1 January 1993, are not subject to legal challenge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The introduction of provisions for transitional economies and the clarification of anti-dumping duties have been widely embraced and supported by industry. This is evident in ICI Plastics' submission to the Senate Selection of Bills Committee in September, which stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The need to introduce effective legislation as soon as practicable cannot be over&hyphen;emphasised. A number of Australian manufacturers have fallen foul of the current legislative void with many more awaiting implementation of effective legislation which provides an element of certainty of process before proceeding with applications.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This legislation has implications for the future profitability and investment plans of every Australian industry that competes with products, be they in a raw or manufactured state, from countries in transition, such as China. If we are to operate in a global, free trade environment, it must be on a fair basis. As a government, we must be able to undertake anti-dumping investigations on a case by case basis in relation to transitional economies to ensure that our anti-dumping laws provide a fair and effective trading environment and legitimate safeguards for our industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue of anti-dumping is one of balance between facilitating trade between countries and ensuring that our Australian industries are 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11455"> not disadvantaged because goods are dumped on our market at unfair and distorted prices. This legislation achieves this balance, because it effectively deals with a major anomaly that has been allowed to distort the global market. This stands in stark contrast to the neglect and inactivity of the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I listened with great attention to the comments made previously by the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) and the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin). I refer specifically to some of the comments made by the member for Hotham. In his address to this House, he had the audacity to say that the opposition had taken the initiative in this debate. How the member for Hotham has the audacity to stand in this place and make comments like that is absolutely beyond me, especially when we remember that it was the member for Hotham in the previous government who had direct responsibility in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Hotham went on to comment about the possible loss of investment and jobs. He also had the temerity to speak about regional development that had been lost. I stand in this place representing the electorate of McEwen, a very large and diverse rural regional electorate of Victoria, where so many businesses in past years had to operate under the administration of the previous government. They had to compete so unfairly. They had so many pressures put on them by the previous government, particularly by the member for Hotham. It was the deliberate policy action of the previous government that caused so many of my farmers and small businesses to go to the wall. Here this morning we had the member for Hotham, of all people, stand in this place and criticise this government, which has only been in office for 20 months, for inaction which has caused people in my electorate to go to the wall. The hypocrisy of the member for Hotham knows no bounds whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While he spoke in very moderate terms, I would have to say that the member for Cunningham really falls into the same category as well. As the current shadow minister for small business, how dare the member for Cunningham have the audacity to stand in this place and ask us as a government where our 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> priorities are for small business when he was a member of a government that for 13 years conducted inquiry after inquiry into small business. The previous government conducted approximately 17 different inquiries over 13 years. What, might I ask, was the result of all those 17 inquiries? The result was absolutely zilch, nil. No action whatsoever was taken on behalf of small business. They are the very people that this legislation we are introducing is designed to assist. It is designed to protect them from unfair trading practices. How dare the member for Cunningham make comments like that. I would like to know exactly where the priorities are of those who sit opposite. Time after time, we listen in this place to each member of the opposition criticise us as a government for inaction when they had 13 years in government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is all very well for the member for Cunningham to say in his opening comments, `Look, let's put all of this aside.' I cannot do that. I would be lacking in my responsibility to the people I represent in my electorate of McEwen if I did not stand in this place and remind those who sit opposite that it was their inactivity, their neglect, their lack of prioritising what was needed for small business in this country, that placed so many of the people in my electorate at risk.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is obvious that this government is suffering from stunned mullet syndrome. The members of the government are acting like a bunch of stunned mullet. They are unconscious. To follow the member for McEwen (Mrs Bailey), it is interesting to look at the falsity of the allegations that were made regarding reports. The high dudgeon and sheer ignorance which have been shown in this debate is really quite tragic. Anyone reading the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  or listening to the speeches would wonder what we are arguing about because it appears that we are all saying the same thing. That is because the ignorance of those opposite is so manifest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government started off with a mad rush last year. The question of dumping and anti&hyphen;dumping goes back a long way. The legislation we are amending was passed in 1975, but it goes back more than 50 or 60 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11456"> years. Every country has problems of that nature, and those problems keep changing. We were not surprised when the government initiated an inquiry last year into anti&hyphen;dumping measures. If we had been in government, we would have done the same. We have had regular inquiries into dumping because it is something that should be looked at regularly, and by people outside the system, because there tends to be a lot of vested interest and a lot of institutionalised thinking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Willett report was produced for the government in September of last year. This was a major achievement&mdash;a review of dumping measures with a view to tightening them up to make them more effective. What happened? The report hit the wall. Not one of the 23 recommendations has been put to this House by the government. The government is a stunned mullet, an unconscious fish. It is a government in suspension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was a mad rush to review a major area for the economy and for our community. The report was very proactive and positive. What happened? It was shelved. Then a speaker in this place talks about inquiries into small business&mdash;falsely, deceitfully and wrongly&mdash;in speaking about amendments which should be about the Willett report, but which are not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for McEwen criticised the member for Hotham (Mr Crean), who has actually started to move on the Willett report recommendations by putting forward legislative proposals that would enact the recommendations which the government received over a year ago. She then stood in high dudgeon and talked about audacity. The members of the government are stunned mullet&mdash;that is the only way to understand it. Nothing else makes any sense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">International trade is complex and it is constantly changing. I cannot recall the number of times that I have spoken in this House on dumping measures, because every month there is a different issue, a different measure. For example, let us look at light globes. Light globes might be fairly simple things&mdash;and we all get flashes of inspiration&mdash;but in trade terms they are very complex.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you go to the supermarket you will see light globes made in Australia, light globes made in Brazil, Italy, Belgium, France or almost anywhere in the world. Shoppers do not ponder why this is so, they basically just want to buy a light globe. But there are industry implications of that. When there are only a small number of light globe manufacturers in the world, there is a constant battle for market share and problems with what to do with oversupply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over time, governments of both persuasions have battled this problem of having light globes brought into the country effectively at dumped prices. If one takes action on Belgium, hey presto, the next week they are coming from Italy. If one takes action on Italy, then they come in from Brazil&mdash;often from the same company, which simply shifts its sources around the globe. A constant process of change is going on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had a hiatus for two years in this place. Since this time in 1995, parliament has been in suspension. The members of the government are a bunch of stunned mullet. They started off with the Willett report last September. We all though that was terrific and that we would finally see some action and would be able to catch up, because in this business you have to keep running because the world is moving all the time. We have stood still as a country, just like stunned mullet caught in the spotlights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Read the speech of the previous minister for small business and customs, Mr Prosser, who brought in the legislation. He was caught in the spotlights in June. We had this great fanfare with the Willett report and its implications. What came out of it? Capital `F' Flexibility which, translated to industry, means capital `U' Uncertainty. This legislation does not provide a better environment. It is simply legislation that does something, but it does not produce certainty and it does not improve the investment environment or the trading environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All that bluster, hyperbole and hype that went on for months and months as to how, somehow, the Labor Party was pro dumping in this country and how we had somehow been negligent, ended up with the damp squib 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11457"> of this legislation. To his credit, the member for Hotham has proposed an amendment to the bill which those opposite should understand and accept. That amendment goes to certainty so that it is absolutely clear to everybody how it is going to work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The idea that the minister is going to decide how to apply and interpret this legislation is terrifying to most businesses. Quite frankly, it should be terrifying to a minister. The potential for competing interests, competing lobbying and competing claims, institutionally and publicly, is horrendous and represents a quagmire of possible litigation and absolute uncertainty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sophistication of modern trade and manufacturing investment within and between countries is immense. The idea that somehow a minister sits in Canberra in his little ivory tower saying, `I know that 10 per cent of this investment is out of Taiwan, 35 per cent is out of Singapore, 40 per cent is out of Hong Kong and it's all affecting the price of goods made in China; I know all of that, I will therefore determine it,' is absolute nonsense. It is absolutely laughable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tragedy is that we do not get many chances to amend the anti&hyphen;dumping measures because they are always difficult. This is one of those critical times. If we do not lay down to the markets very clearly and absolutely what the position is, the opportunity will not just be lost, it will be wasted. It becomes counterproductive, so this worsens the situation rather than improving it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that at the moment, for example, Australia is receiving dumped steel, but the complexity of proving that is enormous. It would take an enormous amount of time to prove it. The current measures are probably insufficiently sophisticated to handle what is going on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time, we no longer export steel to America. Why? Because Americans have taken anti&hyphen;dumping action against BHP. Five or six years ago, we were building up excellent export markets in America. I have referred to this in previous speeches. That was going very well. There was scope in America for specialised steels and particular kinds of steel that we were developing very well. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> America was becoming a very important marketplace for us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at the graphs and charts on exports to America, the anti&hyphen;dumping action and the countervailing measures and duties that were being imposed, those exports were wiped out virtually overnight because the risks were so great. With regard to America, which espouses free trade, we have a $12 billion a year trade deficit&mdash;we import $12 billion a year more from them than they import from us. We were building a relatively small market, involving a few hundred thousand tonnes of steel a year. What happened? Down came the shutters. It was not sophisticated; it was pretty brutal. But it was supported by their government. And we sit back here like a bunch of stunned mullet. It is absolutely tragic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to this debate, there is no doubt that members on both sides of the parliament want to prevent dumping. Why didn't we put the recommendations of the Willett report into legislation? No&hyphen;one has explained that. Not one speaker on the other side has even referred to it. There was no mention of it in the minister's second reading speech. What was the point of commissioning the report?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all understand there will be a need for constant and ongoing change in anti&hyphen;dumping measures because there is a constant change in international trading patterns. Companies move faster than governments. They always have and they always will. We are always playing catch&hyphen;up. While we are catching up, our businesses are suffering. We have had a two&hyphen;year gap, a two&hyphen;year pause, while those opposite, who were like racing greyhounds rushing off into the field after the prey, turned into a bunch of stunned mullet who did nothing. This is an insult to our businesses and to the issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I urge those opposite who share my concerns about dumping measures to understand that they are being conned. This is not a political issue; this is an issue of survival for many businesses. Certainly, in terms of investment, it is absolutely fundamental. They should go back to their party rooms and say to the ministers, `We want the Willett report recommendations implemented now.' It was 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11458"> brought down in September last year and there has been no sign of any action with regard to it. Why not? If it was worth having it, why wasn't it worth doing something about it? The fact that nothing has been done is a tragedy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have already referred to the fact that the member for Hotham has moved an amendment which would give some certainty. We still need to go further. We have tried to fix this part of the problem by way of legislation but there is more to it. The member for Hotham has introduced legislation in response to the Willett report because the government has not done so. That bill is now even more important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know we are seen to be in an adversarial position. I know the perception is that whatever the government proposes, we oppose. That is absolutely not true. An enormous number of things are agreed on in this parliament. Right now, one of the biggest issues facing the whole world with respect to trade and international relations is the insecurity in the financial and banking institutions in Asia. The federal government has given support to Thailand, Indonesia and now to Korea. It would have been easy for us to oppose that measure. Politically, we probably would have won lots of kudos for it, but it would not have been good economics. So we have gone into bat for you guys because you handled it so badly. We have gone in and supported you because you have handled it so incompetently.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is we are genuinely concerned about trying to get good outcomes for this country in important legislative and policy areas. To be lectured to by those opposite on this legislation in the way that has been done is not just insulting, it is dumb. They are stunned mullet; nothing else could describe them. They do not understand the problem; therefore, they do not understand the solutions that are available. They are all reading from the same script, written by someone who was out to mislead them. They are not reading their own scripts. It is all the same mantra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They all end up saying that this problem has come about after 13 years. The fact is, the problem we have now, compared with 13 years ago, has changed 13 or 14 times. It will 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> change again next year and the year after, and two or three times per year for ever and ever. It has done so every year for 40 or 50 years. It is a question of how fast we can move.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are facing now, as a small country in a very large world where individual companies are bigger than us by far, where our economy is dwarfed by the turnover of the big multinationals who trade around the world, where the bulk of world trade is within companies rather than between companies, where we are a relatively small but very honest player in this business, where we are very transparent with very open systems, is that we are in danger of being very dumb.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of our processes go through this kind of public debate. Hence the reason why governments use people like Willett&mdash;we have used others in the past&mdash;and various other forms of third party analysis or examination of our processes and procedures. Those processes are so important, and it is why so often, on things like Willett, like Mortimer, and various other reports which have been done for the government, you find the opposition agreeing with the bulk of the recommendations and saying, `Yes, we agree. A third party analysis has been done. We've looked at that objectively. That makes sense. Bring it forward and we will support it.' Why not on dumping?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are not opposing it; we are trying to do what Willett was trying to do and what you guys have ignored. We had a bipartisan committee on small business which you, Mr Acting Speaker Reid, chaired. It was referred to earlier in the debate by your colleagues, so I am not straying from debate on the legislation. We worked with the government members on that. We were virtually outnumbered two to one&mdash;nine to five. We ended up with a bipartisan conclusion. We started in May of last year, tabled in May of this year and we are only just getting to debate the legislation for the first time this week. Of course, it will not get to the Senate until next year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that bipartisan committee we travelled the country talking to people: experts and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11459"> straightforward business people. The government left out key parts of the recommendations. The fact is, they gutted the key parts, they delayed the legislation, and at the same time they ask us for bipartisanship. When we give bipartisanship, what happens? The government plays politics with it. The government should bring forward the recommendations of the Willett report or support the legislation of the member for Hotham.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On fair trading, the government should accept the amendments in the Senate to restore the committee recommendations in full, as we did. I get the feeling we live in different worlds. I sat through days of discussions with government members on the fair trading report.

Obviously, there is a lot of bipartisan support for the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R247">Customs Legislation (Anti&hyphen;Dumping) Amendment Bill 1997</XREF> . I commend the member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) for his contribution. However, I say to the member for Newcastle that this mullet is moving in regard to his remarks that this government has been a stunned mullet on the issue of anti&hyphen;dumping. That is not the case, as I will establish during this debate. He also said in regard to stunned mullet that five years ago there was an anti&hyphen;dumping order put against this country with respect to steel with which he is particularly involved, being the member for Newcastle. He actually said that his government had been stunned mullet on the issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I concur with the remarks of the member for McEwen, Fran Bailey, when she said it was a bit rich for the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) who had, in a previous government, responsibility for this issue and had failed to move in the direction in which he now intends to move through his private members bill. These are important issues to very reasonable people across this nation. I say `reasonable people' because I do not like to call them `ordinary Australians'. The people who work in industries such as pulp 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11460"> and paper manufacturing are not ordinary Australians. They are defending themselves at all times against unfair dumping into this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer at this point to the A team that I have been working with since becoming member for McMillan. The A team stems from the Australian paper manufacturing plant at Morwell. Those people are absolutely dedicated to the cause of protecting their own jobs. I think that it is appropriate, it is right, for people to work with their local member through the process of government. That is why I get annoyed when I hear the member for Newcastle saying, `Look, you're stunned mullet on the issue.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has been moving progressively forward on the issue under the World Trade Organisation rules. We are not offending. We can move forward. Equally, the member for Hotham  has a right to make a contribution in this House on what he believes would be the best way to go at this time. Today a number of members have raised the point that, in regard to anti&hyphen;dumping, companies move quicker than governments. Yes, we have restrictions on us. Yes, there are processes that have to be followed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Newcastle said, `Australia is a small but honest player in the world of trade.' Trade is particularly important, though, to people in Gippsland. I see political shenanigans and political games being played. Everybody has a right to play the games. The member for Hotham has the right to play his games. The member for Newcastle has the right to play his games.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am actually very supportive of this legislation. I think the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) will give reasonable consideration to the bill put forward by the member for Hotham. If any member raises anything in this House that can be an advantage to jobs generated in Australia, then let us get together and support it. There has been a lot of bipartisan effort in regard to anti&hyphen;dumping. The government, rightly, now has the responsibility and we are working effectively and with genuine intent to make a difference in places like my seat of McMillan.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I read in my local paper that the union wants support for paper anti&hyphen;dumping bills. The paper says that these bills will be introduced into the parliament and that they have the support of local groups. As the member for McMillan, I am very supportive of the CFMEU&mdash;the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union&mdash;and the efforts they have put into holding their jobs, looking after their jobs, in the industry. They have the support of Maryvale's A team. The team consists of a group of people who work on issues like this. They come together to look after Australian jobs in regional areas. It stems from the fact that there can be community input and support from the union as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Newcastle talked about the `stunned mullet government'. This anti&hyphen;dumping legislation is absolutely an important part of what the Howard government has been doing in regional areas. The Howard government has directly supported the dairy industry. They went down there. They said, `We've got farmers in trouble down there. It is a regional area. We care about jobs in regional areas. We'll support the farmers.' We put a teleservice centre down there for Centrelink. We have the talent, the ability, the assets and the expertise to put in place a service centre for the Department of Social Security that will, I think, be the envy of the nation. It will supply another 140 or 150 jobs, and there is an opportunity for growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has this government done about the timber industry in east Gippsland? We implemented the regional forest agreement. It has made a big difference to jobs in Gippsland. But we cannot have jobs affected by other countries dumping on us in such a way that the investment of $360 million in a new plant in Gippsland is threatened. The plant is almost at the point of completion. If other countries dump their paper at unfair prices which do not reflect its normal value it is absolutely right for this nation to say, `No, hold on a minute. We know what it costs to produce the paper. You're either getting the raw material at a price that is inappropriate or you're selling under value through support from the government of another nation.' That is what is happening.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11461">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Murray (Mrs Stone) made a very important point in her address. In fact, her whole address was very good. She said, `Let's get it right on this legislation.'  Even if the government does hasten slowly on this issue, I would rather get the legislation right than have to come back to this parliament and say, `We made a mistake here. We could have tweaked it here. We could have done something there.' It is very important that this government gives appropriate consideration to the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that this government is currently working on a response to the Willett report and, in the fullness of time, we will see the results of that. We are not only a small player in this but also world's practice. We are world's best practice in our timber industry but somebody else is dumping paper on this nation. I do not want to get off the subject, but it is not only the dumping of paper that is an issue; it is also the labelling on the product that comes in, purporting that it is `just about' Australian made. Of course, it is the printing on the label over the top that can be misleading.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, we are world's best practice in the industry. Paper is a waste product. Some of the paper that we produce in Gippsland is from waste product of the timber industry. In the timber industry we have people such as Trevor Smith, Drouin West Sawmills and the Stoll Brothers. Their waste products go into the manufacture of paper. Most of the paper used in this House is made in one of our Australian mills. This government, this party, intends to use Australian paper whenever we possibly can unless some unusual paper is needed. It should also be remembered that we import some pulp from places such as Indonesia. It is a two&hyphen;way stream. We judge what we need to do as a nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We cannot be accused of inactivity on this issue. Today the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> said that Customs have found that certain coated wood&hyphen;free paper sheets from Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Republic of Korea, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Taiwan have been exported to Australia at dumped prices since 1 January 1996, so we are on guard.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to Chris Moody and his A team: congratulations on the work that you are doing through your local member, through your unions, through your support programs. I believe they are coming here next week to again put their case about the importance of this anti&hyphen;dumping legislation, how it affects them and the threat to jobs in Gippsland because of this dumping. I do not to belabour that; I want to talk about this particular piece of legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) took a very conciliatory line today by saying, `Forget that we were in government for 13 years. I really do not want to talk about that at this stage.' He took a bipartisan attitude. In fact, I thought he was going to debunk the member for Hotham. I hope that the member for Hotham was saying, `Now I am free from the  cabinet solidarity that I had to impose upon myself prior to the government falling, I am now free to support jobs in Gippsland in a genuine way.' I will work with anybody if I can create one more job in Gippsland after the restructure of the power industry and the issues that we have been through down there. I hope that he is genuinely supporting jobs and investment in Gippsland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I notice that there are a number of children watching the proceedings today from the gallery. We cannot afford not to have this legislation go through, because this is about generations of people who will receive jobs, not just about the jobs that are in Gippsland today. It is about the investment that comes through a community working together to make sure that there are jobs for this and the next generation because we are good at something. We have to ensure that we are not be knocked off by another country which dumps a whole lot of their product into this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Cunningham rightly mentioned the problems in east Asia now which will put a whole new complexion on governments trying to get their goods out at any price to get some money in to make a difference in their nation. So we have to be vigilant about what is coming into this country and how we judge what the normal price for the product will be in that country. We cannot 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11462"> allow ourselves to not be watching very closely what the normal price in that country should be. If they are dumping, we have to be on to it as quickly as we possibly can, having regard for the changes that will come forward as time goes on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dumping is defined as `selling goods in foreign markets at prices lower than achieved in the home market and causing material injury to industries in the importing countries'. That is why I am on my feet as the member for McMillan to say that there is a community under threat from goods coming into this nation that are unfairly marketed and thrown into this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since 1922 Australia has legislated against the internationally recognised unfair trading practice of foreign countries dumping their products in Australian markets. While we will continue to recognise the World Trade Organisation&mdash;formerly known as GATT&mdash;we have applied the code of practice which countries are required to observe in relation to the practice of dumping and which administers uniformity in the way that countries govern their anti&hyphen;dumping laws. It ensures that any anti&hyphen;dumping action taken in a particular place is not a barrier to trade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we are not saying at any time that we will put up a trade barrier. We do not mind competition. Competition is good. It creates opportunities and investment. We have accepted that we are not putting up a trade barrier. We are saying, `Do not treat us unfairly.' I notice that because you are in the chair, Mr Deputy Speaker Reid, your report on a fair deal for small business had been raised. I am talking here today specifically about a fair deal for Australian workers under anti&hyphen;dumping legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose of these bills is to provide a new method for determining normal value in respect of goods exported from countries whose economies are in transition from command to market economies and to ensure that anti&hyphen;dumping and countervailing duties can be imposed prior to final assessment of the duties payable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are changes going on all over the world. It was mentioned before that companies change more quickly than nations can 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> change. I mentioned before that we have to be vigilant about where we are going and what we are doing. But, importantly, because of the changes overseas&mdash;and we see from our daily papers they are happening every day and companies are responding to what is happening in their economies, China being a very good example&mdash;Australia has to position itself appropriately with regard to the goods that come into this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We still have a huge deficit in paper products, and we are going to need these companies into the future. As much as this is about jobs in the future it is also about major investment. I repeat that the $360 million new investment in the Latrobe Valley is not peanuts. And it is not toy organisations that we are talking about here; we are talking about a major company with a huge number of employees, all of whom have families. It is a major regional effort that needs to be protected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The members who have spoken previously raised a couple of matters that I would like to address. Australia is under threat from dumping in a number of areas. We mentioned that steel had been stopped from going overseas five years ago. It was also mentioned that governments have been constantly dealing with these issues. Since I can remember, there has been some legislation going through about how we can protect ourselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a government that is moving very effectively and very efficiently on anti&hyphen;dumping. There are those who, for political reasons, will criticise the approach that we are taking, but we are going to take the people with us as we go and we are going to make sure that jobs and opportunities are protected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's intention in these bills is to cater for, as I said before, the movement of economies. Industry has said that anti&hyphen;dumping duties are not de facto customs tariffs, and industry representatives maintain that while Australian industry may be assisted to some extent by various levels of customs tariffs anti&hyphen;dumping duties are important in relation to specific cases of countries importing certain goods. Industries believe that the customs tariff would be instantly eroded by a dumping case. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11463">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there is some urgency, and I recognise that. The need to introduce effective legislation as soon as practicable cannot be overemphasised. A number of Australian manufacturers have fallen foul of the current legislative void with many more awaiting implementation which provides for an element of certainty of process before proceeding with the applications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I raise this because on my return to the parliament in 1996 I watched companies work through the difficulties and complexities of an anti&hyphen;dumping case. First, they have got to find out what the normal price is of the product overseas. The product may have hit the market already, so the length of time that it takes this nation to respond to an anti&hyphen;dumping call is important to what is happening. You can have three, four or five months in which the price of a particular commodity that is dealt around the world drops on your local market. If you have not got continuity, especially in the production of paper products, which involves those companies running 12&hyphen;hour shifts 24 hours a day, you have a real problem on your hands. You have an enormous amount of stocks coming through all the time and your sales have disappeared completely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That threatens the confidence of the people who make the big decisions that enhance the opportunities in regional Australia. Mr Deputy Speaker, you would understand, coming as I do from a regional area, that confidence is absolutely crucial to investment decisions for major companies. As I have highlighted before, a $360 million investment in a paper production plant, along with the plants that currently exist in Gippsland, is not small money. It is a big opportunity and it is the sort of investment that we need in Australia. We have the assets in Gippsland. We have the water. We have the talented people. We have the weather. We have the power. The opportunities are there. Not only are the opportunities there but they are enhanced by government decisions to protect jobs in Australia without moving away at any stage from allowing a threat to those job opportunities and a threat to that investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is moving cautiously towards the best outcome on anti&hyphen;dumping 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cases. We will not be rolled. We will not be knocked over. The Howard government&mdash;as you will see as these bills progress&mdash;has a grand opportunity to send a message out to regional Australia, and that is: those of you in timber are important; Mr Dairyman, you are important too; and the worker in the APM mill is very important to us. We have really stood up a couple of times recently on the greenhouse gas issue and said, `Hey, I am supporting the power industry workers in Latrobe Valley too.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the previous government&mdash;if I can be critical for a moment; those sitting opposite will not mind that, I am sure&mdash;those people in Gippsland actually felt let down after 13 years. They felt that the government was not delivering for them. They had taken their eye off the ball. We have not. We have actually said on greenhouse gas issues that we are going to support our workers in Gippsland. Now we have said it on pulp and paper. We will continue to support workers in Gippsland. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R247">Customs Legislation (Anti&hyphen;Dumping) Amendment Bill 1997</XREF>  and the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R246">Customs Tariff (Anti&hyphen;Dumping) Amendment Bill 1997</XREF>  are designed to do two things. The first is to correct an anomaly that arises from a grammatical error while the second is much more substantive. That part which aims to correct the grammatical error in the primary legislation might appear innocent enough, but it may be sufficient merely to comment that the financial impact of the error is theoretically very large indeed. Having said that, my comments will be essentially in relation to the other bill. The background to the bill, against which it should be considered, may need dwelling upon, as did the previous speaker, the honourable member for McMillan (Mr Broadbent), to some extent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Goods are dumped when they are exported from one country to another at prices less than their normal value. Australia can take anti&hyphen;dumping action when as a result of the dumping material injury has been or is being caused to an Australian industry producing similar goods or when the establishment of a industry producing such goods has been or 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11464"> may be materially hindered. Australia's anti&hyphen;dumping law is the product of our obligations under the old General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, now in the embrace of the World Trade Organisation, its anti&hyphen;dumping code and the code on subsidies and countervailing duties. The Customs Act 1901 and the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act 1975 are the principal legislative instruments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where an Australian company lodges an application claiming dumping with the Anti&hyphen;Dumping Authority, the ADA, which administers Australia's anti&hyphen;dumping system, the ADA must first determine whether there are sufficient grounds to initiate an investigation. Within the statutory period allowed for consideration of a claim, the ADA considers matters including the adequacy of the price evidence produced and whether there is a causal link between the alleged dumping and injury to an Australian industry. Countervailing duties are duties imposed on imports to offset foreign government subsidies to producers or exporters in the exporting country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At this point the House should be aware of the promise made by the government in its election policy, Reviving the Heartland, by reference to the administrative processes for dealing with dumping complaints. In the section headed `Fair Trade', the coalition promised, amongst other things, to reduce the inquiry period for anti&hyphen;dumping cases so that the preliminary complaints screening takes a maximum of five working days, the preliminary investigation takes up to 60 days, with an extension in special circumstances, and the interim measures then imposed, pending the completion of a final investigation, within a further 90 days. That, if observed in the breach, would ensure the maximum total investigation period is 155 days in other than exceptional circumstances compared with the now 245 to 265 days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 13 December 1996, the then minister responsible for Customs, the honourable member for Forrest (Mr Prosser), announced that the government would shorten the time frame not to 155 days as promised but to 215 days. The then minister went on to say that the government had decided to refer Australia's anti-dumping arrangements to the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Productivity Commission for report in 1997 and that the government would not move for the full reduction of the investigation process until after the commission reported. Despite that, the matter has not been formally referred yet because the terms of reference for the Productivity Commission have not been settled. The length of time to make a finding on an anti-dumping complaint is of concern to Australian companies, and excessive delay in investigating a dumping case will inevitably damage Australian industry. The government is urged to act on its election promise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One cannot determine that goods are being dumped unless it can be shown that they are being exported at a price less than their normal value. Generally, the method used to determine normal value is to consider the price paid in the exporting country. Other methods though include constructing a value from the costs of production and administration and other general costs, allowing for profit, or applying the price paid for similar goods sold into a third country. Where insufficient information has been supplied or is simply not available, the minister determines normal value, having regard to all relevant available information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A specific subsection in the Customs Act sets out the methods to be used by the ADA to determine the normal value of goods exported by a country with a centrally planned economy where the government has a monopoly or a substantial monopoly of the trade of the country and determines or substantially influences the domestic price of all goods in that country. The methods that must be used to calculate normal value in these circumstances include using the price payable for similar goods produced or manufactured in Australia and sold on the home market, and the price of similar goods produced or manufactured in a third country, determined by the minister, for sale on that country's home market. This latter calculation method is known as the surrogate country method.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the existing legislation makes no provision for countries that are in transition from centrally planned to market economies. Until the end of 1996, the surrogacy method was used to ascertain normal values for goods 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11465"> exported from economies in transition. However, in December 1996 counsel from the Office of International Law in the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department advised the ADA that the subsection of the Customs Act relating to command economies was very limited and narrow in scope. Counsel advised that the stringent tests of the subsection required that the government of export have at least a substantial monopoly of the trade of the country, not just in terms of the goods in dispute. Counsel commented that the provision could only rarely apply today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the principal bill, Dr Frances Perkins, the assistant secretary and head of the East Asia Analysis Unit in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, gave evidence before the Senate Economics Legislation Committee in September of this year about the nature of the Chinese economy. Dr Perkins's evidence was that China could no longer be classified as a centrally planned economy. She said that the World Bank and the IMF regarded China as an economy in transition and she provided statistical evidence of the nature of China's market to confirm that proposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the legal opinion it provided, the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department advised that, therefore, on the basis of this assessment by DFAT `it is difficult to see' how the subsection in the Customs Act used for command economies could be applied in China's case. On the basis of that advice, the government came to the view that to continue, for the purposes of anti-dumping legislation, to treat China as a centrally planned economy would raise the possibility of a legal challenge. The alternatives were to treat China and other transitional economies as full market economies, such as Japan and the United States, or to amend the legislation. Clearly, the Chinese economy cannot be treated as a market economy, with its domestic prices taken into account for the assessment of normal values. In my view it is clear that, with such a choice, the legislation has to be amended&mdash;if not whilst going through the parliament on this occasion, in the very near future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue then is how China should be regarded for anti-dumping purposes. The 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government's proposal is to deal with each anti-dumping complaint on a case by case basis. The explanatory memorandum to the principal bill notes that this reflects the viewpoint that the focus is not on the economy as a whole in an exporting country with a transitional economy, but on whether the selling prices of particular goods are subject to government control. The bill provides that, if a price control situation exists in relation to goods, then the minister will determine the normal value of the goods, taking into account all relevant information. While the bill does not specify what is meant by the term `all relevant information', it expressly leaves it open to the minister to use the surrogacy method of calculating normal values.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill defines what is a price control situation but does not state who has the responsibility for assessing whether such a situation exists. The price control situation exists when the domestic selling prices of the goods or similar goods are controlled in whole or in part by the government in the exporting country. The minister's office advises that in all cases this assessment will be made by the minister's delegate, the Director of Operations of Customs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a two&hyphen;step process: firstly, an assessment by a customs official of whether a foreign government has played a controlling role in depressing the level of domestic selling prices of particular goods in that country; and, secondly, if a positive finding is made, an assessment by the minister, by unspecified methods, of the normal value of the goods. Industry has been very critical of this approach, saying it does not provide certainty nor does it ensure fair competition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An industry anti&hyphen;dumping task force, through its chairman, Mr Bruce McAllen, gave evidence before the Senate Economics Legislation Committee about this bill on 22 September 1997. Mr McAllen told that Senate committee that industry does not object to according free market status to industry sectors in transitional countries where those sectors exhibited free market characteristics. However, Australian industry is concerned about the inability of customs officials to detect the presence of government subsidised 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11466"> raw materials upstream, in the case of a privatised enterprise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another major concern raised by that industry task force is that no test is set down for the calculation of normal values for goods. It is difficult for an Australian company to provide supporting evidence for a complaint if the act refers only to `all relevant information'. The industry task force is of the view that the surrogate country method has been shown to provide more certainty in assessing normal values in the case of a price control situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The industry task force has proposed its own two&hyphen;step test for assessing normal values in a country which has an economy in transition. The key to the industry proposal is the identification of foreign government ownership or control of the goods being produced or the supply of significant raw materials to the manufacturing sector in which the goods are produced. The industry task force defines `significant raw materials' as any single element in excess of 10 per cent of production cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The task force says that when this finding has been made there should then be a deemed price control situation triggering the surrogacy method of calculating normal values. To this end, the task force has proposed amendments to the government bill. The amendments provide for the making of regulations that would prescribe circumstances in which price control is deemed to exist. Those circumstance include: majority ownership or control by a foreign government in the enterprise manufacturing the exported goods; any government restriction on selling on the domestic market; government owned or controlled enterprises being major domestic customers for the goods sold; and any government restriction or direction as to the quantity of goods to be manufactured.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been pointed out that the United States and the European Union treat China as a command economy, not as an economy in transition, for the purpose of their anti&hyphen;dumping laws. It has been suggested that the proposed legislation takes Australia too far, too soon, towards recognising China's domestic prices as having the characteristics of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> normal values. It has been suggested that the amount of government involvement in the Chinese marketplace is such that it is a mistake to treat all privatised Chinese companies as free market players. In my view, the concerns of industry are valid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask the minister to consider further amending the bill to give more guidance to the Director of Operations of Customs by specifying how to identify a price control situation, ensuring that Customs can identify the existence of government subsidised inputs. I endorse the industry's plea that a price control situation should be treated as it was under the command economy rules&mdash;that is, using a test based on the surrogate country test. That particular test was used successfully in the past and there appears to be no logic in abandoning it in price control situations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In view of the government's legal advice, it appears that an amendment to the Customs Act, to the effect that a price control situation in a transitional economy is to be treated in the same manner as is a centrally planned economy, is what is required. Australian industry must be treated fairly if it is to compete in the global marketplace. Having said that, I am not advocating special protection for our own industries, but that they have an opportunity to compete fairly and equally on their own merits. The purpose of anti-dumping laws is to protect industry from unfair trading. Countervailing duties are not tariffs; they are not a form of artificial protection. They are designed to even out unfairness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, the bill's provisions, as they stand, need to be built on. They should represent a beginning of modernisation of the relevant legislation. The amendments before the parliament today should not be considered as an end in themselves.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously for a country like Australia, which exports a lot of products and is in competition globally, anti-dumping legislation is very important to it, as are imports. In particular, I want to focus my comments on the manufacturing of paper in my electorate of Braddon, a major industry in Australia. The forest industry is very important to Australia and the manufacturing of paper is a very important part of the forest industry. That industry is in competition with many countries&mdash;some have a demand economy; others have an economy in transition. From time to time, there are opportunities for some of these countries to put products onto our market at prices below cost. In recent days, a particular case of dumping has been brought by a particular company against 14 different countries around the world. I want to make a few brief comments about the importance of Australia having good anti&hyphen;dumping legislation. The government will be responding to the Willett report in the near future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A member of the opposition came into this House and made some comments about the anti&hyphen;dumping process. On this issue, the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) can be described only as being a prime example of a hypocrite. He was in government for 13 years. In actual fact, it was his government that brought in the Anti&hyphen;Dumping Authority in 1990.

They say one thing in opposition and do something different in government. That is what is going on with this particular issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a fascinating discussion in the last six months on anti-dumping and the importation of paper into this country. I have been working quite closely with a group in my area, comprising largely of AWU members and people from management in a paper company at Wesley Vale and Burnie. Just recently the CFMEU has jumped onto the bandwagon. Up until August they were not going to have a thing to do with this anti&hyphen;dumping case. They would not join, they would not participate, with the TasPEAC members to fight this case at all, because of the fight between the unions. How ridiculous! There are 1,000 jobs involved in northern Tasmania in these two companies and you have an inter-union dispute&mdash;a fight between them. The Johnny&hyphen;come&hyphen;latelys&mdash;the CFMEU&mdash;now want to get involved in the anti&hyphen;dumping case. They have promoted the idea of bringing in a private member's bill, which has been introduced in the Senate and in the House of Representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is a stunt. We all know it is a stunt. It will go nowhere. It will lie on the table. Every now and then the member for Hotham will refer to it and argue that this is an important advancement. If it were not a stunt, if it were genuinely a policy reform being put forward by the opposition to improve anti&hyphen;dumping procedures in this country, I would have thought that their draft platform would have said something about anti&hyphen;dumping in it. If you go through this draft platform&mdash;I think, it was put out a week ago, so it is right up to date&mdash;there is not one word about anti&hyphen;dumping in it. Yet they come into this place and parade around as if, by bringing in this private member's bill, they are going to do something to help the manufacturing industry in Australia. It should be seen for exactly what it is. The member for Hotham is a person who is mainly full of words and very 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11468"> little action. This has clearly been promoted by an inter-union dispute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was interesting to talk to the AWU people. They said that Senator Cook did not support doing away with the Anti-Dumping Authority. Yet the private member's bill, which has been supported by Senator Shayne Murphy from Tasmania, is doing away with the Anti&hyphen;Dumping Authority. I wondered where their policy position was, so I picked up their draft platform to try to identify where the Labor Party were going on this issue. They are obviously going nowhere. The real problem with this whole issue is that they have been going around fear campaigning&mdash;a bit like the nursing home issue&mdash;trying to stir up trouble. This was also the case with the tariffs issue in my area. Under our government, the Australian Customs Service has been diligently looking into this anti-dumping problem which we are faced with not only in Tasmania but also in other pulp industries around this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Two or three days ago, on 20 November, the Australian Customs Service brought down their report. They found that 90 per cent of the paper coming in 1997 from about nine or 10 different countries out of the 14 was dumped paper. The CFMEU were really annoyed&mdash;the AWU workers in TasPEAC have been working really hard; they have been coming up here, meeting with the government, talking with the minister, lobbying in this parliament for the company and for their jobs, working with me and some other senators and members in this parliament to try to make sure the case goes forward to the Australian Customs Service&mdash;that the report of the Australian Customs Service said that 90 per cent of the product coming in was dumped. They are miffed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the real problem for the member for Hotham. He is miffed because he has lost any substance to his fear campaign. We hope that as this goes on to the Anti-Dumping Authority over the next 90 or so days the authority, under representation and information given to them, will come to a decision which is balanced on scientific facts. We await their decision. At the moment we have this inter&hyphen;union dispute. The Labor Party were hoping 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this would be a great trump card in northern Tasmania. They have failed because the decision from of the Australian Customs Service indicates that dumping is occurring.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important for a country like Australia and its manufacturing base to ensure that there is no dumping. There does need to be fair trading in this whole area. Certainly, in many regional parts of Australia it is absolutely vital that we do protect our manufacturing base from unfair trading which can occur. Australia is a very credible country, a very competitive country, a country that is willing to compete in the global market. We do not want any protection from competition from other countries. We are prepared to market our products on a fair basis. That is what this debate is all about: trying to ensure that products coming in here are not being dumped below the price they are being produced in other countries. It is particularly important at this time for the forest industries and the paper and pulp industries in Australia, if there is any evidence, scientific empirical data, that dumping is occurring, that we act and are firm in our resolution to fight that type of unfair competition coming into this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a great result so far with the anti-dumping case brought by the pulp company in Tasmania. A lot of hard work has gone into that by TasPEAC members and several other senators and members, and I have been representing them. As we continue to make those representations, if the facts stack up, I am quietly confident that we will get a good result in the anti-dumping procedures which we have at present in this country.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The  Customs Tariff (Anti&hyphen;Dumping) Amendment Bill 1997  is a means through which some of the recommendations of the Willett anti-dumping report can be implemented. We on the opposition side will support some of the things in this bill. Without some action, thousands of Australian jobs will be put at risk because of the unfair international trading practices. The Willett report was commissioned by the current government to cut the time taken to investigate complaints of dumping and to improve procedures to ensure Australian producers are not disadvantaged. Some useful and valuable recommendations have emerged from this report. The Willett report recommendations have been with the government over a year and the government has done nothing about it. In fact, the government has faced a number of questions during question time this session and all it has come up with is the change to the time it takes to put forward anti-dumping complaints.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a very vexed issue. Dumping is the practice of selling goods at a price below the home country to the disadvantage of industry of the importing country. We can apply anti-dumping duties if we can prove that the goods have been dumped. In Tasmania, where we produce a lot of paper and a lot of pulp, we have a particular problem with the dumping of paper. At the moment there is a case being investigated with Customs for the Tasmanian Papermills Employee Action Committee, TasPEAC. Many of us have given broad and strong support to TasPEAC's case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The initial findings by the Australian Customs Service that were handed down last week found that 22 of the 31 companies in the 14 importing countries were dumping. Securities have been placed on 14 of them. Australian Paper started action against the 14 countries back in July claiming they were flooding the market with cheap paper. It is through the action of TasPEAC, in particular Royce Webster, that much of this case has come to light. They alerted the people who were involved directly with the mill and made sure that the whole of the north&hyphen;west coast of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Tasmania and the north understood the issue and what it would mean to the Tasmanian economy if this paper continued to be dumped in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had hundreds of letters from small businesses and local enterprises all over the north-west coast asking members to help save jobs and, of course, the local economy. Many groups and individuals have made submissions to the Customs Service to highlight the problems that dumping can have not only in the Tasmanian industry but in the interstate industry as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">TasPEAC told me that allowing the dumping would mean that the production of copy paper at the Australian Paper's Maryvale and Burnie mills would not be able to compete with cheap imports at dumped prices. They also pointed out that the current low world market price for fine paper could mean the closure of Australian industry altogether if dumping were sustained. TasPEAC advised me that in 1993-94 dumping of copy paper caused the loss of 1,000 jobs before the ACS inquiries found overseas producers from a number of countries guilty of causing material injury to the Australian industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now we have another problem that is emanating from Indonesia. They have some of the lowest cost producers of copy paper in the world, but they enjoy huge government patronage and subsidy. They have very negligible environmental costs and/or charges and they have extremely low labour costs. This is supposed to be a level playing field. It is not a level playing field, and we should not kid ourselves that it is. This government should do something about it. It should act quickly. By comparison, Australian paper makers have to meet among the highest environmental standards in the world. This particular Australian company does not enjoy any government patronage. It has no subsidies and, at only five per cent, has among the world's lowest tariffs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have good environmental standards and forest protection in this country. We lead the world in forest practices. We should set standards that also assist to bring some of the rest of the world on-line by lifting the standards in those countries as well. The most 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11470"> recent case certainly highlights the ineffectiveness of this country's anti-dumping laws as evidenced by this incursion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">TasPEAC have told me that they have been particularly concerned over the inadequacies of the investigations overseas. They talked of two-day visits with no interpreters, no mill visits and exporters using former Customs employees and consultants to their own benefit. It is obvious that more resources need to be directed to such investigations so that they can be carried out independently of other countries' interests. It is in the national interests of Australia&mdash;the working people and the battlers of this country and the battlers in the electorate of Braddon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A lot of this could have been avoided if the Willett recommendations had been implemented. All the government has done with this bill is shave 30 days off the existing investigation times without addressing any of the fundamental structural issues highlighted by Willett which require legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have been told that the government will conduct a review of the entire anti-dumping scheme by the Productivity Commission, but so far I have heard nothing of it. There is now enormous uncertainty in the Asian economy, and many countries will be looking to offload their surplus. Australian manufacturers are more exposed than ever. I certainly hope that the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs (Mr Truss), who is at the table, takes this on board in his deliberations between now and Christmas. I certainly hope that he will come up with some recommendations and take them to the cabinet that will put something in place to protect Australian manufacturing jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although this bill does go partly towards dealing with this problem, it only scratches the surface. We on the Labor side of politics believe that anti-dumping measures should be about ensuring fairness in international trade. The primary focus should be on creating Australian jobs and building national wealth. They should not, on the other hand, be used as a protective trade barrier or breach any international trading obligations. Legislation and administrative changes are needed to preserve the integrity of Australia's anti- 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">dumping scheme and restore confidence in the system among manufacturers, primary producers and importers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what Labor tried to do through the private member's bill put up by the shadow minister for industry and regional development, the member for Hotham, Simon Crean. It would have cleaned up some of these problems once and for all. I can understand the frustration of our shadow minister, the member for Hotham. He has tried and tried again to get an answer during question time about where the Willett report is under review and what the time frame is to get something done with the Willett report, but no-one on the government side will give him an answer. So he put forward a private member's bill to try to address this question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I asked a question yesterday in which I referred to the economic downturn among a number of our Asian trading partners and the potential this has to result in a significant increase in dumping from those countries. I asked what the government had done to safeguard Australian manufacturers from unfairly priced markets and imports. I also asked when the recommendations of the Willett anti-dumping report would be implemented. The answer was, `This question was dealt with a couple of weeks ago.' The Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) then passed the buck to the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs, saying that he was handling the Willett report and that parliament should wait until there is a response to the total Willett report. That was it. It was flogged off&mdash;`Don't worry.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can tell you that nothing has been done yet, and we do not know when it will be done. In the meantime, there is a wide, gaping hole by which our industries can be affected by dumping. Talk about fiddling while Rome burns; that is really an understatement in this case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Government has a job to do to protect our industries from unfair trading practices. The Willett recommendations should be taken up. It should not be left to companies or a group of employees to mount a challenge to other countries to prevent the dumping from occurring. It should be part of the Australian 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11471"> regulations to ensure that they can trade on an equal footing. I do not know whether people realise quite how serious this can be for Australian industry. With all the freeing up of marketplaces, there are a lot of new opportunities, but there are also a lot of unscrupulous players out there. If we are to enjoy the ability to trade equally with other nations, we have to make damned sure that our regulations can withstand the onslaught of unfair practices. Australia can be on the losing end of jobs, investment and our quality of life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not see how the member for Braddon can go back to his constituency and say that this government has done everything it could to protect and retain the paper industry. I do not think it has. His contribution today, which made excuses for government inaction, will certainly not satisfy his constituency. The criticism made by TasPEAC that the process is flawed is correct. The fact that the inadequate dumping laws prevent evidence from the 1996 dumping being accepted now is a case in point. Is this going to be addressed by the government or is it going to run away from this too? We would like those answers. The government has a job to do. Why can it not get on and do it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am willing to agree to this bill as it stands, but the government has to address the broader issues contained in the Willett report&mdash;and address them soon&mdash;so that there is some security in Australia against dumping. We really need some security and comfort for Australian workers and battlers.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank honourable members for their contributions to this anti&hyphen;dumping legislation. I have noted the comments that members on both sides have made about the importance of anti&hyphen;dumping measures and having an effective regime in Australia to ensure that Australian industry does not face unfair and improper competition from goods that are dumped or subsidised in their country of manufacture.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say that I have, though, been a little disappointed with what seems to be a lack of understanding on the part of some members opposite as to what dumping actual 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ly is. The fact that something comes into this country that is cheaper than the Australian product does not mean that it is dumped. The fact that it comes here and may be of poorer quality than the Australian product does not mean that it is dumped. The fact that it might be providing competition to an Australian industry does not mean that it is dumped. For a product to be actually dumped in this nation in the context of anti-dumping legislation, it has to be sold in Australia at a lower price than it is sold domestically in its country of manufacture. That point is sometimes missed by some who make perhaps ill-informed comments on these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean) was perhaps as much guilty of that as anyone. I am disappointed that the person who sometimes says he is the shadow minister for these matters would make statements that are inaccurate. My understanding is that the shadow minister for customs is the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin). Opposition policy may well be advantaged if the member for Hotham gave it all away and let the member for Cunningham get on with the job. I think we would end up with a much more rational policy that way. There certainly seems to have been a degree of shifting and changing as far as that is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Hotham made quite a deal of reference to the Monsanto glyphosate case. He suggested that the government had messed it all up and that, therefore, this legislation was to try to fix up the problem. That is an absolute load of nonsense. It is important at the beginning to understand why the decision was made in relation to the glyphosate case. I will read directly from the conclusions of report No. 159 from the Anti-Dumping Authority into glyphosate acid from the People's Republic of China. The Anti&hyphen;Dumping Authority states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Authority has found that most exports of glyphosate acid from China to Australia have been undumped. Of the few shipments that have been dumped, the dumping margins were negligible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Authority is not satisfied that glyphosate acid produced in Australia meets the `local content' requirements of subsection 269T(2) of the Customs Act.  
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11472">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So the Anti-Dumping Authority, firstly, came to the conclusion that the glyphosate was not dumped and, secondly, that even if it was, because the manufacturer in Australia did not meet the 25 per cent test, there was just no capacity for the ADA to make a ruling in its favour, even if it had wanted to do so. So the existing legislation, the legislation put in place by the previous government, precluded a decision being made in Monsanto's favour. I want to make one other observation in relation to that decision. It is true of almost every anti-dumping case that when one industry receives an anti-dumping duty that generally means that the costs go up for other industries. The decision not to impose an anti-dumping duty on glyphosate acid coming in from China was hugely popular in the rural sector, because they were going to get access to lower priced chemical products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While referring to the comments of other members, I will make a brief reference to some of the remarks by the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), who spoke about how important it is that there not be any undue burden on industry in endeavouring to establish what the costs of production might be in a faraway country. Let me emphasise that the government certainly recognises the difficulties faced by local industry, especially small business and smaller industries, in gathering information to mount a successful case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation does not impose a burden on the local industry. All they need to submit is `such information that is reasonably available'. It is then a matter for Customs to do the detailed research that might be necessary to ascertain whether practices are occurring in the country of manufacture which should give rise to dumping duties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to make a couple of comments on the coated paper case that was of particular interest to the last speaker who contributed to this debate, the member for Lyons (Mr Adams), and also to the member for Braddon (Mr Miles), who has done an outstanding job in representing the interests of the people of northern Tasmania and their particular concerns on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was a very difficult case because it involved claims against 14 countries. It seems 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that some members, even though they claim to be very close to the situation in Tasmania, had not caught up with the fact that last week a positive finding was made in relation to Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Republic of Korea, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Taiwan. The exports from the companies subject to a positive finding represent 90 per cent of imports of the goods since January 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a finding in that particular case, and the matter now goes to the Anti&hyphen;Dumping Authority. I encourage anyone who has views on that matter to make sure that they are known to the Anti&hyphen;Dumping Authority. At the completion of its review, the ADA will make recommendations to me as the minister, and I will then decide the issue. It is inappropriate for me to make too many comments about the details of that case until I have had the opportunity to consider the ADA report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the legislation before the House, section 269TAC of the Customs Act provides for the assessment of the normal value of imported goods for the purposes of dumping investigations. Until the latter part of last year, this section was applied to goods exported from economies in transition, such as China, by reference to information obtained in a surrogate country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the key point&mdash;and I hope that even the member for Hotham might be prepared to acknowledge this point. In November of last year, the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department advised that section 269TAC(4) was severely limited in its application. Its stringent tests require that the government of the country of export has at least a substantial monopoly of all of the trade of the country, not just in terms of the trade in the goods under consideration, and must also substantially influence the domestic price of all goods in that country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The advice went on to conclude that the section could have no further application to economies in transition, such as China. As this section can have no further application to economies which are considered to be in transition, the determination of the normal values of exports from such economies as a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11473"> matter of law must be made in accordance with the remaining provisions of section 269TAC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The existing legislation does not distinguish between market economies and those that are considered to be in transition. Normal values of goods exported from economies in transition must therefore be ascertained by the application of the same methods that are required for exports from countries such as the United States of America and Germany. There is presently no flexibility available to treat exports from economies which are in transition differently from exports from other countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australian industry has expressed concern at the potential for dumped imports from economies in transition to adversely affect Australian manufacturers. The government and Australian industry recognise the need to restore flexibility in the investigation of dumping from economies in transition. That is the purpose of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 12 March 1997, the government announced its intention to introduce into parliament amendments to the Customs Act that provide for a case by case approach to be taken in investigations into the alleged dumping of products from economies in transition. The Customs Legislation (Anti&hyphen;Dumping) Amendment Bill 1997  amends section 269TAC of the act, and was tabled before the parliament on 25 June 1997. The bill corrects the anomaly with the existing legislation by recognising that there is still a level of government control evident within economies considered to be in transition which might in some cases so influence the domestic price of the goods under consideration that it would be inappropriate to use that price to determine normal valuation. The legislation has been drafted to provide investigators with a sufficient degree of flexibility to allow them to determine the normal value of goods under investigation in the best available manner, given the circumstances of each case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Specifically, it provides that in those circumstances where the government of the country controls or substantially controls the domestic selling price of the goods in question then the normal value of such goods may 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> be determined, having regard to all relevant information. This information may include, but is not necessarily restricted to, information obtained in a surrogate country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the request of the government, following the tabling of the bill in June, officials convened a series of meetings in Melbourne, Sydney and Canberra to consult with Australian industry on the provisions of the bill. In view of allegations that somehow or other the government has been tardy on this matter, it is important to note the progress that has occurred. The legislation was introduced in June, after the government's announcement in March that it was to take action in this area. That is surely a reasonable time in which to draft the appropriate legislation. We then consulted extensively with industry and held seminars in various places around the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, the Senate, of its own volition, chose to take the matter away for its own inquiry. The government has been criticised on a number of occasions for proceeding with debates before the results of Senate inquiries are known. We have allowed a proper process of consultation to occur and the bill has now been brought on for debate. Industry expressed concern that the bill referred only to government control over the domestic selling price of the goods in question, and so a little later in this debate I will be proposing a government amendment to deal with those kinds of industry concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am conscious of the importance of this legislation and of the keen interest of members in anti&hyphen;dumping measures and the sorts of structures that should be in place to best deliver results and outcomes for Australian industry and the Australian community. As I said before, we are currently actively addressing those issues. This legislation goes a long way to introducing a fair and appropriate way to deal with countries in transition, and I commend it to the House.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">I foreshadowed this amendment in my contribution to the second reading debate, because whilst we acknowledge that the government's amendments that it will move a little later do try to address key issues that we have raised they do not go far enough. In essence, our amendment seeks to establish that, once a price control situation exists, that situation must lead to a surrogacy test. That is the effect of our amendment. The government's amendments, as I understand it, leave a discretion in the various stages of the process and, ultimately, the minister as to whether surrogacy applies. Rather than giving certainty to our manufacturing industry so that when they have established a case they know that surrogacy will apply, the government's propositions seek to compound that uncertainty, because there is no guarantee that the government would act and require the surrogacy test.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A point that we have to acknowledge is that the government has embraced what we have been pushing for in taking account of the input components that go into the final price. It has embraced the 10 per cent test which we have put forward. But, in embracing the test, the government still leaves too much discretion with, ultimately, the minister. Also, before that, with regard to the two stages of process&mdash;the Customs Service and the Anti&hyphen;Dumping Authority&mdash;there is too much discretion as to whether, having established the 10 per cent exercise, surrogacy applied. They could ignore it, the minister could ignore it, or they could surrogate it. Our amendment seeks to give certainty so that, once you establish the test, surrogacy applies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We understand that the legislation that is before us is to patch up a mess of their own making and to try to deal with exercises on a case by case basis. We understand that legislation in some form must be passed to correct this. But what we are saying is that if we are going to give certainty to industry then our amendment is better, because it gives the cer 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="11475"> tainty once you have established that the price fixing arrangements exist. The other thing that we do in our amendment is to enable, through regulations, the positive identification of price control by actually specifying the criteria that would be taken into account. That is the amendment that we are proposing. We urge the government to embrace it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the peanut growers in the electorate of the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs (Mr Truss) will be pretty disappointed by his performance. This was the minister who, in 1992, was the most vocal critic of dumping from China. This was the person who said, `We have got to introduce legislation to act speedily to address those problems.' He campaigned in his constituency about doing something. When it comes to the ultimate test, when he has actually got charge, he wimps it. I think he is going to have some explaining to do in saying to his farmers and to manufacturers around the country that when they can actually demonstrate that price fixing arrangements are existing they still cannot be certain that the surrogacy test will apply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of glyphosate the other day, we saw how the government ignored evidence that was before us that showed that glyphosate prices were being fixed. That is why we believe there should be no discretion. That is why our amendments require surrogacy to apply once the tests are met.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I urge the House to embrace our amendment because it strengthens the bill. If this amendment fails, of course we will support the government's amendments because at least they do improve the situation, but they do not improve it in a way that gives certainty to our manufacturers. Whilst they do not have that certainty, jobs will continue to be lost in this country.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition amendment, as the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean) says, goes very much further than what is proposed by the government. In fact, I believe it goes even further than he acknowledged to the House. The intent behind the government's bill is to provide greater flexibility to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> investigating authorities. When a price control situation is identified, investigating authorities are able to determine normal values by reference to all relevant information, thus maximising flexibility.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, where there are three exporters from an economy in transition and only one is affected by a price control situation, investigating authorities are able to determine normal values for that one exporter by reference to the domestic selling prices or costs of the two other exporters whose sales are not subject to control. There is no automatic reliance upon surrogacy information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment proposed by the member for Hotham limits flexibility. Investigating authorities would be precluded from looking at what other information might happen to be around. In essence, investigating authorities would be compelled in all cases to rely solely upon information obtained in surrogate countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment also requires investigating authorities to proceed beyond an examination of the extent to which the prices of the exporters&mdash;that is, the alleged unfair traders&mdash;are subject to control. The amendment requires investigating authorities to look at `any other seller'. This is obviously one of the significant difficulties the government has with the opposition's amendment. Even if it is established that the particular exporter is trading in response to market forces, investigating authorities must conduct a thorough search of the entire market of the economy in transition to see if there is one seller, who might not even be an exporter, whose prices are subject to government control.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, under the amendment, one seller in the entire Chinese market is sufficient to so take the entire Chinese market as to render it inappropriate to have regard to the Chinese exporters' domestic selling prices as an appropriate basis for the determination of normal values. A Foreign Affairs detailed analysis of the Chinese market has concluded that, although there has been significant economic reform, the sheer size of its domestic market means that it is likely that, if investigating authorities look hard enough, they will find one seller in any given sector 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11476"> which is still subject to control. In essence, the amendment would lead to the reinstatement of pretty well an automatic application of surrogacy information in all future dumping cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are concerned that that will be the practical effect of the proposed amendment. It limits flexibility. If after an exhaustive search the investigating authorities are unable to find one seller in the entire Chinese market whose selling prices are subject to control, the search is not over under this amendment. Again, the phrase `or any other seller' is used. Investigating authorities must again scour the entire market to identify whether one seller is able to buy a significant input at a price which is subject to government control.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Investigating authorities must, therefore, not only identify all sellers of like goods within the Chinese market but also identify all suppliers of significant raw material inputs to such sellers. Our concerns, therefore, are that the opposition amendment goes further than the government is prepared to go in this particular matter and would in fact destroy the capacity to demonstrate flexibility in dealing in economies in transition, which is the primary purpose of the bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take the opportunity while the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs (Mr Truss) is here to reiterate one or two points that I made in my contribution to this anti&hyphen;dumping legislation a little earlier and pick up specifically this issue of flexibility to investigating authorities&mdash;plural. One of the major stumbling blocks which we have experienced, which we have identified and which the private member's bill of the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) picks up is the need to ensure that this `authorities' involvement is limited, is contained within one organisation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The process of the identification of concerns in anti-dumping cases brought to the government's attention was clearly and amply demonstrated by the member for Murray (Mrs Stone) in her contribution a little earlier today when she talked about SPC and Ardmona and the dumping of canned pears and other fruits from Spain, China and one other country. She talked about the process that was followed 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> under existing legislative regimes where the Anti-Dumping Authority and the Australian Customs Service became involved. She talked about the difficulty of sending officers to that foreign country to check the validity of the dumping claim. She talked about reports going to ministers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I pointed out, of course, there have been three ministers since the government came into office last year, and there is no way that that has not added to the confusion. It has gone across you, Minister, and your two predecessors and there has been a difference in emphasis as well, as I pointed out in comparing attitudes to one or two dumping cases which had been outlined in a report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> by David Forman.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This flexibility to investigating authorities is not something which we would want to stifle. In fact, it is the opposite. I think it is what the member for Hotham's amendment is on about. Importantly as well, drawing on his private member's bill which lies in this place, it suggests that there being one investigating authority would make a lot of sense, and I would commend that particular element, as I do the rest of the member for Hotham's private member's bills, to the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister's talking in his response a moment or two ago about people perhaps not having an appropriate understanding of what dumping is all about is real. We are spending a fair bit of time in this country on becoming involved in the Australian&hyphen;made campaign. We did in the course of the last government and, hopefully, we may again in the course of this government. At the moment there is a lot of uncertainty about that as well because a new licensing arrangement with the logo was supposed to be in place by the end of last year and June 1997. Apparently there are some difficulties associated with that, and I think the minister is seeking to address that, because he put a press release out the other day about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is intimately bound up in the dumping issue because consumers want to know that the goods and services they procure in Australia are quality goods and services. I think most Australians are interested in the protection of Australian industry and want to pur 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="11477"> chase Australian goods and services. They want to know that, if they go and buy something on the shelf that says `Made in Australia' or `Product of Australia', that is exactly what it is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You could have a circumstance where a foreign producer of, say, canned pears chooses to dump that into the Australian economy and then the Australian producer raises a concern because it might even have labelling on it that says `Product of Australia' or `Made in Australia', although we would hope that that does not occur. But a case was brought to my attention yesterday when I was talking to one of the ABC programs in Melbourne on this subject. They had an example of a product that had `Made in Australia' on the outside, but when you opened it up it was an Indian product and there was another label on the inside that said that. We should start looking at those sorts of issues, Minister, and I am sure you will take that on board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My point on this specific matter is that, clearly, if there are products being dumped into Australia, it is going to be injurious to Australian manufacturers, it is going to bring jobs into jeopardy in this country and it is something we want to change. We would maintain that flexibility in investigating authorities could be improved by one authority taking that responsibility. But, as is indicated here by the member for Hotham's amendment, we have also applied some other tests which we believe are more reasonable but which you have said are harder. We think this amendment needs consideration, and we are going to support it accordingly. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will just say one further thing because the minister was not here when I made a contribution a little earlier, and it is something the member for Hotham and I have spoken about as early as this morning. That is, the present economic circumstances of some of our major trading partners in the Asian region are such now that we may well see a flood of dumped products coming into Australia. Because there is this need to try to strengthen those economies again, we are going to see, as a result of some of the advances that have been made in the tiger economies of Asia particularly, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> producers trying by necessity to continue to make some foreign currency, and they will do that in any way that is possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There may well be a flood of products coming into Australia. We do not dispute competition. You have said that, Minister, and we have said that as well. But the concern that we would have is that the flood of foreign material, foreign goods, coming into Australia may come in at a disadvantageous price to Australian producers and would be clearly within the ambit of the anti-dumping legislation. Again, for the benefit of the minister as he is with us now while we are talking about this matter, I think it would be well worth while if both the Anti-Dumping Authority and the Australian Customs Service kept a weather eye out for these sorts of things as those Asian economies look to ways in which they can get back on their feet.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will respond briefly to the last matter raised by the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), although, Mr Deputy Speaker, you are being very indulgent to allow us to get this far off the amendment. I have noted comments by a number of people that there is a greater risk of dumping action as a result of problems in Asian economies. The difficulties are generally occurring in economies which would not be affected by this legislation anyhow because they are not regarded as economies in transition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously, there are concerns internationally about these economies, and we as Australians are concerned about what impact any decline in those economies might have in Australia. It does not necessarily follow that because there is a lot of pressure in those economies they would seek to dump products in other parts of the world. In fact, one of the things that is likely to happen is that their own domestic markets will collapse to some extent and, therefore, a product could be sent to Australia or a third country at a lower price without it actually being dumped because, by way of definition, it would not be being sold here at a lower price than at home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those are issues that may well have to be dealt with within other fora other than the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11478"> anti-dumping area. But certainly, if there are examples of cases where dumping occurs, we need to act and we need to have appropriate mechanisms in place to ensure that Australian industry is able to seek protective action and then that we can deliver that as promptly as possible.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Honourable members will be aware from the preceding debate that this legislation has been before the House of Representatives since 25 June. The government undertook extensive consultation with industry. There was a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11480"> Senate committee consideration of the matter and, as a result, the government is proposing a number of amendments. Industry expressed concern that the bill referred only to government control over the domestic selling price of the goods in question and did not address the issue of government control over the price of significant raw material inputs into the manufacturing process of allegedly dumped goods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In September, the Senate referred the  Customs Legislation (Anti&hyphen;Dumping) Amendment Bill 1997  to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, and industry continued those arguments before that committee. The majority report from the committee recommended the passage of the bill but commented that consideration should be given to the cost of raw material inputs where investigators conclude that it exceeds 10 per cent of the production process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important that Australia's anti-dumping system is recognised by both the industry and the international community as providing an effective remedy against discriminatory pricing practices to enable industry to compete on an equal footing. It is not reasonable to expect industry to be able to compete with countries which already enjoy a competitive advantage in terms of cheaper labour and infrastructure costs if their competitors can also procure raw materials at unrealistic state controlled prices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mindful of the views expressed by industry, the government has reached the conclusion that it would be appropriate for the bill to be amended to enable investigators to examine both the domestic selling price of the goods in question and the cost of significant raw material inputs where such inputs are supplied by state owned enterprises. The amendments to the bill will further add to the flexibility needed by investigators when dealing with dumped imports from economies in transition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the amendments which I have moved, where a significant raw material input is supplied by a state owned enterprise, it does not involve in all cases the automatic determination of normal value for the manufactured good solely by reference to surrogate material. The costs of any raw material 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> supplied by non-state owned enterprises&mdash;companies that are genuinely driven by market forces&mdash;would be accepted, and other relevant information would only be used in estimating the cost of significant raw material which is supplied by state owned enterprises. I commend the amendments to the House and present a supplementary explanatory memorandum.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr CREAN</NAME><ELECTORATE> (Hotham)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(1.23 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will not be opposing these amendments. They strengthen the legislation that the government had previously introduced in June. Unfortunately, they do not strengthen it to the extent to which we would have wanted. It is unfortunate that the government has voted down our amendments that would have given the legislation that strengthening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are dealing with here is trying to say to industry, `If you can establish the facts, then you should be entitled to be certain in knowing that the surrogacy test applies.' There is no point in establishing price fixing&mdash;unrealistically fair prices that are controlled&mdash;in the market economy if there cannot be confidence in the government's assessment of dumping, because it then goes off to be tested in the surrogate role as it was done before. Under the discretion that these amendments give the government, the minister can choose to ignore the surrogacy test. That is just not appropriate in circumstances where industry has expended time and effort in trying to establish the case. If people can prove their case, they are entitled to some certainty in the regime that their case, having been proved, will be acted upon. Your amendments do not give them that certainty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for the suggestion that our amendments would have required an endless stream of investigation, that is just not right. What we have consistently said is that, under our amendments, we want specific criteria against which the test of price fixing can be established. Once it is established, there should not be any ifs or buts. You do not use the Chinese price as the test; you go to a real market economy&mdash;not a false market economy. The truth of the matter is that, by this piece of legislation, the government is still enabling 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11481"> China to be treated as a market economy even where evidence shows they are not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, I keep coming back to the glyphosate case, the product that is used in herbicides such as Roundup or Zero. Here there was clear evidence in a document that showed that the price was being fixed in China. The government had it and chose to ignore it. Under our amendments and with that evidence there, the surrogacy test would have had to apply. There is no way the price being put forward by China could have provided the basis for an outcome. Under Labor's test, they would have had to go to the cost of that production in a market economy. That is what our amendments would have achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Your amendments recognise that there could be a problem and want to set up the investigation, but they do not guarantee it. What is the point of telling industry, `It doesn't matter what you prove to us, we still hold the discretion not to act on it,' because that is where you will create the uncertainty. All that business, all the unions and all the workers, whose livelihoods are dependent on these threats of dumped products coming in, are asking for is a regime of certainty&mdash;not endless waffle and not a circumstance in which they can prove the case and still not get satisfaction. That is what we are looking for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite frankly, whilst the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs (Mr Truss) has sought to grapple with this issue&mdash;despite the fact that his predecessors were doing nothing&mdash;he should really be taking a tougher stance on this, given speeches that he has made to this parliament on previous occasions. He was breathing hellfire in this chamber in 1992 and 1993 when he said that Australia was a dumper's paradise. He particularly singled out China and said that tougher action had to be taken, both in terms of the time to run the case and in the outcome, which should go in favour of the local manufacturer. That is what you said, Minister. You said essentially that the onus should be in favour of the Australian manufacturer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What your amendments do is still leave the discretion with you; they do not put the onus 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> or the commitment in favour of the Australian manufacturer. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> I acknowledge that the minister has made some progress on this issue; I acknowledge that we have an improvement in the legislation; and I acknowledge that it is important that this bill is finally brought on for debate. Despite the fact that the bill was introduced in June, we are still only debating it in the second last week of sittings and with no hope of it being passed in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was all very well for the minister to talk about the Senate of its own volition referring this matter to a committee. But you are the ones in charge. You are the government; you can determine the legislative program; you can insist on what goes forward in the program in the other chamber. If you are really serious about this matter, you would have had this bill up in the priorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In any event, if you had brought the legislation back into this chamber earlier&mdash;it has been listed for debate on five separate occasions and then withdrawn&mdash;not only would you have amendments that strengthen the bill being passed here but also you would have been able to get them through the Senate. That is why we are saying that you are letting Australian industry down. We have essentially had to force you into this position but, having forced you into it, we are still going to find ourselves caught with this legislation not concluded, because the parliament is not coming back until March.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even if we pass these amendments today, the fact that the Senate does not deal with them means it does not become law until March or April of next year at the earliest. That is another four months of uncertainty. That is another four months where every product coming in from China is treated as if it comes from a market economy&mdash;no discretion. Because you have opened the gates in terms of glyphosate, they are now floodgates. Everything has to be treated the same way. That is why we are dealing with this amending legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why in goodness name if it is a problem and if you acknowledge it is a problem, won't you seek to move quickly on it? This is the complaint that people have against this 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11482"> government in legion. First, it does not take leadership on these issues; it is always drawn in. Labor has fought the campaign to get this legislation on; you have not done it of your own volition. Secondly, when you are forced into the position, you dither, you waste time. You say, `Yes, we have got the interests of Australian workers and Australian manufacturers at heart.' If you meant it, you would be dealing with this quickly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the problem, Minister. That is the difficulty you have got. You knew as far back as 1992, at least, the problems that confronted this country with dumped product coming in from China. You made impassioned speeches in the parliament. You are now in a position to do something, but you have wimped on it. People do not appreciate their politicians saying something but then not acting on it. They do not appreciate politicians who mouth the words in the electorate but do not back their constituents in the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the problem with the member for Braddon (Mr Miles). That is the problem with him in terms of the textile workers. When we were putting to the test the other customs bill to implement the Willet inquiry, he was down at Burnie saying he is sticking up for the workers in the paper mill. If you are, come and vote for our bill, because our bill supports them. We will put you to the test so that your words will be seen as empty rhetoric down in Burnie. I have been down there, brother, and I know what they think of you. Have a look at the front&hyphen;page Newspoll and have a look at where your government is sliding to. It will be bye&hyphen;bye to you next time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You ought to get smart. You ought to actually stick up for the workers at Burnie. They might give you a few brownie points. But at the moment you are sitting there with a stupid smile on your face. You know you have been embarrassed on this issue. You go down there and say that you have got the interests of their future at heart.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You promised in the election that you would improve the anti-dumping procedures and you have done nothing.

Who is being accused of delaying this issue? The people who sat there for 13 years and did not get around to fixing it are now setting the bar at ever increasingly high places for this government to jump. Frankly, we do not mind big targets because we address them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find with almost some amusement the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) suggesting that the government has not honoured its election commitment. I doubt whether there is any government in history that has made as much progress in developing and implementing its election platform as this one has. With the term only halfway through, most of the platform has been already delivered. What has not been delivered is certainly well on the way to achieving our intended objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I mentioned, the government's progress on this matter has not been slow from the moment the announcement was made by the government that it would address this issue. It is an issue that arose because of advice that came from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department. It was not an attempt to patch up Monsanto. Foreign Affairs and Attorney&hyphen; 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11484"> General's advised that the legislation that you had put in place could no longer be used in relation to economies like China in the way it had been in the past because they could no longer be considered to be command economies. That is a matter of legal advice; it is not a matter of what people say in one place or other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is necessary, therefore, for us to deal with these issues on a case by case basis if we are going to provide an appropriately fair system for looking after the interests of Australian industry. In some cases, there will be a determination that the particular manufacturing process in a country like China&mdash;and let us not forget that there may well be economies other than China affected by this legislation&mdash;is in a command economy environment. In other cases the evidence from Foreign Affairs and others is that that is no longer the case. So that is the objective of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments before the House at the present time enable us to take into account not just the selling price in China but also the cost of inputs where those inputs are significant. I thank the honourable member for Hotham for the faint praise that he gave us in relation to the amendments. I thought he might also be prepared to commend us for the extensive consultation that has been undertaken, our willingness to talk to industry around the country and our preparedness to wait for the Senate committee report and to listen to what they have to say.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should bear in mind that there was a majority report from that committee which recommended the passage of the anti&hyphen;dumping bill and two minority reports which were significantly different from each other. So it was appropriate that the government should consider the content of those reports before bringing to this House amendments which we believe adequately resolve the issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the government's progress on this matter should be commended. I would like to thank the previous ministers who have done all of the elementary and development work on this proposal. It has certainly been my pleasure to bring it before the House today to bring it to fruition. I believe this legislation 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> does provide to industries in Australia an appropriate level of protection where dumping occurs. It also ensures that, where a country like China is making reasonable and commendable steps towards freeing up its economy, we recognise those achievements and give them credit where they have made improvements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we all know that China still has some distance to go. Therefore, it cannot be treated as a completely free and open economy in the current circumstances. That is why this legislation is before the House. I believe it will be welcomed by manufacturers and industry in this country.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am most appreciative that members of the government have provided me with an audience.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is the sixth omnibus taxation bill for 1997. It covers 10 separate issues relating to avoidance schemes, manipulating capital losses, simplifying the tracing rules for company losses, closing of a sales tax loophole on reimported goods, changes to fringe benefits tax, adjusting capital gains tax to take into account some deductible expenses incurred on real property assets, tightening of expense claims for insurance companies and clarifying depreciation rules for previously tax exempt entities&mdash;for example, assets which have been privatised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first area I want to concentrate on relates to those in the area of fringe benefits tax. The bill proposes to exempt certain benefits from fringe benefits tax and to alter the so&hyphen;called arranger provisions. In 1995, Labor reviewed the operation of the fringe benefits tax with a view to simplifying the compliance burden and exempting some benefits where this was considered justified. Some considerable changes were made, including providing an exemption for outside hours taxi travel&mdash;that is to say, between 7 p.m. and 7 a.m., the night hours&mdash;conducted by employees between work and home, and the provision of laptop computers to employees by employers to facilitate work away from the office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These were sensible changes which recognised that there was little or no private benefit by the employer paying for the items as they were really connected with work. In particular, the out of hours taxi travel exemption simply recognised the practice of many employers, including the Commonwealth, of providing taxi travel to their employees who either work late or have to come to work very early. The reason for this benefit being provided is not to provide any kind of rort to employees but merely to recognise that out of hours travel has special features. We know in the first place that public transport services are less available or, in some cases, are not available at all, particularly late at night. It is not fair to tax an employer for providing an 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> employee with what amounts to their only option for getting home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the issue of safety of the employee, particularly late at night, dictates that taxi travel may well be preferable in many situations and that it would be poor social policy for a government to tax such an arrangement. Accordingly, Labor exempted this travel in this context from fringe benefits tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is introducing further changes to exempt all taxi travel from fringe benefits tax. Mr Deputy Speaker, in the view of the opposition, this will be an unlimited right to tax&hyphen;free travel to and from work for those lucky enough to enjoy it. This will mean that directors and executives will be able to negotiate tax&hyphen;free travel by taxi to and from work if they so desire. In practical terms, people working in low income jobs will not benefit from this proposal&mdash;it will be restricted to the better off. Ordinary people will continue to have to pay for their own travel to and from work on bus, train or tram and the like from their own income after they have paid their PAYE tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor believes that this exemption should be opposed on equity grounds&mdash;that is, the exemptions which Labor introduced and which recognise the special circumstances of late night or early morning travel should remain but that no further exemption should be granted. Labor considered this issue in 1995 but rejected it on cost and equity grounds, and we remain convinced that that was the correct decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second proposed exemption relates to certain car parking fringe benefits provided by small business. Quite properly, if an employer provides an employee with subsidised or free use of commercial car parking facilities, for example, in the central business district of Sydney or Melbourne, that is a fringe benefit and is properly liable to fringe benefits tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is fair to say that this has been an unpopular tax measure with some employers, especially when the car parking facility is simply allowing employees to park on the premises. Substantial record keeping is required in some circumstances and it is appropriate to look at the car parking issue in the context of lessening the compliance burden on 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11486"> small business. To address these issues, the bill is proposing to exempt car parking benefits for some employers. The exemption will be limited to those small and medium businesses which are delineated by the tests of not being a public company for the purposes of the income tax law, not being a government body and having less than $10 million per year in gross income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The exemption will be provided only where the benefit is not provided in a commercial car parking facility&mdash;that is, it addresses the perceived anomaly where employers simply make space available for parking, but it will still ensure that high value commercial car parking spaces will be liable for fringe benefits tax. The opposition will support this exemption and the benefits that it provides to the small business sector. It will save a very substantial $35 million for business each year and will eliminate record keeping and compliance costs, which can be substantial in some cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third set of changes proposed to the fringe benefits tax are to change the so&hyphen;called `arranger provisions'. As well as benefits provided by employers to their employees, fringe benefits tax includes, in general terms, a benefit provided to an employee where that benefit is provided by some other party&mdash;a third party, a different party from the employer&mdash;under an arrangement with the employer. They are necessary provisions to ensure that fringe benefits tax cannot simply be avoided by getting people other than the employer, such as clients, to provide benefits on the employer's behalf.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is proposing to alter these so&hyphen;called `arranger provisions' in this bill. The new proposals purport to simplify the rules, but they may actually make more complex and less certain the liabilities of employers in some circumstances. There will now be two ways in which an arranger benefit will arise. It will be provided either under an agreement between the employer and the third party or if the employer is involved in a particular way in the provision of the benefit. So there will now be a test of whether the employer knowingly participates or facilitates the provision of a benefit. In this case, `knowingly' includes 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a situation where the employer ought reasonably to have known about the benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is pretending that this is an improvement on the current situation. This is a matter of some debate. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> carried a report on this issue on 31 October written by Fiona Buffini. A tax partner from Coopers and Lybrand, Mr Chris Blake, is referred to in the article as stating that the changes highlighted the glaring complexity of the fringe benefits tax. It points out that Mr Blake, who is an expert in this area, said that if a third party invited an employee to lunch and the employer did nothing to stop it then fringe benefits tax would apply. If the third party invites the employee directly, there is no tax. But if the third party calls the employer first or invites them and the employee to lunch then under the new rules the employer may have to pay fringe benefits tax on the employee's lunch because the employer may have facilitated the benefit. Mr Blake then goes on to comment that this raises the question of how high up the level of employment has to go before the tax applies. He is quoted in the article as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It's hilarious until you actually have to advise someone.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is a pretty damning commentary on these provisions. An industry expert is saying that the government's legislation is a joke. If this is what the government means by simplifying and improving legislation, then the tax profession has perhaps passed judgment on this particular aspect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor will not be opposing the new regime. I note that it is one thing for rhetoric to be employed by the coalition in opposition in terms of simplifying taxation legislation but, when they actually come to try to implement what they have claimed is so simple, they find that things are rather more complex and difficult in the real world of government. The government is increasingly on the nose in the business community as business finds that the government cannot deliver on the glib promises that it made whilst it was in opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to turn briefly to some of the other measures in the bill. I would indicate at the outset that these are generally of an anti&hyphen; 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11487"> avoidance or base protection nature and, hence, are supported by Labor. The first matter is the denial of artificially created capital losses. The provisions of schedule 1 of the bill will limit the total amount of certain capital losses incurred by corporate groups under the law to the level of the corporate group's actual economic loss. The general anti&hyphen;avoidance provisions of part IVA are also amended to allow these provisions to now apply to schemes artificially creating capital losses in the year in which the capital losses are created.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These amendments will protect around $100 million per year and have the support of Labor. This is further evidence that tax avoidance scheming never stops. There have been many earlier amendments on the capital gains tax provisions to stamp out artificially generated losses, yet clearly further loopholes are always being found and exploited. To paraphrase a famous maxim, `The price of a decent tax system is eternal vigilance.' I can assure the House that the Labor Party will continue to be vigilant in this important area of tax avoidance. Our attempts to stamp out tax avoidance got no support from those opposite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second matter is the concessional tracing rules for company loss provisions. The company loss and debt deduction provisions of the income tax law will be amended by the provisions in schedule 2 to extend to companies two concessional tracing rules available to trusts. These are not actual concessions on amounts of tax payable but, rather, are simpler rules for tracing the underlying ownership of entities where such information is relevant. These simpler rules should lower the cost of compliance with the law and are supported by the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third item concerns the temporary importation of goods. These provisions close a small loophole in the sales tax law whereby goods imported into Australia under a temporary importation exemption, used in Australia and then exported and reimported are not subject to sales tax. This bill imposes sales tax at the time of the reimportation and revenue is only around $2 million per annum. The problem is clearly not a major one from 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the revenue point of view. However, experience shows that small leaks in the tax base do tend to increase significantly over time and that it is worth the effort to close off avoidance avenues when these are identified.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. He refers to a letter written some six months ago. He then refers to advice from my office apparently to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>  last night, and I have no reason disavow him of that advice because in fact Wik was a judgment on leasehold, not freehold, and in terms of that I have no particular complaint. I take this opportunity to say that the issue of freehold is back on the agenda not because of any letter written six months ago but because of Labor's amendments to our Wik legislation. The House is entitled to an explanation in relation to that statement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, the High Court has not ruled specifically on freehold. It has passed comment by way of an obiter dicta, not an actual judgment, which said that freehold and leasehold, properly issued, extinguish native title. We agree; that was in Mabo 2. I agree with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition with that statement inter alia that freehold and leasehold, properly issued, extinguish native title. What then happened? Secondly, the High Court returned to this issue in a specific judgment which, in effect, overturned one half of that statement. It said that, in respect of leasehold there will now be the concept of coexistence. Leasehold no longer completely extinguishes native title. That is an absolute statement in respect of the Wik judgment which then went on to give a postscript&mdash;I freely acknowledge&mdash;which said that, where there was conflict between pastoral leasehold entitlements and native title, the rights of the pastoral leaseholder will in fact prevail.</PARA>

What our legislation seeks to do, and why there is a rising passion with regard to our legislation, is that we seek to fully protect freehold as an effective title in relation to which native title is extinguished. What we found late last night is that the official circulated list of Labor amendments seeks to strike out this protection of freehold which we are seeking to provide. This is the nub of the matter.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Fisher for his question. A meeting of finance secretaries and central bank officials took place in Manila on 19 and 20 November to discuss financial instability in the South&hyphen;East and North Asian region. At that meeting it was resolved that a new mechanism be established for regional surveillance and for dialogue and information exchange between the ministries and banks concerned, with support from the IMF, World Bank and Asian Development Bank. It was agreed that a cooperative regional financing arrangement be developed where participants would provide, in consultation with the International Monetary Fund, supplementary financing on a case by case basis for IMF supported programs. It was also resolved that the IMF examine the possible establishment of a new mechanism to provide short&hyphen;term

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On Monday and Tuesday of next week a meeting of ASEAN finance ministers and six other countries&mdash;including China, Hong Kong, Australia, South Korea and the United States&mdash;will be meeting together to consider the work of the deputies and to endorse these proposals. In addition to that, members of the House will be interested to learn that at the APEC leaders forum in Vancouver it was suggested that early next year there be a meeting between APEC finance ministers and European finance ministers to discuss developments and ways in which initiatives could be developed to deal with the currency instability in the region. Australia has been actively involved in all of these regional initiatives. We have contributed to an IMF&hyphen;led package in relation to Thailand, we have announced our availability for second&hyphen;tier financing in relation to Indonesia, and there will be discussions between all of the finance ministers concerned at meetings starting early next week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said before, a downturn in the South&hyphen;East or North Asian region affects Australia. It affects our exports and it affects our jobs. It is not only in the interests of the region but it is in the interests of Australia to see financial stability return to the region and economic growth strengthened.

The developments which are occurring in Asia are as much financial regulation problems as they are general economic problems, and considerable adjustment will be required in relation to financial supervision to get those countries

How does this situation sit with the government's promise to reduce the administrative burden on small business?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government has introduced some important reforms to the superannuation system to provide for a fairer system in the level of taxes that people pay. The fact is that the system that we inherited from the previous government provided a very significant tax advantage for people on high incomes. And that was not a fair system. We also inherited a $10 billion deficit that needed to be addressed. I will tell you why it needed to be addressed. If the government was not able to get its house and its finances in order, we would not have seen the fantastic reductions in interest rates providing real benefits to the people that you refer to. Some people have short memories, but not on this side of the House. Go back to the late 1980s and the early 1990s and you will find small business paying 15, 18, 20, 21, 22 and 23 per cent interest rates when Labor was in government. When we went to the 1996 election, one of the strongest claims upon us as the incoming government was to get this nation's finances back in order to finally give some real assistance to the small business community.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Swan for his question. This government is determined to address effectively the tragic legacy of unemployment left by the Labor Party. We are doing that of course by bringing through increasing numbers of real jobs. The government is also determined to address effectively the quality of assistance to unemployed people. Next Monday, 1 December marks the beginning of the government's overhaul of the way that unemployed people are helped into jobs. I can announce that from next Monday $16.2 million of Commonwealth funds will be available to 300 private and community agencies to find jobs for 65,000 unemployed people between 1 December this year and May next year. This is the first time ever that federal government funds have been provided to private agencies to place unemployed people in jobs. These 300 agencies&mdash;or probably somewhat over 300 agencies&mdash;will be in direct competition with the Commonwealth Employment Service in the provision of job placement services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This reform will help to place more unemployed people into jobs. It will do that be 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="11493"> cause, first, these agencies will have access to many more job vacancies than the CES. The CES has access to only some 20 per cent of job vacancies, and of course it is trying to place the bulk of unemployed people using its services into that 20 per cent of vacancies. So the first thing the government is doing is expanding significantly the number of vacancies that will be available for unemployed people. Secondly, the job placement services will be using the expertise of people throughout the private and the community sector in these agencies to provide this job placement service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Assistance, for the first time, will be tailored to the needs of the unemployed person, because a very significant feature of the reforms the government is putting in place is the moving away from the rigid program structure that was so characteristic of the Working Nation programs of the Labor Party. Instead of unemployed people being placed, and in many cases forced, into these programs whether or not there was a job at the end, for the first time agencies will be paid when they place someone in a job and the assistance that they provide will be assistance that is best tailored to meet the job needs of the individual person. So we are seeing a very significant improvement in the job placement services that will be available to unemployed people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From 1 May next year, the CES network as a whole will be replaced with improved services for unemployed people by contracting out the $1.7 billion that would flow through the CES over the 19 months following that time if the Labor Party had been in power. Those services will be contracted out to community and private job placement agencies that will be paid not for program placements but for getting people into jobs. This puts to an end Working Nation. It drives the nail finally into the coffin of Working Nation and its inefficient, demoralising, expensive job placement programs which failed utterly to provide the sort of support that unemployed people need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Leader of the Opposition knows this because on Perth radio earlier this year he admitted, `It is true that out of a lot of train 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ing programs people didn't get a job at the end of them.' But that has not stopped the Labor Party in their new draft platform bringing back these labour market programs that failed, reviving the $10 billion failed Working Nation program. They have run completely out of ideas about how to help unemployed people into jobs. The government recognises that there is a huge equity issue to be tackled here. We are putting into place the equity programs that will give unemployed people the chance they never had to get a job under the Labor Party.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

These are the official figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. You can count the number of industrial disputes by either the number of disputes or the number of working days lost per thousand employees. I have got both lots of statistics for you.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Treasurer. It follows the answers he gave earlier both on investment expectations and the Asian economic situation. In the light of the deterioration in Asian economies which has now extended to North Asia, which President Clinton, among others, has described as a threat to the rate of world economic growth, what is the Treasurer's current estimate of the extent of the negative impact of all this on Australian growth and jobs next year? Is it realistic for investment expectations to be maintained at the level they may have been when tested just before the crisis extended to North Asia? Is it realistic to hope, if this was ever the case, for four per cent growth in 1998? Do you now expect lower growth than you forecast in the budget?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for Hotham interjects and he reminds me of a cocky in a pet shop. Cocky want a cracker! Just transport, he says every time. The question was in relation to growth. As I have said on a number of occasions, obviously there will be a downturn in South-East Asia and indeed in North Asia in relation to the currency and financial crises. That will affect Australian exports. Exports are part of the Australian economy and that will have an effect on Australia. To attempt to quantify it would be misleading at best because nobody knows the full extent of the fallout on Asia or the full extent of the fallout on Australia. You would not make assessment until you were aware of the full fallout in relation to that. I have said that on a number of occasions and the position is always the same. What would be the point of making such an estimate? We will make an estimate of growth in the Australian economy at the time of next year's budget. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> That is the time at which we do it and that is the time that we will put it out. I cannot see any significance in doing otherwise now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we can say in relation to the Australian economy is that, if you want an indicator as to where the Australian economy is, you will get the best indicator in the national accounts which will be released next week. Over the course of the last two quarters of this year we have had growth of about one per cent which is consistent with an economy growing between three per cent and four per cent&mdash;probably closer to four per cent than three per cent. As I have said before, that is very strong by world standards.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point I would like to pick up in the Deputy Leader of the Opposition's question was that somehow we should not trust the investment expectations because they were taken before the full brunt of the Asian economy fallout.

I was coming precisely to the question that I was asked by the honourable member for Holt which was that, because the investment expectations were taken at a time of instability in Asia, we could not believe them or we could not believe them fully. They were the investment intentions which were taken at the time of the survey. They were taken at the time when the fallout was very clear in South-East Asia. Mr Speaker, I think all Australians, with the possible exception of the Australian Labor Party, would say, `Wasn't it a good thing that Australian firms, knowing what they did, still had strong investment intentions.' Why would anybody go around as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition did and say, `Well, look, don't think that there are good investment intentions because if you timed it differently we could have actually had a bad result,' and a bad result would be a good result for the Australian Labor Party. I just do not understand the negativism and the anti-Australianness of this negative way in which the Australian Labor Party is now operating.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for McPherson for his question. I have seen a document which purports to be the ALP platform for Australia's armed forces, which no doubt was authorised by the member for Brisbane. I expected to find some substance and ideas in that document. Labor's master plan for capability, as he describes it&mdash;that is, the structure, the equipment, the readiness, the sustainability of the Army, the Navy and the Air Force, the planning and the resourcing framework which underpins all of those things&mdash;amounted to 11&half; lines. Even the member for Reid, who is the newly appointed shadow minister for defence science and personnel, managed to get 70 lines in the 17 paragraphs that he put forward.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is extremely disappointing because when you initiate something like Army into the 21st Century and the defence reform program you would expect to see a platform that had some substance. Those three scant paragraphs that the member put forward are nothing different from Labor's record in the past, which resulted in hollow hulls and empty platforms. As I have said before, and people have recognised in the past, the policy of fitted for but not with. I have often thought the member for Brisbane was similarly fitted. The difference is that if we spend enough money we can fix the hulls but nothing can be done for the member for Brisbane.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should not be too surprised. After all, this policy is a platform from the party whose

<PARA STYLE="Para">I am pleased to report to the House that the meeting in Cairns between 19 and 24 November between the parties involved in the tragic Bougainville conflict was a meeting which made important progress in advancing the current peace efforts. I myself went to Cairns on 19 and 20 November and had the opportunity to discuss the matter with many of the participants there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian government is very happy to be able to play a role in facilitating the peace process. In the case of the Cairns talks, we obviously provided the venue and we made the travel arrangements for around 50 delegates who attended.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the conclusion of the meeting, the parties issued what is known as the Cairns commitment on the implementation of the agreement concerning the neutral regional truce monitoring group for Bougainville. This commitment, which was endorsed by all parties to the peace process, declares the bodies and groups represented will ensure that the truce monitoring group is safe at all times from attack, interference and hindrance. I know members on this side of the House would be very interested to hear that particular commitment because it is important to the Australians. Above all, from our perspective as Australians, it is important to the Australians participating in that truce monitoring group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The commitment also made it clear that the parties will provide all possible assistance to the truce monitoring group in performance of their mandate and urge all other bodies, groups and persons under the authority to do the same. So the Cairns meeting was a very important stepping stone in what is, frankly, a delicate process and what is likely to be a long running peace process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will just make the point that it does disappoint me that the Australian Labor Party treats the Bougainville peace process with such disdain. I know that the current spokesman&mdash;he will not be the spokesman for long, I imagine&mdash;regards the previous foreign minister as a man who suffered from `foreign policy fatigue', and he was happy to say so publicly. But I would have thought that the Labor Party would be interested in the efforts of many Australians to promote the Bougain 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="11500"> ville peace process, including this government, and would regard it as a serious matter. Clearly, you are a party that does not take public policy issues seriously at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last point the honourable member raised in his question was to ask whether events in Papua New Guinea have any implications for the peace process. Can I just say that I have seen reports of allegations made against the Papua New Guinea Prime Minister, Mr Skate. Can I make it clear that from the perspective of the Australian government this is, of course, a matter for Papua New Guinea&mdash;the Papua New Guinea government, the Papua New Guinea parliament and the people of Papua New Guinea. It is not appropriate for the Australian government to comment on those things. Papua New Guinea is an independent country making its own way in the world. Those allegations will have no implications for the Australian government's strong commitment to the current Bougainville peace process or assist with the drought relief effort in Papua New Guinea.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Indi for his question. It seems the opposition, and in particular the shadow Attorney-General, Senator Bolkus, have a failing memory. The senator left the member for Banks out on a limb, telling him to oppose the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R382">Judiciary Amendment Bill</XREF> . One wonders what support was given by caucus to that opposition and whether the Leader of the Opposition knew or approved of that opposi 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="11501"> tion, and one wonders whether the legal committee knew anything about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The decision to oppose such a sensible bill is made quite remarkable when you think of what it actually builds upon. It builds upon significant decisions taken by two of my recent predecessors, Michael Lavarch and Michael Duffy. What Senator Bolkus is doing is hampering the reform process that the Labor Party actually put in train. Senator Bolkus wants to prevent the Australian Government Solicitor from taking full advantage of opportunities in the government legal services market. In doing so, whether he knows it or not, he is placing at risk the ability of the AGS to compete with private law firms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will mean that the Australian Government Solicitor, the government's own law firm, is placed in the best position to compete effectively in that market. It also means that consumers of legal services will benefit from competition through lower costs and more efficiency. Michael Duffy and Michael Lavarch opened up significant non-policy legal services to competition, but it seems that Senator Bolkus does not know that, or at least did not tell his caucus. Michael Duffy and Michael Lavarch knew that if departments had to pay for their legal services out of their own funds, they would be more prudent and more selective in seeking that advice. Michael Lavarch, in a press release in 1994, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Charging for legal services had a significant impact on use by departments and agencies. Introducing competition for the supply of government legal services is an important part of the reform agenda for the legal profession as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">One might ask how the opposition position on this bill fits in with the new Labor platform, which is headed `Community security and access to justice'. It says that the Labor Party has a policy to abolish anti-competitive practices engaged in by the legal profession. Its opposition to that bill entirely opposes and ignores that policy. I wonder whether Senator Bolkus told caucus about that point. We have a backflip on the previous government's policy and a bellyflop on its new policy.</PARA>

Mr Speaker, they are not all against tax reform. I wanted to tell you about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">International work on the tax system has actually shown that multi&hyphen;stage tax is better than single&hyphen;stage tax because it is much harder to avoid, and value added taxes are better because they are much simpler. They allow everybody throughout the chain of production to actually claim an input credit. The difficulty with our wholesale sales tax system is that there are so many exemptions and so many users, you have to collect numbers, you have classification problems, you have different rates, and it increases complexity for small business. One of the things about single&hyphen;rate multi&hyphen;stage tax is that not only is it simpler for business, but they get inputs on all of their taxes and taxes do not cascade through the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Any party of goodwill that wanted to help our exporters would also want to rebate input taxes for exporters. At the moment, around the world, Australian exporters are putting their goods onto the world stage with taxes built into their price. Everybody else around the world is taking those taxes out and allowing their exporters the opportunity to compete on international markets.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a government without leadership, a government without purpose. It is a government with no idea as to where it is taking Australia. This is especially true in the area of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> higher education policy. All that our great national institutions, our 36 public universities around Australia, have received from this government is funding cuts and policy drift. The truth of the matter is that in the first coalition budget in August 1996 they abolished $840 million of growth funding for Australia's universities and with that funding cut 21,000 university places: 21,000 university places were cut under this government's funding policies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is always interesting to hear from the spin doctor opposite, the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Dr Kemp), so labelled by his Victorian colleagues. He is not referred to with any amount of respect; he is just dismissed as the spin doctor who is always trying to put a false interpretation on these figures. It is always interesting to hear from Minister Kemp his interpretation that these massive funding cuts actually represent growth in the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say that, for all her many other faults, at least Senator Vanstone had a bit more honesty when it came to this question. The interesting thing about Senator Vanstone is that whenever she was in trouble over the question of her unpopularity, the fact that she could not visit Australian universities or the fact that academics, students and parents across the board were dissatisfied with this government's policies, she would simply say, `Well, we've made the largest funding cuts for universities.' Her department had to take the largest share of the government's so&hyphen;called fiscal consolidation program. This is what she told <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meet the Press</EMPHASIS> on 2 February this year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The general premise is that when you have gone in and made very substantial changes and made very substantial savings there is obviously not much more to get.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was Senator Vanstone's piece of honesty: very substantial changes, very substantial savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a reflection on this government's poor priorities for education policy that, in relation to the $120 billion envelope of Commonwealth funding, they would decide to make education and training the No. 1 target for their funding cuts. The reality with the coalition budgets is that education and training is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11509"> the No. 1 target for funding cuts while at the same time other large areas of Commonwealth expenditure are quarantined totally from the funding scalpel. Senator Vanstone at least had the honesty&mdash;the honesty this minister has not got&mdash;to own up to the fact that there were very substantial savings. The No. 1 priority for funding cuts was found in the education and training portfolio. As a consequence, the minister has no substance whatsoever.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These funding cuts are having an horrendous impact on universities around Australia. As I travel around the universities I hear of courses being abolished and academics being faced with redundancies. A whole campus&mdash;the St George Campus of the University of New South Wales&mdash;is being closed down. It is a tragedy for Australia that the University of New South Wales is to lose 1,900 student places and $14.4 million from its budget. This is a story that is being repeated at university after university.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The greater tragedy is what it is doing to the aspirations of young Australians, the aspirations of those young Australians who want to work and study hard at school and take their very best opportunity in life&mdash;a university education.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The minister is at it again. The figures are in free fall; he is saying they are up. It is the Orwellian approach of saying that the biggest saving cuts in the budget in fact equal growth. It is the work of a spin doctor&mdash;so labelled by his own Victorian colleagues&mdash;a spin doctor through and through, to adopt the Orwellian approach of somehow thinking that the figures have gone up when

In New South Wales and the ACT: a fall in applications for 1998 of 8.7 per cent&mdash;a large drop from applications for 1997. In your own state of Victoria there has been a fall of 2.5 per cent. Queensland is four per cent down in applications, South Australia is 1.3 per cent and Western Australia is 2.6 per cent down. What sort of minister could sit there undisturbed about those figures?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Out of this terrible situation for universities and the aspirations of young Australians the government tried to throw one sop to the university sector. It was to be called the West report. Their one idea in policy formulation was to establish a committee. This government of flip&hyphen;flops and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11510"> policy reversals in this instance decided to set up a committee. Again, to quote the words of Senator Vanstone, it was not going to be a committee that was of little consequence. This is what she had to say in announcing its terms of reference in January this year:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The panel the government has chosen will be well equipped to carry out a review that will have far&hyphen;reaching consequences for Australian universities over the next two decades.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Far&hyphen;reaching consequences over the next two decades? The truth is that it did not last two minutes. The report was jettisoned by this minister here with a press release late at night before the release of the West discussion paper. It did not get two minutes of public consideration. And under this minister's manipulation of due process it might not even get to a final report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So all those supporters of the university sector in Australia who are looking for a bit of guidance, a bit of direction on policy issues, face a minister now who took the document to cabinet in unusual circumstances and selectively leaked to the media the fact that he is not planning to commission a final report from the West committee. That is an absolute outrage for all those people who troubled themselves to make a submission and who took this government at face value when it said that this would be a report with far&hyphen;reaching consequences over the next two decades. The truth is that the West committee has long gone west under this minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is something that is just typical of the way in which the minister has conducted himself. He is only interested in funding cuts and cheap publicity. He is only interested in two things in the discharge of his responsibilities: funding cuts and cheap publicity. His decision to jettison, to undermine, the West committee has either wasted $2 million of taxpayers' money or the minister cannot be believed in his press release when he claims that he does not support vouchers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One thing I will say about Minister Kemp is that we would give him credit for the virtue of consistency. For 30 years, either advising politicians or being one, he has not changed his mind on one single issue. And the minister nods. So why would anyone think for 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a moment that he is now opposed to vouchers? Why would anyone see the minister nodding about his narrow ideology and his rigid adherence to policy when he puts out a press release saying that he does not support vouchers? This is the man with the passionate gleam in his eye, with the ideological obsession, who strode around Australian universities in 1993 loyally carrying his copy of Fightback, the last man standing with a copy of Fightback under his arm in 1993. He took the boos, the jeers, the tomatoes of Australian university students while saying that if he stood for one thing it was going to be vouchers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, it is a bit rich&mdash;I know you like putting the spin on, being the spin doctor on every single interpretation&mdash;and we all know it, for you to be saying that you do not support vouchers. It is a like your saying you do not support labour market deregulation; you do not support the free market. You have not changed your mind on a single issue for 30 years. Every single Australian student and supporter of universities knows that, if the coalition were to be re&hyphen;elected, as sure as night follows day you would be introducing those university vouchers. It really is rich indeed&mdash;like Dracula saying that he no longer supports the Red Cross&mdash;for Minister Kemp to be saying that he no longer supports vouchers for universities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The one thing about university policy is that it exposes the wide gap in ideology and attitude when it comes to education. It is certainly true&mdash;and people say this as I move throughout the university sector&mdash;that in aspects of policy the gap between Labor and the coalition in the past decade narrowed in some areas. But the policy gap in education is large and growing, because we are not a political party which would ever make education and training the number one target for budget cuts. We are a party which believes in the public purpose of education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition engages in this narrow debate about whether education should be treated as a private or a public good. Their conclusion is that you should attach a user charge and an up&hyphen;front fee to every single aspect of private benefit out of education. The ALP has a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11511"> totally different approach. When we hear the term `user pays' in education our assumption is that society is the user and the beneficiary of education and, as a consequence, it should be the funder of universal education access through the work of the Commonwealth and its revenue raising powers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At a time when education has become so important, the ultimate expression of national sovereignty in a world of economic globalisation, knowledge as an economic input has grown in significance. The overall importance now of lifelong learning, the fact that good citizenship needs to be based on a sound education in an information rich society&mdash;all these things bring education and training even higher on the Labor agenda. An even greater priority will be given under the next Labor government to the significance of education and training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I use an outdated term that somehow got a bit of use in the parliament earlier this week: socialisation. If we want to do one thing, it is to socialise knowledge, to socialise the public access to knowledge. It is the belief that in a fair and decent society every single citizen needs to access information and knowledge, the power of lifelong learning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those people on the other side who want to attach to our side some adherence to socialisation, I proudly say: let us socialise knowledge; let us socialise the public access to lifelong learning. Under a Labor government there could be nothing more important for the fairness and the decency of our society than that commitment. It means regrowing post&hyphen;secondary access in Australia. It means the inevitability of the Commonwealth taking even greater responsibility for all the post&hyphen;secondary functions in education, in TAFE, in vocational education, in universities, in adult and community education, and in Third Age institutions. It means abolishing the up&hyphen;front fees that this minister is supporting and is prepared to extend. We should not have in Australia, in a fair society, one rule of access for the rich and another rule of university access for the poor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say that if students work hard, study hard, and display all the virtues of intelligence and hard work through their school days, they 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> deserve one set of rules for university access, on the basis of merit&mdash;not on the basis of having $100,000 spare in the bank, but on the basis of merit. In terms of the spin doctoring and the fantasy, he was even here in the House earlier on this week saying, `Oh, this could cost 90,000 places.' Do a bit of mathematics: there are eight universities in Australia that are levying the up&hyphen;front fees. If you say they are going to collect 90,000 places, you are talking about 11,000 places at each university. An average university in Australia has 20,000 places. This minister, so deluded and so in a state of fantasy, has the belief in his head that some time in February next year these universities will be accommodating an additional 11,000 students each. Minister, it is just not going to happen. You are in a constant state of delusion and fantasy about the impact of your policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party will further broaden access by returning HECS to a moderate repayment scheme, instead of this punitive scheme that is driving away a generation of young Australians from taking on their best opportunity in life through a university education. The Labor Party will simplify and strengthen the Austudy scheme, which this government has systematically butchered to the point now where the Commonwealth Ombudsman has said that you need a PhD to understand Austudy. A law that cannot be understood is a bad law, and a funding system which cannot be understood by a single student in Australia is a bad system&mdash;butchered and manipulated by this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The further initiative of the ALP in building the virtues of universal access for education&mdash;the power of lifelong learning&mdash;is to take on something the minister never talks about, the need for Australia to be competitive in its university sector, to face up to the fact that learning is becoming internationalised. As you cut the funding, as you cut the places, as you run down the status of academics around Australia, you diminish our capacity to face up to that international competition in higher education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a government which believes in little, a government which may have a significant majority in the House but has only a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11512"> small mandate and a small set of ideas for change. Their only concept in higher education is funding cuts, narrowing access and policy drift.

In its university policies it was a party which discriminated relentlessly against Australian students in favour of students from overseas. It forced tens of thousands of qualified students to stay out of universities, although they wanted to gain entry, while at the same time admitting overseas students.

He is criticising the government, as the Labor Party so often does, for not keeping the Labor Party's promises about the future&mdash;promises that were unkeepable because of the $10 billion hole that the Labor Party left the Australian people and which this government has responsibly dealt with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has pursued policies which are changing the mix of funding between public and private for Australia's universities with the objective of opening up places in universities and expanding the resources available to Australia's universities so they can provide an  internationally competitive education. In 1997, there are 17,000 more undergraduate places in Australian universities than there were in 1996. The number of HECS liable undergraduate places will increase each year to the year 2000. Over 368,000 undergraduate places will be available in Australia's universities by that year, compared with less than 353,000 in 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From 1998, next year, the government will pay the universities, for the first time, for students who are over&hyphen;enrolled above their target numbers. The universities will receive the minimum differential HECS for those over&hyphen;enrolled students. For the first time, there will be payment for those additional places to encourage the universities to admit those students. The Labor Party did not pay a cent for those places, and that is one of the reasons the number of students in Australian universities will be increasing over the next few years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sorry the member for Werriwa was not here to listen to some of these key facts, and I will just repeat them for his benefit. This year there will be 17,000 more undergraduates than there were last year. In every year between now and the year 2000, there will be more government funded undergraduate places in Australian universities and more government funding than there were in the last year of the Labor government. This year it is expanding. From now to the end of the century, this government will be funding Australian universities at a higher level than the Labor Party funded them in its last year 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of office, and there will be thousands more places in Australian universities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Werriwa may not want to face up to these uncomfortable facts, but they are the realities. He is still enmired and enmeshed in the empty rhetoric that accompanied the efficiency savings in this government's first budget. He still cannot get past those unkeepable promises that the Labor Party put forward in its forward estimates because it left a $10 billion hole which someone, whichever government was in power, would have had to address. It is sheer fantasy for the member for Werriwa to suggest that those moneys would have been left there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are doing is freeing up the universities so total university resources can increase.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will be very happy to fight the next election on the basis of those policies that the Labor Party has put forward&mdash;policies which are discriminatory, unfair, inequitable and will reduce the number of places in Australian universities available to Australian students. They will restrict the number of places. Why is the Labor Party planning to go to the next election with the policy of cutting the number of places in Australian universities? Over and above the HECS funded places, which are increasing and which will increase further beyond next year&mdash;there will be 13,000 additional HECS funded places in Australian universities between 1998 and the year 2000; so the government is increasing places&mdash;Australian students, having had that discrimination removed, will be able to invest in their own education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The universities can offer up to 25 per cent of the government funded places in their courses to those students. That could lead to a very substantial increase in the number of places. I certainly do not believe that we will see an increase up to the figure of 90,000 that I used, which is based on 25 per cent of the 360,000 undergraduates in Australian universities&mdash;a conservative figure of what is permissible under the government's policy&mdash;but we will see Australian students coming into Australian universities on those terms and expanding the number of places.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is, of course, also offering extra help for disadvantaged Australian students. There will be 4,000 merit based equity scholarship students in Australian universities by the year 2000. I point out that the University of Western Sydney, which is, I know, attended by many young people from the seat of Werriwa, is in 1997 getting more of these places than any other university in New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is now much more opportunity for students to get a quality education in Australia's universities. Not only has the govern 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment provided an additional $90 million for research infrastructure, an additional $9.3 million for Australian postgraduate awards and an additional $30 million for collaborative research in a strategic partnerships program with industry but also it has given the universities the opportunity to increase the resources that are available to them. They are better resourced today than they have ever been before in Australia's history and they will be better resourced tomorrow than they are today and than they have ever been before as a result of this government's policy. Our policies are throwing open the doors to opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the most important things is that the quality of teaching in the universities should continue to be raised to make sure that Australian students get the best education in the world. The government has instituted the Australian Awards for University Teaching to encourage teaching excellence. The first awards were handed out in the Great Hall of Parliament House earlier this week. I can tell you that the effect of those awards, the inspiration that they give to university teachers, is really quite outstanding. It complements the government's initiative in establishing the Committee for University Teaching and Development to facilitate further practical improvements in university teaching.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, the higher education equity program helps disadvantaged students admitted to university. There is a need to increase opportunities for all young Australians in those post school years. There are very large numbers of students now coming into the traineeship and apprenticeship system. The numbers of young people in traineeships was up some 44 per cent last year over the previous year.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3J4">Mr SAWFORD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will challenge you in a moment. He had a politician exactly like the minister in mind. Fifty years ago Orwell argued that some politicians debased and manipulated language to such a degree that it was against the will of the people. He often referred to the British statement of `the pacification of India' and a Stalinist statement of `elimination of undesirable elements'. In reality, of course, we all learned that they meant something completely different.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Orwell would be equally contemptible of the terms used these days such as `ethnic cleansing', `death by friendly fire' and what we have known in this house as `Kempspeak'. If I remember the essay correctly, Orwell argued that the use of meaningless language was nothing more than a strategy to escape accountability for vile action, to put unacceptable policy into a more positive light and to freeze out any rational debate on that particular issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has learned well the techniques Orwell spoke about so eloquently 50 years ago. The minister is not, as Stalin did, actually murdering people, but he is placing a deathly gloom over education in this country. He is denying opportunities for young people in higher education, particularly those who come from working&hyphen;class and lower middle&hyphen;class families. He is discouraging public investment in human capital resources for the next generation of young Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unlike the Asian tigers who have quarantined public expenditure cuts from the universities from the vagaries of the market, this minister applies the market blowtorch to all that he touches in education and training. He gained enormous publicity from his dishonest revelations about literacy levels in this country. His exposition on literacy levels was selective, dishonest and downright wrong in its assumptions. The actual average literacy 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> levels have not changed a great deal in the last 20 years. What has changed is that the top 20 per cent have streaked way ahead of the average while the bottom 20 per cent have been virtually abandoned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this minister refuses to acknowledge is the resource implications of an increasing number of exiting primary school students who have been subjected to cuts by, largely, state governments for the past 20 years. He stonewalls resource implications. He promotes testing. He blames the teachers. He really just exacerbates the literacy problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, in higher educational matters, he has become the minister for `expenditure cuts lead to opportunities', `loss is gain', `decrease is increase' and `less is more'. No wonder the science and mathematics communities in this country regard him as some sort of sick joke. `Student centred funding' does not mean `vouchers'. `Vouchers' does not mean `student centred funding'. Pull the other leg, Minister. `It is not strictly a voucher system,' he said. You really have to be kidding. When you are looking at `less is more', have a look at the words of the minister in his second reading speech on the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill yesterday, if you think I am pulling your leg. He said:</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11516">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . funding of $3,783,052,000 in 1999 . . . and . . . $3,581,640,000 in 2000.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is $2,100,000 less. It actually means less. He is going to promote access to higher education and build quality. He has a deliberate strategy to expand both places and resources from the university and, at the same time, change the mix of public and private funding. More is less.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He assists himself by publicity seeking in the press gallery. He is very quick to learn that most journalists up there synthesise information to meet the deadlines that they have every day for their stories. They do not analyse very thoroughly any data and information relating to his portfolio. Education is one portfolio where synthesised stories are next to damn useless.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has taken advantage of the extremely unreliable database that typifies all levels of education in this country. He cannot even find out the number of students here. It is 630,000 in one publication, 580,000 in another and 430,000 in another. No-one seems to know what it is. This is a tactic to discourage rational debate. The minister, once he is in control of that microphone over there, and whenever the facts and figures are raised that question the authenticity of his government's action, goes into denial mode. In fact, he goes much further than that: he turns himself into the `less is more' mode resulting in the debate becoming so confused that no-one in the press gallery can ever be motivated to seriously take up the matter. Good politics some cynics would say, but absolutely rotten policy, Minister. There seems in this a deliberate and a consistent intent to whittle away opportunities for young Australians who come from working&hyphen;class or lower&hyphen; to middle&hyphen;class backgrounds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Several months ago I read an article by a prominent education writer on the history of public and private education in Victoria. I started to wonder, `Why does this person think like this?' The writer pointed out that 50 per cent of the people in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Who's Who</EMPHASIS> in Victoria were educated not just in a private school but in four private schools&mdash;Melbourne Grammar, Geelong Grammar, Scotch College and Wesley College, if I 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> remember correctly. The minister was educated at Scotch, if I remember correctly. Talk about narrow privileged elitism&mdash;you need to look no further than Victoria for that. Of course, the minister, part of the blue&hyphen;blood establishment, was also educated in one of those four schools. By comparison, when you look at the people in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Who's Who</EMPHASIS> in New South Wales, you see that the majority come from public education. The member for Goldstein would have to have the worst attributes, the worst resume and the worst personal experiences to be a minister responsible for managing any public education in this country. He does not care a damn for public education&mdash;and it shows.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The management of higher education now has a focus on the West discussion paper `Learning for life', a review of higher education, financing and policy. Chapter 1 of that discussion paper is instructive. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a feeling of unease in the universities. Higher education has lost its way and is rudderless in a sea of change. The morale of academics is low. Change is unavoidable and urgent.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In setting the framework for the discussion paper in chapter 1, West says that `we must lift our sights and look to the 21st century'. That is a big ask for you, Minister. The member for Werriwa said that you have not changed your mind for 30 years; I was going to be kinder and say you have not changed your mind since 1991. You were the champion of the Fightback proposals before the 1993 election&mdash;and still are. On equity, West states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . no Australian with the intellectual ability to succeed in higher education is denied access owing to his or her social or economic circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That admirable aim is quite incompatible with this minister's background&mdash;narrow, elitist and privileged. West sums up the first chapter by stating:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We should not be blinded to different ways of doing things by the status quo.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The reality for this minister, however, is quite clear. He is not just a believer in the acceptance of the status quo&mdash;he goes further&mdash;he believes in the diminution of the status quo. He is a rare bird. He believes in it going the other way. The last sentence is the most 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11517"> telling as far as this minister is concerned. West says, `We look forward to an open and rational debate.' The minister has deliberately tried every tactic, every strategy, to frustrate any open or rational debate. I think that has been demonstrated by the member for Werriwa and by me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a minister who could not manage a changed process&mdash;assessment of the status quo, adoption, adaption, creation of new paradigms, assessment and evaluation, and continuous review. They are really anathema to you, aren't they? They are not what this minister stands for. This minister is not capable of the challenges of the 21st century. West points out at the end of chapter 2 that there is a great need for flexibility to meet the challenges. He also states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will be through flexibility, adaptability and responsiveness that Australia's higher education system will deliver the kind of education necessary for the 21st century needs and remain competitive in a global arena.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">But no-one on this side of the House is holding their breath for this minister to manage that considerable challenge. Nearly 40 per cent of those who complete year 12 enter higher education within two years of leaving school compared with other OECD countries. Australia's higher education rates for 18&hyphen; to 21&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds are pretty high. We are a good exporter of education. Access by indigenous people has trebled over the last decade, but there are weaknesses, and West points those out. On the voucher system, you just ran.

He says that we are neglecting to acknowledge the benefits to society of higher education. The member for Port Adelaide also goes on to talk about the West report and university's place in society and its benefits. I do not disagree entirely with what they are saying. Obviously, university has always historically had a very important role to play in our society in promoting the concept of learning and education.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, in the 196 pages of the West report&mdash;as shadow minister, I hope you have read the report in terms of its implications&mdash;West has damned the record of the Australian Labor Party. There has been no change in the social composition of students who have actually enjoyed the educational opportunities of this country. Labor did not encourage the alternative educational ladders that these kids have demanded. What was the end result? As night follows day, as the member for Werriwa has mentioned, these kids were put on the unemployment queues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make mention of this because the educational system in this country is more than just simply tertiary education. It is a broad approach in terms of offering educational opportunities for all kids. The former government seems to have had a fixation that the 30 per cent of kids who go to university are the only concern that we should have in this country. They have neglected the other 70 per cent who are also looking for that educational ladder, for that helping hand, to go on and benefit themselves and their families and be worthwhile contributors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In one of the submissions that was made to the employment, education and training committee&mdash;I hope the member for Port Adelaide has read page 56 of the report; I know he was there at the time it was written&mdash;Mr Graeme Trompf from ACT Youth Joblink states:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11518">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Having a qualification these days does not guarantee a job at all&mdash;and that leads to frustration. We have some young people on our books who have graduated from ANU in disciplines that employers regard as fairly esoteric.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He then goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Employers say to them, `That is fine, but how does this help me run my business?' Those young people feel frustrated . . . They have come through the system, they have put in four years at university and find that, on the surface, their qualification is of little assistance in getting a job.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What we find is that the kids out there who are benefiting from this government's policy are looking for a broad approach in terms of the opportunities that are available to them. Yes, university should play a part in benefiting society. But there are benefits to society in getting those young kids off the labour market queues and into jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is taking an integrated approach, not compartmentalising education in terms of secondary school, TAFE and universities. We need this approach. In my own electorate of Deakin we are seeing that taking place. I will speak more about what this government and this minister have done to benefit the young kids who are graduating this year and those who are unable to graduate because of their own difficulties in working their way through the system, but are still looking for a place in society in which they can benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These young kids are looking for a system which incorporates all aspects of opportunities&mdash;the TAFE sector and the university sector. Let us not forget about this. Let us not simply look at this in terms of what we are doing for the university sector; it is also what we are doing in terms of overall vocational education. Education is very important. Our nation needs our young kids to be educated and trained. We recognise the importance that it has in terms of personal development and the employment prospects that are required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Around Deakin about 7,000 students are either at university or in TAFE colleges. We are well served by two excellent TAFE institutions&mdash;Box Hill TAFE and the Outer Eastern College of TAFE. Yet Labor is criticising our broad approach to education and ignoring this other component. The kids 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that we spoke to are saying that they require a job at the end of their education, not simply some sort of esoteric approach, which you are taking. The other 70 per cent, who cannot go on to university, also have an opportunity to benefit from the educational opportunities that are available to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ALP criticise the coalition government for reducing funding and therefore reducing opportunities. They criticise us for the negative impact of differentiated HECS and for the undergraduate fees. What we find is that the university sector, as the minister has so well put, is estimated to have $33 million more. The member for Port Adelaide may talk about cuts but there is more Commonwealth revenue in 1997&mdash;that is, $5.84 billion. For the normal mortal human being&mdash;and the member for Port Adelaide is a normal mortal human being, as I am&mdash;putting our mind around billions is very hard but the university sector will be receiving more money&mdash;$33 million more&mdash;in operating grants. That is equivalent to $11,100 per student.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I see that as a very firm commitment by this government to the 30 per cent of kids who are going to university in addition to the work we are doing for the other 70 per cent. The government is providing increased access for young  Australians and the Commonwealth will be funding undergraduate places. This will achieve an increase of nearly 13,000 between 1996 and 1999. That is a 3.7 per cent increase in three years, of the undergraduate places that we are funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government policy will also enable an increase in funding from the new flexibilities we are introducing. Flexibility is something I would have thought you would encourage rather than perhaps some sort of dogmatic, ideological, hard and fast stance. This government is about flexibility. We do look at the entire scope of education rather than simply, as I mentioned before, the narrowness that you keep talking about. For the first time, in 1998 universities will be able to offer additional undergraduate places above the core level of Commonwealth funded places.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">This bill amends the superannuation legislation to strengthen the efficiency and effectiveness of the superannuation supervisory framework. Superannuation plays a significant role in the government's commitment to increase national saving and in the government's retirement income policy. It is therefore vital that an effective regulatory regime is in place and maintained to enhance the security of members' benefits and to ensure that superannuation entities operate for genuine retirement income purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 (the SIS Act) provides for the prudential regulation of the superannuation industry by the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner. An important aspect of prudential regulation is the monitoring and investigation powers of the commissioner. This bill will improve the commissioner's monitoring and investigation powers by increasing the flexibility of the existing powers, expanding the parties to whom they apply and increasing penalties for non&hyphen;compliance. It is vital to the prudential regulation of superannuation moneys in Australia that the commissioner have effective monitoring and investigation powers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another important aspect of the regulatory framework is the existence of a complaints handling body to deal with members' superannuation complaints. The Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act 1993 (the SRC Act) established the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal to resolve fund mem 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="11520"> bers' complaints about trustee decisions in a manner that is fair, informal and quick. This bill will enable the efficiency and productivity of the tribunal to be improved, including by allowing single member review panels. This will enhance the tribunal's role in promoting public confidence in the superannuation regime. The bill also contains a number of measures which will finetune and clarify the operation of the supervisory framework which will assist trustees in discharging their obligations to fund members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, this bill implements miscellaneous amendments to maintain and strengthen the superannuation supervisory framework. The amendments will increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the regulatory regime and improve confidence in the superannuation system more generally. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Tax Law Improvement Bill (No. 2) 1997 is the third instalment of legislation that is progressively replacing the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. This year parliament enacted the first two instalments of rewritten law. The first instalment established the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 as the main income tax law. It has a new more logical structure, a flexible and user&hyphen;friendly numbering system and is written in plain language appropriate to its audience.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1997 act now contains the core provisions of the law and most of the rules that apply generally, such as the provisions about assessable income and deductions. It also includes some other more specialised rules covering such subjects as mining and primary 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> production deductions. The main feature of this bill is the rewritten rules about capital gains and losses, colloquially known as the capital gains tax or CGT.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Capital Gains Tax</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From its inception in 1985, the CGT provisions have been compromised by the unnecessarily complex approach that was taken to their presentation and expression. The aim of the CGT is to tax income gains made on the disposal of assets and on the receipt of certain capital amounts. Although the CGT applies to many transactions that do not involve the disposal of assets, the existing law squeezes them into its uneasy structure by treating each of them as though it did involve such a disposal. This has left a complex and extremely confusing system of artificial deeming provisions that can confound even experienced professional advisers. The rewrite does away with this `deeming approach' and replaces it with statements which directly describe in clear words the transactions that come within the coverage of the CGT.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The key to the rewrite is the breaking up of the law to identify each `CGT event'. The concept of disposal is to be limited to where there actually is a change in ownership of an asset from one person to another. Other kinds of transactions that can give rise to a CGT liability are brought together so that the reader can be confident that all circumstances that can give rise to a capital gain or loss are comprehensively listed. By bringing together in a coherent way material that is scattered throughout the old law and by doing away with unnecessary text, the rewrite supports a more readily gained understanding by taxpayers of the CGT consequences of their decisions.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Other Areas Rewritten</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A range of other rules with specialised application have also been rewritten and included in the bill. These cover the treatment of company bad debts, intellectual property, horticultural plants, expenditure on protecting the environment and on environmental impact statements, the averaging of primary producers' liabilities and evening out the effects of above&hyphen;average special professional income. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11521">
<PARA STYLE="Para">Minor Policy Changes</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rewritten rules include minor policy changes which will help to make the law simpler, clearer and less burdensome for taxpayers. They will do this by:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The first report that I have tabled concerns the proposed development of facilities, stage 3, at HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Stirling</EMPHASIS> , Western Australia. In brief, the proposal examined by the committee involves the provision of expanded or new facilities to improve operational support, training, logistic support facilities and personnel support. The estimated outturn cost of the proposed development is $19 million. The committee has recommended that the work should proceed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Stirling</EMPHASIS> provides operational, logistic, administrative, personnel and recreational support for assigned and visiting warships as well as port, berthing, shipside and administrative services. The Collins class submarines will be home&hyphen;ported at Stirling. At present, the base supports 2,433 naval and civilian personnel. By the year 2004, when half the Australian fleet is home&hyphen;ported there, this is expected to increase to approximately 3,160. Support demands are, therefore, expected to rise early in the next century when the num 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ber of home&hyphen;ported major units is planned to increase from 10 to about 14. For the benefit of honourable members, I should mention that these units are expected to include seven frigates, comprising both FFG and Anzac class ships, six submarines and one fleet support vessel, together with associated ship&hyphen;borne helicopters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The development of HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Stirling</EMPHASIS> has spanned almost three decades and has involved a number of stages. The parliament, through the public works committee, has been involved throughout this process. The committee has calculated from the five previous reports on the development of naval facilities on the island that the total expenditure so far in 1997 prices has been $459 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a Western Australian and as a chairman of the committee, I can say that all Australians can be proud of what has been achieved. Facilities at HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Stirling</EMPHASIS> are a credit to the Defence Force and to the designers, engineers and the construction industry. The committee has concluded, based on the evidence presented and a detailed inspection of existing facilities, that there is a need to further improve operational support, training, logistics and personnel support facilities at HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Stirling</EMPHASIS>, either by the provision of extensions to existing facilities or through new construction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee also concluded that the extent of the proposed works can be justified as meeting anticipated requirements. The committee has recommended that the Department of Defence should review two components of the proposed works. The first is extensions to facilities proposed for the naval diving clearance teams. The committee has recommended that the review should include the benefits of the construction of a new facility at a more suitable location.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second involves a review of the siting of the flight deck procedural trainer in relation to the overall cost, including the provision of power, without compromising safety or the realism of training scenarios.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of benefits to the local community, the committee was advised that an average of about 70 personnel will be directly employed on construction activities during the 14&hyphen;month 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11523"> construction period. It is likely that local subcontractors will be used on the project. It is also worth noting that the base already contributes about $200 million to the local economy each year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report highlights that the Department of Defence has established an exemplary record in the environmental management of the island. It is worth mentioning that this outstanding record comes at considerable cost: the annual cost of environmental management of the island is at least $430,000. In keeping with past practice, extensive environmental investigations were carried out. Each component of the proposal was tested in relation to justification, siting, the exiting environment and environmental impact assessments were then made. This was a thorough process and a number of changes were made to what was originally proposed in response to recommendations by the Garden Island Environmental Advisory Committee. The Department of Defence has demonstrated a commitment, within operational constraints, towards the conservation and protection for public use of the environmental values of the island.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second report which I have tabled concerns the proposed Australian National Maritime Museum Maritime Heritage Centre at Wharf 7, Pyrmont, New South Wales. The museum was opened in November 1991 and the USA Gallery, the bicentennial gift from the United States of America to the people of Australia, was dedicated in January 1992 by Mr George Bush, then President of the United States. Since its opening, the museum has achieved a number of significant milestones, including the number of visitors attracted by the many artefacts and exhibitions on display. During the current financial year, the total number of visitors passed the two million mark, thereby establishing the museum as one of the most popular museums in Sydney and one of the world's most visited maritime museums. The museum's outreach and travelling exhibitions attract a further 200,000 visitors per annum nationally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposal examined by the committee involves the acquisition by the Commonwealth of a 99&hyphen;year lease for a 2,852 square metre site known as Wharf 7, Pyrmont, and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> for the construction of a building to provide accommodation for its back&hyphen;of&hyphen;house activities, including collection and display areas and a library. The cost of the development, $19.5 million in all, will be borrowed from a major bank or financial institution and repaid over a period of approximately 12 to 14 years, using rental offsets and income earned from commercial activities on the site, which include the renting of some of the space. The committee has recommended that the work should proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee has concluded that the Australian National Maritime Museum, as a national institution, plays a key role in reflecting Australia's maritime heritage and culture through public displays, restoration, storage and research. Leased premises, some distance from its main exhibition building in Pyrmont, house museum support activities, including the growing store of artefacts and other material. The lease on these premises expires in mid&hyphen;1999, when the site will be available for redevelopment. There is a need to find other suitable accommodation to house the museum's support activities, preferably adjacent to the main exhibition building. The Commonwealth has been offered a property adjacent to the main exhibition building for development, contingent upon the inclusion of elements of the Sydney Maritime Museum in any new facility and that any museum development adhere to local planning schemes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Based on the evidence provided to the committee, the site is considered suitable for the proposed building to house the museum's library, laboratories, workshops, collection display areas, meeting rooms, amenities and offices. The design of the proposed building recognises planning parameters and, based on the evidence, will meet the museum's functional and spatial requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee believes the success of the proposed development depends on providing a readily identifiable link between the main exhibitions building and the centre and the resolution of public liability issues. This will require the museum to discuss further with the City West Development Corporation and the Council of the City of Sydney issues of public liability and the placement of objects

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I was interrupted by the minor distraction of question time, we were talking about a number of diverse provisions in this omnibus bill, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6) 1997. The fourth of the provisions to which I want to draw attention relates to the payments of tax by small companies. The definitions of small, medium and large companies are to be varied for the purposes of payment times for company tax. Small companies will be able to pay their income tax slightly later than at present. The cost of this proposal is negligible, which, of course, means that any benefit conferred on small business is negligible. However, the opposition is happy to provide even a small benefit for small business and we are supporting the proposals in schedule 5.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next area relates to dividend imputation and retirement savings accounts. When retirement savings accounts were introduced, the government quite rightly promised they would be taxed in the same manner as complying 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> superannuation funds. The original legislation is effective for ordinary companies. However, the government mucked up the treatment of life assurance companies. Schedule 6 of the bill will ensure that franking credits or debits will be prevented from arising from the payment or refund of tax where those amounts are attributable to the retirement savings account business of a life assurance company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This treatment is consistent with the special rules that already apply to life assurance companies, reflecting the unique structure and regulation of the industry. The Labor Party supports levelling the playing field in this area. I note in passing that this is yet another area of superannuation that the government has not got right. We have had the incredible saga of the new surcharge tax which has shown the superannuation industry just how bad this government can be if it really tries. I certainly hope that these provisions are more effective than the surcharge mess that the government has created.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sixth item concerns deductible expenditure and capital gains tax cost bases. The amounts that are deductions for income tax purposes which also form part of the cost base of assets for capital gains tax purposes will now have to be excluded from cost bases. This is to eliminate an effective double deduction for such expenditures&mdash;that is, they both reduce the taxable income flow from an asset and the amount of the gain on the holding of the asset. This measure is estimated to raise $330 million over a period of four years when introduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 2 November this year, the Treasurer (Mr Costello) issued press release No. 117 which provided transitional relief worth $135 million over four years which will ameliorate the provisions as they were originally announced. The opposition welcomes this change, as we were concerned about the short&hyphen;term impact of the measure on employment, especially in the building and construction sectors and possibly also in the tourism and hospitality sectors. We have not yet had sufficient time to fully consult on these changes. However, I understand they have the support of industry. We will examine them closely prior to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11525"> Senate consideration of the bill and will make our views known more fully at that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The seventh item concerns the passive income of insurance companies. The formulae used for determining the passive income&mdash;that is, the non&hyphen;trading income&mdash;of the controlled foreign companies of insurance companies is flawed. Accordingly, a new formula is to be adopted from 1 July this year to fix that problem. The measure is estimated to raise $10 million per annum. The opposition supports measures which ensure that foreign jurisdictions cannot be used to unfairly reduce the amount of tax paid by business. These amendments ensure that Australian tax cannot be avoided and Labor also supports these proposals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The eighth item concerns the average calculated liabilities of life insurance companies. Currently, the tax law requires that life companies use calculated liabilities at the end of the financial year for determining the amount of income to be allocated to immediate annuity policies, the amount of income attributable to policies issued by overseas branches and the amount of income and capital gains to be allocated to each class of assessable income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill proposes the method of calculation will change to the average calculated liabilities. The reason for the change is that using calculated liabilities at the end of the year can cause distortions to the life companies' income calculations if the proportion at the end of the year does not reflect the experience during the year. Changing to the average calculated liabilities method will address this problem. The issue, while being obscure and technical to most people, is very important and the amendments are expected to protect revenue of about $100 million per annum. Labor believes this $100 million ought to be available to the public for providing health care, education services and other vital public services and should not be at risk. Therefore, we also support this measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ninth item concerns depreciation of assets. The final area of this complex bill concerns previously tax exempt entities, usually government businesses which have been privatised. Schedule 10 of the bill 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> clarifies the Taxation Office's interpretation of existing depreciation provisions applying to formerly tax exempt entities which became the subject of taxation between 1 July 1988 and 2 July 1995. There have apparently been some disputes between taxpayers and the tax office about the correct technical interpretation of the existing law. Hopefully, these provisions will clarify these matters and protect the revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is of some concern that the opposition was notified only this morning that there will now be amendment to these provisions, which will apparently preserve the position of a particular taxpayer who has already obtained one of these binding private rulings on this issue. I will speak later to this amendment, but the opposition accepts that it would be unconscionable to override a binding ruling, obtained by a taxpayer in good faith, in a situation which, at least on the face of it, does not involve tax avoidance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As usual, the opposition is very cooperative in protecting the interests of the Australian community by supporting clamp downs on tax rorts, as I have just detailed. The opposition has a very constructive proposal in this area&mdash;an amendment which has twice been supported by the Senate to the charter of budget honesty legislation. That amendment requires the Commissioner of Taxation and the Secretary to the Treasury to provide a report on any material threats to the integrity of the tax system, including the fiscal impact of any of these threats, as a permanent and integral part of fiscal reporting; that is, in the budget papers, the mid-year review. This is a very important proposal because it will allow the government, especially the Treasurer, to be held accountable for the conduct of tax policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition believes that there can be few duties of higher importance of the Treasurer than to maintain a fair tax system. Critical to that is that the current tax base be maintained. We are concerned to ensure that the revenue authority's concerns are made public to enable scrutiny of the Treasurer's performance in his duty of protecting the public revenue. The Commissioner of Taxation can advise the Treasurer on matters that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11526"> should be undertaken to maintain the tax base, but he has no power to force the Treasurer to act in the national interest. The discretion is all with the Treasurer&mdash;to either accept or reject the advice of the tax office and the Treasury&mdash;all in comfortable secrecy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment does not seek to alter the Treasurer's right to make tax policy on behalf of the government, but we do seek to ensure that material threats to the taxation system are codified on a systematic public basis so as to enable the performance of the Treasurer, in dealing with these revenue threats, to be openly evaluated. Future Treasurers will still be able to refuse to act on the advice of the revenue authorities, but they will not be able to hide their actions&mdash;or lack of action&mdash;from the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In opposing this measure, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator Ian Campbell) made two ludicrous claims: firstly, that the few pages of information in the statement of risks in Budget Paper No. 1 actually cover this issue. This is rubbish. We are looking for an independent statement which will provide much more detail on specific schemes and issues which will complement the broad information already provided. Secondly, the laughable notion that publication of information about schemes or other threats to the tax base will in fact increase their use. The Taxation Office does not dream up theoretical schemes. The Taxation Office and the Treasury detect taxpayer behaviour&mdash;often many years after it has become established practice&mdash;and then advise the government of the problems and possible solutions. It is simply wrong to suggest that the tax office could advise the taxation industry on ways to avoid tax; the contrary is the case. If this principle were correct, then the tax office should never take any taxpayers to court on the basis that a loss in the courts would alert taxpayers to possible schemes. Clearly that is utterly at odds with current practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> What we do know, though, is that the tax system and the threat to its integrity is under constant and sustained attack and, in some instances, this is as a direct result of government legislation opening up loopholes such as the family trust loss changes which we debat 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ed recently. In other cases, it arises through a lack of action on tax avoidance through allowing such things as salary repackaging by senior public servants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we believe that risks to the integrity of the tax system will always exist, the opposition is convinced that one way of ensuring that these risks are properly dealt with by the Treasurer is by ensuring that the government can be held accountable for inaction. That amendment achieves that goal. The government has now laid aside the bill which had this amendment made to it; that is, they are afraid of the Treasurer being held accountable for his actions, or lack thereof, in dealing with tax avoidance schemes and other material threats to the tax base such as the ones in the bill before us today. The opposition and the Australian public are very concerned by this behaviour by the government and I urge them to reconsider our proposals, which would make more open and transparent the revenue threats faced by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this cognate debate, we are also considering the  Medicare Levy Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997 . I would like to touch briefly on this bill before concluding. The Medicare levy is a revenue measure which is levied to partially offset the cost of Medicare, the national universal health insurance system. The Medicare levy is a flat rate yet progressive levy which is not paid by low income individuals, couples or low income families. The exemption threshold below which no Medicare levy is payable increases by $2,100 for each dependent child in the family, which recognises that families with children face higher costs than couples with no children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill continues the annual practice of Labor to adjust the Medicare levy low income exemption thresholds upwards. Each year in the budget, the new thresholds are announced and this annual bill legislates the announced changes. The bill proposes to increase the exemption thresholds for 1997-98 to $13,389 for individuals and $22,594 for families. The family and single parent exemption threshold continues to be increased by $2,100 for each dependent child. The cost of the measure is $3 million in 1997-98, $35 million in 1998-99 and $18 million in each of the next two 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11527"> financial years. In continuing past Labor practice, it is supported by Labor.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R372">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6) 1997</XREF>  and <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R369">Medicare Levy Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997</XREF>  before us this evening are joined at the hip in this debate because they are both about equity, responsibility and incentive. In fact, those three words sum up some of the hallmarks of the Howard government and they certainly stand for that to a great range of Australians. Everybody in this nation has a part to play in looking after themselves while also contributing to others in the country who are perhaps less able to look after themselves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to deal with a number of the measures in particular in the taxation laws bill and then go on to the medicare levy bill. But, before doing that, I would like to take a moment of the House's time to comment on the contribution by the honourable member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson). People on this side of the chamber find it extraordinary that those opposite have now decided to very publicly amend the government's fine  Charter of Budget Honesty Bill 1996 . Those opposite talk about measures and say if only they had had a 14th or 15th year in office they might have done the same things themselves. In this debate we are hearing, quite rightly, support from those opposite for a number of the sensible measures this government has put forward in these bills. We are getting support and recognition from them now they are in opposition that this government is doing the right thing by the people of Australia in trying to close down some rorts in a couple of areas and ensuring that companies in the corporate sector as well as individuals pay their share of contributions to this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Their support tonight is welcome, but it is worth noting in this debate that in the time they were in government these same things existed but nothing was done. All we saw from those opposite for the small business sector was a series of reports&mdash;27 reports in 13 years&mdash;all recommending further reports and further inquiries going absolutely nowhere.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CK6">Mr HARDGRAVE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For the benefit of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, at the table, 27. The bills before us contain a number of measures. I do not intend to detail them all. As the member for Wills said, some of them might seem obscure and technical. I agree with his comment: they are all important, that is why they are there. One measure relates to capital loss changes to prevent companies from amplifying the effect of their losses several times through the capital gains tax provisions. We are tidying this up, we are making it fairer and we essentially are closing down what some could see as being a bit of a rort of the system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is really important to small business in my electorate that we recognise the need to extend the time that is needed by small business companies to pay tax. This measure provides them with an extension of time. It gives them an opportunity to plan their payment of tax into the system. So they pay their share but with greater sympathy to their need to plan properly. Under this legislation, they will pay their likely tax liability on 15 December following the income year and they will pay the balance of their tax liability, if applicable, by 15 March the following year. This measure is consistent with a result that came out of one of our inquiries into small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have looked at small business a couple of times, but we have actually come up with results. The More Time for Business announcement&mdash;the response by the government&mdash;on 24 March detailed this measure and the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) quickly responded to the Reid report on small business activities which came up with a whole bunch of other measures which were before us in this place as legislative measures within a handful of weeks of that report being tabled. There is a direct contrast between this government and its predecessor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These measures will take effect in the 1996&hyphen;97 tax year, so next year small business taxpayers in my electorate of Moreton will have that extension of time. I think it will assist small business to be able to plan, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11528"> particularly in that lead&hyphen;up to the Christmas busy time when there is a lot of extra expense and the possibility of staff going on holidays. I think that is a very good measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another one of the measures I particularly want to highlight is the reversal of the absolutely pathetically stupid Labor Party measure in relation to fringe benefits tax for employees of small businesses who happen to park their car on the premises. That was regarded as a fringe benefit and was taxed. Employers, mainly small business employers, were particularly penalised. They had to tell their employees to park their cars down the road well away from the business. They had to set a minimum distance from the door, otherwise a fringe benefits tax was involved. What a ridiculous measure! It was an anti&hyphen;small business and downright un&hyphen;Australian measure the Labor Party presided over for many years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today the Australian Labor Party are actually supporting this  reversal of their stupid policy. I welcome the support, but it strikes me as being strange that, in all the years they were in power, they never did anything about it. The only exception will be those businesses which pay employees to park at a commercial car parking station. I think all Australians agree we have got some commonsense, some good sense, back into the running of this country through this particular measure alone. This is part of the government's response to the deregulation task force report of November last year. Here is another practical response from the government as a result of an inquiry. That is in direct contrast to Labor. This measure takes $5 million out of the budget; it is well spent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next measure I want to talk about is the savings rebate measure which establishes the criteria by which people are encouraged to save and enhance their private income system, particularly in view of their retirement years. The technical measures involved allow people who are in business in particular to contribute up to $3,000 a year to their retirement. In fact, these measures encourage people to do just that. Let us face it: one of the big complaints we got before the last election was that people were sick to death of being taxed on their savings. In the main, their money had 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> already been taxed before it was put in the bank and it was being taxed again. The government has not completely removed that quite sad situation which discouraged saving. It has, though, taken the first step in the right direction. Unlike those opposite who promised l&hyphen;a&hyphen;w tax cuts which were g&hyphen;o&hyphen;n&hyphen;e right before our very eyes, this is f&hyphen;a&hyphen;c&hyphen;t. It has happened. It will apply from next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to spend the rest of my time contributing to the second of the two bills we are talking about&mdash; Medicare Levy Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997 . This is another sign of this government's commitment to Medicare: a universal health system which we all make a contribution towards. We want to ensure that all Australians have access to medical services at a fair cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This measure lifts the low income threshold, the exemption threshold, so that more low income individuals, low income married couples, low income sole parents, low income families, are actually exempt from the Medicare levy. I am not a low income earner. Nobody in this place is. By comparison to so many Australians, it seems fair to me that we should pay in a progressive sense a greater contribution to ensure the system does look after those who cannot afford to pay a contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think anybody really regrets the levy we pay towards Medicare, even though it meets only an infinitesimal part of the overall cost of the health budget&mdash;and I will go into that in a moment. These increases were announced in May in the second Costello budget. The thresholds for the 1997&hyphen;98 financial year will be increased to $13,389 for individuals and $22,594 for families. The family threshold will continue to rise $2,100 for each dependent child.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These increased exemption thresholds result in changes to income ranges over which the particular exemptions are shaded out. The new upper limits of the ranges for individuals and families will be $14,474 and $24,425 respectively. Of course, no&hyphen;one is going to argue against this measure. It is an equity measure and it ensures that those who are in the poorest position of all in this country are going to be afforded access to Medicare, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11529"> access to bulk&hyphen;billing, even though they are not in the position of making a contribution. There is no additional contribution cost to taxpayers as a result of this measure but the cost to the budget is $3 million this year, $35 million in the next financial year and $18 million in 1999&hyphen;2000 and also in the following year's budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is certainly a great deal of balance in this whole area of publicly funded health versus private health. Increasing costs are, I guess, part and parcel of that. Those who pay for the benefits<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">received by low income earners certainly would have an expectation that low income earners themselves would not overuse this service, this benefit, because there is a real house of cards potentially in the area of health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Medicare should be and will continue to be, as a result of this government's commitment, there for all Australians as a measure of absolute certainty. But those who can afford to pay for private health insurance arrangements should of course be doing so. That is certainly what this government has done with what you could call, I guess, its carrot and stick approach. As far as private health insurance incentives and penalties for higher income earners are concerned, that is what that approach is all about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is frustrating when you are trying to run a health insurance and a health system to note there are some who really are not doing the right thing by all taxpayers and all Australians. One of my local pharmacists told me a story the other day which I would like to offer to the chamber for consideration. He said an older lady came in the other day and wanted to buy a box of Panamax, which is a paracetamol product. She refused to pay the $5.50 for the box of Panamax; in fact, she wanted it for $3.20, which is the PBS rate and the rate she would have paid if she had a script for this product. It is interesting to note the dispensed value of Panamax is in fact $7.43, which is paid by the government less whatever it is the particular purchaser contributes. So if you and I were to go in, we would buy Panamax, I guess, for $5.50, which would offset the $7.43. A pensioner or some 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> body on a pharmaceutical benefit would pay only $3.20.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of the day, the lady went down the corridor to a particular doctor who bulk&hyphen;billed, which cost the Australian taxpayer $21. She got the script, went back to the pharmacist, and paid her $3.20&mdash;which was $4.23 worth of taxpayer subsidy on top of the $21 it had cost to go to the doctor. All round, there was a total cost of $25.23 to buy a box of Panamax, which was $5.50 retail. I am sure a lot of people in this place would be disturbed to know that the system which we are providing to ensure all Australians have equitable access could be so abused.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was another story earlier this year in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> magazine&mdash;certainly a reputable magazine. It recounted the story of the woman who cut her finger. She went to the doctor, who said, `This cut to your finger does not require a stitch. Why are you here? It just needs a bandaid.' She said, `To buy a box of bandaids will cost me a couple of dollars. If I come to you, I put my card down in the machine, you bulk&hyphen;bill, and the bandaid costs me absolutely nothing.' I do not think that is the spirit in which Medicare is meant to operate. It is a very sad indictment that some Australians could feel so desperate and could be in a position where a couple of dollars is all-important. I accept that can be the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is very hard to know what to do about it, because it is a hornet's nest. To start to raise some concerns like this raises a whole bunch of issues and additional pressure perhaps on the system. The last thing I want to see is pressure building to the point where cost built into the system starts to bring the system down, because it is an important system to maintain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs, which released a report earlier this week called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Health On Line</EMPHASIS>. Its recommendation 6.32 talks about components relating to Medicare bulk&hyphen;billing and the fact that we need to look at the MedClaim system which looks at electronic transfer of the transactions. So doctors could be literally paid overnight, and the relationship becomes 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11530"> doctor to Medicare. The doctor might require the patient to top it up, as my doctor does. I have to pay about $8 to $10, I think, on top of the Medicare amount to my doctor. That is a separate relationship. So doctors could be paid directly and that may in itself provide something. Rather than go into the ins and outs of this report from the standing committee, it is worth noting that the Labor Party in their minority and dissenting report essentially agree with the government members' findings of this committee. I commend it as a document which is worth reflecting upon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) in his reply to the report reflects upon that, because there is some good sense in what they are saying. It is drawing out the value and the cost of the services and making it obvious to the person who uses the service that Medicare is not a free thing; it does actually cost money. So maybe we will see fewer examples of the lady who wanted the Panamax and the person who wanted the bandaids. I think that would be a good thing and would restore a greater deal of faith in the overall system, as far as all Australians are concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As this measure before us shows, this government is committed to Medicare. We are committed to bulk&hyphen;billing. We know that low income people in particular need this. I know plenty of friends of mine whose families need this. They need to know they do not have to rustle around looking for money to pay the doctor's bill if their child needs access to a doctor. We understand that bulk&hyphen;billing has an important place and this government is committed to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also very important, which is why I raise it in this place today, for all Australians to understand there is a cost involved in our health insurance schemes, both public and private. The community&mdash;the taxpayer essentially&mdash;pays for Medicare, but individuals in the community of course pay the cost of the community. The total amount of money generated as a result of the Medicare levy is only $3.7 billion. The total health cost in this country is $40 billion. So less than 10 per cent is actually generated from the levy. The federal government kicks in another $22 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> billion on top of what is generated out of the levy. So the government is certainly putting money where its mouth is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we have to rely upon and hope that individuals do their best to make a contribution themselves. If they are able to afford it, they should take out private health insurance, because it takes pressure off the public system. Likewise, those who cannot afford to do so&mdash;low income earners in particular&mdash;should realise they too have a duty, which is not to overuse and abuse the privilege afforded them because of government policy as far as access to health care is concerned. We should make sure that, while we are looking after those who need care, we do not run the risk of bringing down the whole house of cards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to reflect upon the fact that the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating, never took out private health insurance. It is interesting to note that the current Leader of the Opposition in Queensland, Mr Beattie, was appointed health minister in the dying days of the failed Goss government and the first thing he did was take out private health insurance because he said now he was on a ministerial allowance he could afford it. I cannot understand how somebody like Peter Beattie could never have taken it upon himself, as some sort of civic duty as a leader in the community, to actually contribute something towards offsetting the cost to the community of providing health services to those who desperately need it. You do not need people who are on $80,000 a year standing in the queue at public hospitals. They are mainly there for the lower income earners. I think that is the beauty of Medicare. I certainly do not mind, and I am sure you do not, Mr Deputy Speaker, making your contribution to ensuring the system works and continues to work well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said at the beginning, these bills before us are all about equity. They are all about responsibility. They are all about accountability. They are all about ensuring every Australian plays their part in making a contribution to the cause of the better running of this country. It is very important those higher income earners who stay out of private health insurance are in fact in private health insurance, because the more of them who stay out 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11531"> of health insurance the harder it is for the lower income earners. I am very pleased to be part of a government which has shown the lead in this. It has taken a carrot and a stick approach. It has offered incentives for people to get into private health insurance and penalties for higher income earners who are not in it. I say that is fair enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a turnaround in recent weeks in the number of people who are staying in private health insurance. I was delighted, in a response the minister gave me to a question in this place about this matter last week, to see the graph start to kick up. After so many years of the Labor Party turning its back on the fact people were leaving private health insurance, the government has done something about it. Those opposite spend a lot of time carping about it, complaining it is not good enough and not enough is being done, but something has been done. It is a sign perhaps the richer people in our community realise they will get a penalty if they are not in private health insurance. I do not care what reason is attached to it: the more people who are in private health insurance, the better it is going to be for lower income Australians, because they are not going to be in such a long queue at the public system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is a great pity private health insurance providers have not played their part. They have essentially upped premiums to soak up the government's own initiatives and incentives. There are plenty of people in my electorate who are very angry about it. But I was delighted to see the Minister for Health and Family Services today introduce another measure, which will be debated next week, relating to the need to force private health insurance providers to give a greater range of products and a greater range of flexibility and to reward people who have been in private health insurance for years&mdash;another positive and constructive measure from this government, as this bill before us here is today. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening I want to recount the circumstances of a person who was a constituent of mine for a year or so who had the unfortunate experience of being taken for a ride I think by an immigration consultant. I want to tell the House about the situation of Dusan Marjanovic, a young man who arrived in Australia in 1986 on a tourist visa. A few weeks before his visa was due to expire, Dusan was introduced to a Mr Reg Faulkner, who is the principal of International Lobbyists. He told Dusan that, with his contacts in politics, in the police and, might I say, even in ASIO, he could arrange permanent residency for him and that all it would take was some money. To start with, that was $3,500. Six weeks later Dusan parted with another $1,500 because Mr Faulkner said the applications would be difficult. As time marched on little occurred.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In November 1988, Mr Faulkner advised Dusan to return to Yugoslavia so that the immigration process could be arranged from there. In Yugoslavia he received letters from Reg Faulkner inviting him to come to Australia for six months to learn about the country before being appointed his company's Yugoslavia based agent. You might be asking about the quest for permanent residency in Australia, because so was my former constituent, but he had invested so much money and time in Reg Faulkner and his company that he felt he had no choice but to continue down that track. In May 1990, after selling his possessions, Dusan returned to Australia. By August, Dusan had paid Faulkner and his company another $4,200 for so-called government fees and for `priority consideration' by an influential&mdash;as it was reported to him&mdash;immigration officer, taking the total amount to $9,200.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A week later, Faulkner told Dusan that the influential immigration official that he had contacts with had retired and that no-one in Canberra knew where he had gone. For five more years this went on. Dusan claims that Faulkner has actually asked him for money on at least 60 occasions. In total, over a period 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11532"> of about eight years, Dusan paid Reg Faulkner $27,000 and still had no permanent residency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In March 1995, Dusan decided to forgo Reg Faulkner's assistance. Yet he knew that, if there were to be any chance of retrieving any of the money he had invested, he would have to stay on friendly terms. Interestingly, I might add, between 1990 and 1995, Dusan worked for Mr Faulkner but received no pay. For a period of five years, he received board and lodging but no pay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In August 1995, Mr Faulkner applied for a Parliament House photographic security pass. The application was sponsored and signed by the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott), and the current Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock). By January 1996, Mr Faulkner was reassuring Dusan that `his people'&mdash;being his contacts within the Liberal Party&mdash;were about to come to power, and he boasted about his connections. To be fair, I think Mr Faulkner used to boast about his connections everywhere, in all parts of the system. On this occasion, he was certainly boasting about his contacts in the Liberal Party. In May 1996, Dusan thought it was time to seek legal advice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Several months later, he came to my office seeking help. He got it. Just after Easter this year, his permanent residency was approved. The immigration officials told my staff that someone had lodged an objection to Dusan Marjanovic's application for permanent residency, but the claims against him had not been substantiated. I think it would illuminate the situation if we were to know the details of the people behind that objection to Dusan's application for permanent residency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members of parliament frequently find themselves having a number of acquaintances whom they either do not really know or have never really met, but in the case of Mr Faulkner and the endorsement of his photographic pass by the member for Warringah and the minister for immigration, this seems to be more than a passing acquaintance. Those members signed his parliamentary security pass in 1995 and, just this year, on 28 May, both members attended a meeting with the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) to

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Shortly I will seek leave to table a paper prepared for me by Elizabeth Lang, from Grinnell College, Iowa, in the United States. Elizabeth is in Australia as part of the Australian national internships program, and I have been fortunate indeed to have Elizabeth prepare for me a paper titled, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">It's like being in a war: Children's programs in women's refuges in Australia</EMPHASIS> .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In her outstanding paper Elizabeth states that, traditionally, the family home has been a safe haven, a place where people love and respect one another. Unfortunately, this is not always the case. In Australia, as many as one in three households suffers from domestic violence. Women are not the only victims of domestic violence; children are often the silent victims. Although they may not be physically abused, children must bear the emotional scars of seeing one parent attack another. Even when the violence does not occur in their presence, children are usually aware of any violence which occurs in the home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Children suffer because of the emotional atmosphere in an abusive household. One 10-year-old boy likened his home situation to living in a war. Many children become so upset that they are unable to attend school after a domestic violence dispute. As many as 11,000 students in New South Wales and 8,000 in Western Australia miss school every day because of domestic violence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Children who witness violence learn to become inured and believe that this is acceptable. They grow up believing that men should be dominating and women should be submissive&mdash;that women do not deserve men's respect. Children from violent homes tend to have more significant behavioural and social problems than other children. They may also experience depression, withdrawal, anxiety, eating disorders, nervous disorders, self&hyphen;abuse and nightmares. School work no longer 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11533"> becomes important to children so grades tend to fall dramatically. Adolescent boys and girls from abusive homes are themselves more likely to become involved in abusive relationships because that is all they know.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Children are the majority of the residents in women's refuges. These children have their own needs separate from the needs of their mothers. Unfortunately, these needs are often ignored because the main focus is on the mother. Children in refuges have been torn away from all that is familiar, leaving behind their homes, their toys, their clothes, their friends, their schools and their fathers. Children in refuges need someone they can trust, who is interested in their fears and feelings and who can help them work through them. A child worker can fulfil these needs by helping children build self-esteem, teaching them that they are special and worth while and teaching them how to take care of themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The child worker in many refuges becomes the child's helper, working one on one with the children, learning about them and helping them to recover from their traumatic experiences. A child worker also reassures children that the violence is not their fault. The worker teaches the child that violence is not acceptable and that men do not have the right to hit a woman and a woman does not have to accept the violence. If children do not learn that violence is inappropriate, then the cycle of violence will continue in future generations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Children also need interaction with other children who have experienced domestic violence. Group programs assist children to understand their situation, work through their fears, raise their self-esteem and learn appropriate behaviour. These programs focus on a different issue each week, using techniques appropriate to the child's age.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Refuges also need a counsellor who can work directly with the children. By having counsellors on staff, children can develop a stronger relationship with them and heal that much faster. Children who have lived in a violent home suffer from psychological, emotional and behavioural problems. They need a child worker, a counsellor and group 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> programs in the refuge to help them overcome the experience and move on with their lives. Without these programs to help children overcome this trauma, they will not only suffer as children but also as adults as they themselves continue the cycle of violence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to thank Elizabeth Lang particularly for her thoroughly researched report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">It's like being in a war: Children's programs in women's refuges in Australia</EMPHASIS> and again commend the Australian national internships program to the House.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am proud to be associated with the family resource centre which has operated in my electorate. I am proud that I can say that I was there and chaired the first public meeting to get it on the road. I am proud that an organisation such as the Brotherhood of St Laurence was the interim sponsor. I am proud that an able group of local people came together to be the committee of management. I am proud of the work that was done by the family resource centre.

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11534"> Michael Gourlay, who has managed the program since its inception, all the best in his future career.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I regret that we have come to this outcome. I regret that we, here today, have to talk about what is going to be a devastating blow for the many organisations and families that have gained some benefit from this family resource centre. The community, post the budget decision, has acted responsibly. They have not only continued a campaign to try to have this decision reversed but also looked at ways they can maximise ongoing benefit from the years that we have had the family resource centre.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Family resource centres were first mentioned in the Governor&hyphen;General's speech in May 1990. The Whittlesea Plenty Valley FRC was opened in September 1992 and has successfully operated since then. In response to the budget this year, I organised a meeting of those interested and formed a group called Friends of the FRC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will read a number of the organisations that were represented on Friends of the FRC. They include organisations such as: Lalor Living &amp; Learning Centre; North Eastern Health Care Network Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services; Bitola Macedonian Senior Citizens Group; Whittlesea Northern Cypriot Women's Group; Thomastown Greek Elderly Citizens Group; Whittlesea Maltese Senior Citizens Group; YMCA&mdash;Mill Park Leisure Centre; CD Counselling Services; Women's Health in the North; Children's Protection Society; Happy Faces Child Care Centre; Kildonan Child and Family Services; Plenty Community Credit Union; Anglicare Plenty Valley (St John's) Care Force; Northern Melbourne Institute of TAFE; Home Tutor Scheme; RMIT Social Work; and Community Information Whittlesea.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are a number of the organisations which thought it important to come together to try to have the decision reversed. They are only a sample of the literally hundreds of groups that were helped by the family resource centre. In the letter that I received from the then Minister for Family Services she alleged that one of the reasons that the program was to be finalised was that it had 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> completed its task. I can assure you that in my electorate the family resource centre is a continuing, well needed resource. The fact is that the family resource centre had set out a strategic plan and it had developed a community needs project to see what it could continue to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I really wonder what this government thinks it is doing. It artificially thinks that by saving paltry amounts of money it is really working to the community's good. I put to the government that for the money that was spent on the family resource centres in my area there was a multiplier effect that cannot be estimated. It cannot be thrown aside.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Each of the groups was assisted, had training for their committees of management or was able to use the volunteer register that was put together. We cannot just look at these things in dollar and cents terms, the bottom line, and take it out of the budget. What we have to look at is outcomes. If this government is really on about expending money in the most efficient way and getting the best results, it should not repeat decisions like this to close down the family resource centre program. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="11534"><TITLE>Parliament House: Visit by Students</TITLE>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whether he is believed is another matter!</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is the stereotypical image of a politician, a conception by which we ourselves had been blinded prior to our visit this week.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While Question Time during our visit proved controversial amongst heated debate, we have watched history in the making with the Wik debate beginning in the Senate. Both glimpses at Parliament in action has at times been humorous, at other times inspiring.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However we do note a lack of women on the front bench of both parties, and often question the lack of respect shown for fellow members. Indeed, experiencing Question Time for the first time we were astounded at the moments of seemingly disrespectful loudness of some Members and felt sympathy for those hardly heard.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Away from the Houses our week has offered a glimpse at the vast network of politicians and their staff who work long hours, tirelessly, for the people they represent. We would like to thank those Members and Senators who kindly gave of their time to meet and talk with us.</PARA>

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our conversations were informative on careers, life within the Parliament and party ideologies. Many members' staff, including Greg Hunt from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Tony Nutt from the Prime Minister's Office, offered their time and provided an opportunity for us to learn about the vast number of career options behind the scenes at Parliament House and the means of achieving them.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Communication with the people of Australia is fundamental to democracy.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is quite encouraging that Australians are increasingly taking an interest in their history and heritage issues. The preservation of heritage and historical sites is particularly important in growing urban areas of the country. I think the Commonwealth has a very important role to play in assisting in that respect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are 16 hectares of Commonwealth&hyphen;owned land in my electorate which the Department of Finance and Administration presently has on the market. It is land that is industrially zoned but somewhat limited in its use because it is on the southern approaches to Melbourne airport. However, it is the site of a historic homestead for that particular part of Melbourne. Harrick's Homestead, as it is known, dates back to 1861. It housed, amazingly when one sees it, a family of 12 during the 1880s. It has become part of the area's history. It has ongoing associations with the area because descendants of the Harrick family remain in the area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not just local people who recognise the significance of this particular site. The Australian Heritage Commission notified the Keilor Historical Society in August this year that the site had been added to the register of the national estate. Local and regional historical societies are all actively supporting some form of protection for this particular homestead in the context of the Commonwealth disposing of the 16 hectares.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the Brimbank City Council is requesting that the Minister for Finance and Administration (Mr Fahey) give urgent attention to, as a minimum, is excising 1.1 hectares from the 16 hectares to enable a contained area of this Commonwealth land to be preserved so that Harrick's Homestead can be preserved as part of the local history of the north&hyphen;west of Melbourne. The local council is also, in association with the Heritage Commission, asking the Commonwealth to consider developing a conservation plan for the site in the terms that are required by the Australian Heritage Act and are seeking assistance from the Commonwealth in assessing the work that needs to be done to restore the property to permanent ongoing public use. If the site is lost, a valuable piece of history of that part of Melbourne will be lost in the process of the Commonwealth disposing of the site, if the minister is not prepared to act promptly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I indicated, the land is very much on the southern approaches into Melbourne airport so there are somewhat limited potential uses for it despite the industrial zoning. I do not have a valuation on what 1.1 hectares of it would cost the Commonwealth, but it is certainly not going to be a huge sum of money. It seems to me that, given the sort of focus the Commonwealth is wanting to give to heritage and historical issues in the lead&hyphen;up to the centenary of Federation, this is a most important opportunity for the Commonwealth to show that it will work with local communities, local historical societies and local councils to ensure that important heritage and historical locations all around the country are protected so future generations can see how pioneers of the last century lived and what sorts of houses and homesteads they lived in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that is very important for our sense of ourselves as a nation and in terms of understanding where we have come from. I urge the minister, as I will be doing in writing tomorrow after having made this contribution to the adjournment debate, to give very rapid attention to the excision as requested by the local community and to ensure some Commonwealth support for the conservation and planning process in ensuring that proper attention is given to restoring the property.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The `three strikes and you're in' law was, as I said, formulated because of the increase in juvenile crime. I want to speak specifically about a case involving Mr Byrne&hyphen;King, who was beaten outside his home this year. He went out to see who was breaking into his car and was bashed absolutely senseless. His 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> family was inside and when they pursued the thugs who were bashing him, the thugs turned on them also.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Just by way of interest, when the witnesses attended court this week the parents of the boys charged bashed them. The accused, a 16&hyphen;year&hyphen;old boy, and his 15&hyphen;year&hyphen;old cousin failed to appear. They did not bother turning up to the court case. But their supporters turned up and bashed some of the witnesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My point is: if you commit an adult crime, you should expect an adult punishment. I am very concerned that some people think because you are under the age of 18 you are above the law or above receiving the same justice the law would deliver to an adult. I have had to deal with people who stole my car out of my garage. They were 14 and they were pretty big. I can assure you that it would have been a nice old to&hyphen;do if I had tried to tackle them, and I am not as small as some people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I would like to say to Mr Alan Rose QC and Justice Fenbury of the Children's Court of Western Australia is: yes, there are education programs to deal with juvenile criminals. I would like to praise one within my electorate in the City of Belmont run by the sergeant of the Belmont police station, Sergeant Fred Healed, who has recently been decorated for his efforts in education and reduction of crime. In fact, since he has come to the City of Belmont crime has been reduced by 40 per cent. There are programs, but society and its citizens have a right to be protected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to people like Mr Alan Rose QC: you should address laws that address the victims of crime and the people who are the objects of those who do not wish to obey the law rather than being creative in the legal system and trying to strike down laws which are dealing with the matters in Western Australia.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11540">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">More than a third of Australian adults&mdash;some 4.7 million people&mdash;now have investments in the share market. Efficient capital markets are central to the government's objective of achieving higher economic growth and facilitating private sector investment, employment generation and wealth creation. Economic growth depends on the investment of the savings of Australians in productive and innovative ways. Efficient, well supervised securities markets are a vital component of our capital markets and are one of the most important vehicles for economic growth. They provide investment opportunities, enable companies to raise capital, act as an efficient price discovery mechanism, and help to channel resources and savings to their most productive uses. Strategies to promote the standing of our securities markets must be adopted in order to achieve the government's foremost objectives of promoting growth, attracting investment to Australia and creating employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Stock Exchange, the ASX, as Australia's leading securities market, plays a central role in the efficient operation of the Australian economy. It provides a marketplace for the trading of the securities of Australia's leading companies. In reflecting the collective information and judgment of investors, the exchange channels investors' capital into its most productive uses. By bringing together parties wishing to buy and sell securities, the exchange facilitates price discovery and reduces transaction costs and settlement risks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The savings of millions of Australians are invested directly or indirectly through the exchange. The privatisation of one-third of Telstra, together with the recent demutualisations of National Mutual Holdings and Colonial Ltd, will add to the overall market capitalisation of the exchange. In addition, the ASX, in its capacity as a market regulator, is the front line regulator of the day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day operations of the market. The ASX is, therefore, an important national asset and a cornerstone of our capital markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ASX is currently organised and governed in a manner that is traditional for stock exchanges. It is a `cooperative' or mutual. Since their origins in coffee shop meetings of stockbrokers in London and Amsterdam four centuries ago, most stock exchanges around the world have come to be structured as mutual organisations of stockbrokers. The exchange is owned and controlled by its members and run on behalf of its members under its own constitution and operating rules. Its members are the brokers who use the exchange to deal in the securities of businesses and governments. They are either corporations or firms that are licensed stockbroking organisations, or individuals who are senior employees or directors of stockbroking organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Only recently has the continuing appropriateness of this structure been challenged. Substantial changes to the commercial and international environments in which stock exchanges operate have obliged exchanges to radically rethink their corporate governance structures. In 1993, the Stockholm Stock Exchange chose to become a limited liability company whose shares are freely traded. Recently, other European exchanges have altered their governance structures in one form or another.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Stock exchanges operate in a dynamic, competitive and rapidly changing environment that is far removed from the circumstances of yesterday. The world financial system has witnessed dramatic changes and exponential growth over recent decades. New technologies have allowed an increasing range of financial services to be supplied across international borders. Recent events in the world's stock markets highlight the increasing international interdependence of those markets.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11541">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Exchanges must continually appraise and, if necessary, adapt their governance structures to meet new demands and competitive pressures. The ASX initiated a review of its governance structure in 1995. That review concluded that the ASX should demutualise and go one step further than any other stock exchange by listing on its own market and having its shares quoted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In October 1996, after considering a business case prepared for them, members of the ASX voted to `demutualise' the exchange&mdash;that is, to convert the exchange from a company limited by guarantee to a company limited by shares. That company would be owned and controlled by its shareholders and conducted as a conventional business for the purpose of yielding a return to its owners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ASX is, essentially, a private body. It is not funded by government in the role that it carries out. The government accepts that the internal governance of the exchange is, in the first instance, a matter for the exchange and its owners. The government has agreed in this bill to facilitate the conversion of the exchange to a public company. However, the proposal does raise an important issue for government&mdash;namely, how is it to ensure that the public interest in the proper running of the exchange is protected following the proposed changes to the ASX's governance arrangements?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ASX undertakes three roles within the securities industry. It is a market regulator, a self&hyphen;regulatory organisation or SRO; a commercial entity conducting a public securities market as a business; and a trade association seeking to protect and promote the interests of its members.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The regulatory responsibilities of the ASX</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ASX's listing rules perform an important role in the regulation of listed companies. In making and administering these rules, the ASX occupies a formal, statutorily recognised position in the system of co&hyphen;regulation of companies and securities with the Australian Securities Commission, the ASC. Important services provided by the ASX include the maintenance of market integrity, fair trading systems, guarantees of trade completion, clearing, settlement and transfer systems and information about stock that is traded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The maintenance of market integrity encompasses a number of important facets, including ensuring investors are properly and fully informed about matters affecting listed companies so that their shares can be fairly priced, having trading and settlement systems that are fair and efficient, ensuring that stockbrokers deal fairly and honestly with their clients, and detecting any attempt to mislead the market. Markets characterised by the presence of these elements attract broad investor participation. It is essential that the Australian Stock Exchange continues to ensure the honesty and integrity of the securities market for which it is responsible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The conversion of the exchange to a company limited by shares represents a significant change to the way in which stock exchanges have traditionally been conducted. The issue, from a policy perspective, is whether the commercial pressures of a `for profit' entity will undermine the commitment of resources and capabilities of the exchange to effectively fulfil its regulatory and public interest responsibilities to an appropriate standard. To ensure appropriate levels of investor protection, the Corporations Law will be amended to clarify the responsibilities of the Australian Stock Exchange as an SRO, and ensure there is appropriate accountability of the Australian Stock Exchange to the ASC and the government in carrying out its SRO responsibilities.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11542">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The law will impose obligations on the exchange to do everything necessary to ensure that the market it conducts is an orderly and fair market, and self&hyphen;regulatory functions are carried out on an ongoing basis. It will, in particular, require the exchange to have adequate arrangements for overseeing stockbrokers, for the settlement of transactions and for investigating complaints by investors about business transacted on the market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To ensure appropriate compliance with these obligations, the bill will empower the minister to direct the exchange to attend to certain matters that the minister believes will promote compliance with the ongoing obligations. In addition, the bill will provide for an annual report by the exchange of its performance of its SRO responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Supervision of a listed Australian Stock Exchange</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Stock Exchange proposes that its shares be listed on its own exchange. As the Australian Stock Exchange is responsible for the administration and enforcement of the listing rules against all listed companies, there would be a conflict of interest in the Australian Stock Exchange monitoring its compliance with, and enforcing, its listing rules against itself. To remove the potential for any conflict of interest, the bill provides for the ASC to undertake the supervision of the Australian Stock Exchange's compliance with the listing rules. The Australian Stock Exchange will meet these supervisory costs.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Restrictions on the ownership of shares in the Australian Stock Exchange</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given the critical role it plays in the national economy, it would not be in the public interest for any one party to gain control of the Australian Stock Exchange. The bill thus imposes a statutory limitation of five per cent on individual shareholdings in the Australian Stock Exchange. A limitation of this order will encourage diverse ownership of the Australian Stock Exchange. The five per cent limitation will apply to both Australians and foreigners.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The regulation of stockbrokers</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the current law, stockbrokers must be members of stock exchanges, and stock exchanges must ensure that their members are of good character and conduct themselves accordingly when trading on an exchange. Following demutualisation, the right to trade on the Australian Stock Exchange will be available to appropriately qualified and financially sound organisations, whether or not they are members of the Australian Stock Exchange. Access to the market will be based on a contract between the Australian Stock Exchange and brokers. Those contractual arrangements will not require any ownership interest in the Australian Stock Exchange, as at present. While the bill recognises the Australian Stock Exchange's altered relationship with brokers, at the same time it ensures that the Australian Stock Exchange continues to be responsible for the conduct and integrity of market participants trading on the Australian Stock Exchange and in related activities.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Access to the National Guarantee Fund</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On its conversion to a public company, further approvals of payments from the National Guarantee Fund, the NGF, for the Australian Stock Exchange's own development would not be available. Such approvals, in circumstances where the benefits of the capital investments funded by those moneys would inappropriately accrue to shareholders of the Australian Stock Exchange, will no longer be appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no need to make specific provision for these changed circumstances in this bill. The Corporations Law presently confers a broad discretion on the minister in approving payments out of the National Guarantee Fund for the development of the securities industry.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11543">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Within the scope of this discretion, the government proposes that guidelines be developed detailing the circumstances in which payments from the fund may be approved in light of the ASX's changed circumstances. It is anticipated that payments will continue to be approved for such purposes as investor education and campaign or research projects that will enhance the development of Australia's securities markets, but not for capital development of the exchange.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, the bill provides a mechanism for the conversion of the exchange to a public company. In so doing it gives effect to the decision of members as to the governance arrangements they consider appropriate for the ASX into the next century. Legislation is necessary to effect this change as the Corporations Law does not presently permit a company limited by guarantee to change its status to that of a company limited by shares through administrative procedures, nor facilitate the breaking of the nexus between ownership of a stock exchange and access to the market operated by that exchange.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More importantly, however, legislation is necessary to clarify the responsibilities of a demutualised ASX as a self&hyphen;regulatory organisation, or SRO, and ensure appropriate accountability of the ASX to the ASC and the government in meeting those responsibilities. Where appropriate, the clarification of these responsibilities will have application to securities exchanges generally, and not solely to the ASX.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The measures proposed by this bill will assist the ASX to compete with regional exchanges and enhance the international competitiveness of Australia's financial sector in the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region. They will help to deliver significant new employment, income and wealth to the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill is not expected to have any significant financial impact on government. While additional costs will be incurred by the ASC in supervising the listing of the ASX, the ASX has agreed to reimburse the ASC for these costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In accordance with the corporations agreement between the Commonwealth, the states and the Northern Territory on corporate regulation, the Ministerial Council for Corporations has been consulted and has approved the introduction of the bill into parliament. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill and I commend the bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="S150">Corporations Law Amendment (ASX) Bill 1997</XREF>  proposes to facilitate the decision by the Australian Stock Exchange to demutualise&mdash;that is, to change from a company limited by guarantee to a public company limited by shares&mdash;and to list on its own market. The evolution of this bill goes back to a review in 1995 that the ASX initiated of its own structure. That review concluded that the ASX should demutualise, something which had been done by a number of exchanges internationally, and, in addition, that it should do what no other exchange had done: list its own stock. In October last year, the ASX members&mdash;the stockbrokers&mdash;voted to demutualise. Exchanges in other countries, such as Sweden, have demutualised but none have, apparently, been listed before. So this does represent a groundbreaking decision by the ASX.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ASX presently is a private cooperative or mutual company which performs a number of multiple roles simultaneously. First, it operates a securities market as a business; second, it acts as regulator for listed companies; and, third, it operates as a trade association for its member stockbrokers. The key issue arising from this legislation is: are these roles compromised by the new, demutualised structure?</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11544">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The advice that we have received from the government, from the ASX and from the industry is that the answer to that question is no, the change of structure ought to provide an opportunity to clarify and improve existing arrangements; it should not involve any imprudent risks. Accordingly, the opposition supports this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To ensure adequate levels of investor protection, the Corporations Law is to be amended to ensure that the ASX, and other exchanges, are accountable to the general company regulator, the Australian Securities Commission. Specifically, obligations will be imposed on the ASX, and exchanges generally, to do everything necessary to ensure that the market it conducts is an orderly and fair one, and that self&hyphen;regulatory functions are carried out on an ongoing basis. This should ensure the continued proper operation of the market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, there is no doubt that it is in the commercial interests of the ASX to run an orderly, efficient market. Having a specific profit motive should assist in that motivation to continue to run the market properly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, as the ASX will be listing on its own exchange, there will be a conflict of interest in overseeing itself. Therefore, the ASC will supervise the ASX's compliance with the listing rules. This provision has the agreement of the ASX and is a necessary alteration to accommodate the demutualisation. In addition, the bill will also free up the regulation of stockbrokers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently, stockbrokers must be members of stock exchanges and stock exchanges must ensure the good character and conduct of their members. Following demutualisation, the right to trade will be available to all appropriately qualified and financially sound organisations, whether or not they are members of the ASX. However, the ASX will continue to be responsible for the conduct and integrity of market participants trading on the ASX and in related activities. This is a worthwhile reform freeing up access to the ASX which has the support of the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other major decision in the bill is the limitation of individual holdings to five per cent of the issued capital. This limitation applies to both resident and non-resident shareholders. This is a necessary public interest regulation which will ensure that, although the ASX will be fully commercialised, the national interest lies in preventing a takeover of a cornerstone of Australia's capital markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition is supportive of the legislation. We wish the ASX success in its new structure. We are indebted to ASX representatives for their assistance in explaining some of the relevant issues to us. There are a number of issues concerning market regulation and confidence which ought to be raised in a debate of this kind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I and other members of the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities raised with the Australian Securities Commission aspects of their role in overseeing the ASX and sought their assurance that the changes which were going to occur would not compromise the integrity of the ASX. The committee received the following advice from the head of the ASC, Mr Cameron:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will assume directly only a small additional role&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">the role that I referred to earlier&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and that is to supervise their own listing when that occurs, because they cannot be seen to be the body that gives themselves exemptions from their listing rules and monitors their compliance with the listing rules and so on. So we will do that. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11545">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Cameron went on to express the personal view:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . when the stock exchange becomes a publicly quoted corporation and is no longer directly controlled by the broking industry as such, when it is controlled by investors seeking to make a profit out of the trading on the exchange, then the assumptions that you would otherwise have made about the enforcement of professional standards, the role that the stock exchange ought to perform at the moment and does perform at the moment and will continue to perform, the judgments they make in that will be more difficult. They will have a greater tension between their role of immediately trying to make a profit for their investors, for their owners, and the other role of maintaining the credibility of the market.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He goes on to say&mdash;and I think this is right:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the long term they are not in conflict because long term the credibility of the market is crucial to its long-term profitability. But there is a short-term tension at least between those objectives. I think that will mean that a new regulatory paradigm has to emerge when the exchange is privately owned. That will be a process of time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was the sort of response that we in the committee received from the ASC to questions about the issues involved in this bill. I further make the point that the ASX has noted its in its annual report that funding for the Australian Securities Commission will fall from $104 million in 1996 to $74 million in 1997. Given the importance of the ASC in maintaining that most critical asset of market integrity, it is a matter of some concern to us that the ASC budget has been reduced in this way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, if we are going to talk about the issue of public confidence in the ASX, there is no doubt that it is essential that the public believe that all investors and all those who deal in shares are treated on an equal basis. That is why it was a matter of great public concern that we saw revelations earlier this year on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> program concerning the activities of the Victorian Premier Kennett in apparently telephoning the former chairman of the Australian Stock Exchange, Laurie Cox, to secure shares in the Arthur Yates float.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was a hot float, and members might recall that Stephen Mayne reported on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> program that he had made inquiries on behalf of Premier Kennett as to whether shares in Arthur Yates could be obtained. He reported back that he had made inquiries and had established from the brokers that all the shares were allocated. But, according to Stephen Mayne, Premier Kennett contacted the chairman of the Stock Exchange, Laurie Cox, and emerged with 20,000 Yates shares for his wife Felicity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a matter of considerable public concern if there is the impression that some shareholders, or prospective share owners, are treated differently from others and that brokers apply different rules between clients.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will restrict my comments this morning more to the contents of the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="S150">Corporations Law Amendment (ASX) Bill 1997</XREF>  rather than to the allegations that have been made. They were rather broad ranging, and I remind the honourable member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson) that this is not a court of inquiry; we are here to address certain aspects of the bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Corporations Law Amendment (ASX) Bill 1997 recognises the desire by the Australian Stock Exchange for basic demutualisation. It is yet another demonstration of this government's pro&hyphen;business philosophy. It is indeed indicative of the fact that we are here not only to listen and to respond to the sentiments expressed by the business community but, more importantly, that we are here also to take decisive action&mdash;which is a lot more than can be said for the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11549"> previous government, which had 13 years to do something about this bill and about other areas and which did not consider it necessary to do anything which would enable the business community to respond in a much better way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is what the coalition understands, and again I stress that those on the opposite side failed to adequately grasp that a fundamental key to achieving greater economic growth is to give priority to business. I should hope, even though it has not happened in the past, that in the future all members in this place recognise this, because it is only by helping business to operate more efficiently that wealth can and will be created and that employment is generated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also a member of the Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities, and I particularly welcome the changes that this bill will bring about. The Australian Stock Exchange, Australia's leading securities market, acts as the hub of the securities trading in the Australian economy. The ASX mission statement, on page 2 of the 1996 ASX annual report, has been defined as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To provide for the benefit of all participants, the most internationally competitive and fair market for financial securities and derivatives so as to enhance Australia's position as a regional financial centre.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Australian Stock Exchange is the 10th largest national equities market in the world and the largest in the Southern Hemisphere. It is one of the most technologically sophisticated equities markets in the world. Indeed, the ASX is a credit to our nation&mdash;and it is a shame that some people seem to want to use it as a tool to put their scurrilous allegations around.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The frantic buying and selling atmosphere of the ASX reflects the hectic activity of the industry and the speed at which money changes hands in the new world economy. Because of the fast paced exchanges of information and capital in the 1990s, Australians cannot just look to the past and commend themselves on their successful efforts thus far, but rather we need to look forward and prepare for the next millennium. If we fail to meet the challenges presented to us we will be left behind&mdash;there is no doubt about that. Not only will we be isolated geographically but we will be isolated technologically as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The decision to convert to a public company was not taken lightly. In deliberating over the option to demutualise, the board of the ASX considered the advice of external consultants who responded in the following way. They said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A mutual structure inhibited the flexibility and speed of decision&hyphen;making that was necessary to meet growing competition . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is from page 6 of the same ASX annual report that I referred to earlier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The members of the ASX in October 1996 voted overwhelmingly to demutualise the exchange, that is, to convert the ASX from a company limited by guarantee to a company limited by shares. The Howard government, in giving speedy passage to this bill, ensures that Australia will not be left behind in providing an efficient marketplace for the trading of securities by Australia's leading companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The overwhelming success of the recent Telstra float demonstrates that millions of Australians, from all walks of life, are positively embracing the share market as a real investment option for their hard-earned dollars. Indeed, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator Ian Campbell) alluded to in his second reading speech, more than 4.7 million Australians have investments in the share market. Proceeds of some $14 billion are expected from the sale of one&hyphen;third of Telstra&mdash;I am not quite sure what we have actually got by now&mdash;and 81 per cent of this has been secured into Australian hands. That is good news for Australian families as well as for Australian businesses.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11550">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rollover of private savings into business investment, which facilitates economic growth, requires the implementation of innovative and productive approaches to corporate governance structures. As shown by the demutualisation of the Stockholm exchange in 1993, the conversion of the ASX into a public company will provide the mechanism for enhanced competitiveness of Australian capital markets, both internationally and domestically.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The role of the ASX within the securities industry is threefold. Firstly, it acts as a market regulator. Secondly, it acts as a commercial entity conducting a public securities market as a business. Thirdly, it acts as a trade association protecting and promoting its members' interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under current arrangements the ASX is, in essence, a private body. It is a body which is not funded by government. However, in saying that, this legislation is necessary due to the fact that the Corporations Law does not allow a body such as the ASX to change its status to a public company under current administrative procedures. Moreover, legislation is required to ensure that, although converted, the ASX remains subject to appropriate accountability procedures. To achieve this the government, as well as the Australian Securities Commission, will oversee that the ASX is meeting its responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The demutualisation of the ASX will not diminish its market integrity or fair trading systems. The potential for conflict of interest has been removed with supervision by the Australian Securities Commission. Moreover, given the pivotal role the ASX plays in the nation's economy, the public interest of all Australians has been protected by the five per cent limit on shares available to both domestic and foreign investors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition government, in formulating this bill, consulted with the states and territories and they all agreed upon this legislation. There is no financial impact to this measure. It is not a cost cutting measure, and neither does it have any significant financial impact on government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The  Corporations Law Amendment (ASX) Bill 1997  represents plain good business sense, and we on this side of the House all recognise that it is good business decisions that serve to increase the wealth generating capacity of companies and individuals who in turn provide employment opportunities for Australian people. Job creation is the outcome of that: an outcome that we on this side of the House are taking action to encourage. It is on this positive note that I commend the bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It gives me great pleasure to speak on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="S150">Corporations Law Amendment (ASX) Bill 1997</XREF> . In a nutshell, the bill will facilitate the demutualisation of the Australian Stock Exchange as the ASX changes its status from a mutual company to a publicly listed company limited by shares, with external ownership and operated for profit. The giant leap of faith by members of the ASX to demutualise occurred at a vote of its members in October of last year. That decision was based on business principles.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill attempts to facilitate the proposed changes to the Australian Stock Exchange governance arrangements whilst at the same time ensuring that the role of the Australian Stock Exchange in the regulatory framework is not diminished or impaired at the risk of shareholders, companies and our nation's growing reputation as the key financial player in the South&hyphen;East Asian basin. This will be achieved, principally, in four significant ways. Firstly, it will clarify the responsibilities of the Australian Stock Exchange, as a self&hyphen;regulatory organisation, to ensure appropriate accountability of it to the Australian Securities Commission and the government.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11551">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, it will continue the role of the Australian Securities Commission to supervise Australian Stock Exchange compliance with the listing rules in respect of the ASX's own listing. The Australian Stock Exchange will be listing on a market in which it acts as a self&hyphen;regulator and administrator, hence the arms&hyphen;length provision legislated to ensure the ongoing integrity of the Australian Stock Exchange.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, the bill will recognise the Australian Stock Exchange's altered relationship with brokers, and clarifies that as a corporate entity it will continue to be responsible for the conduct and integrity of market participants in trading on the Stock Exchange and in other activities. Fourthly, it limits individual Australian investors and foreign investors to owning and controlling no more than five per cent of the shares in the Australian Stock Exchange. This five per cent limit, which stands in contrast to the current individual limit on bank ownership of 10 per cent, shows, if nothing else, to the man or woman in the street the principled financial integrity of this bill. That five per cent limit ensures that no significant foreign investment player will obtain a controlling interest in the Australian Stock Exchange.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The figure could, in the eyes of some, seem a little ironic&mdash;especially when the recent Wallis inquiry into the financial sector painted the genuine picture that banks should be allowed to raise their restricted individual ownership levels from 10 per cent to 15 per cent&mdash;but I think it is an important irony and I will quickly explain why. The Australian Stock Exchange is generally perceived to be philosophically opposed to companies having share ownership restrictions&mdash;if for nothing else but to avoid a restriction on the depth of an individual listed company's share register, levels of liquidity or, potentially, stifled share trading. Why the restriction?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The decision to restrict is one instilled by the current government to ensure that financial integrity and confidence in dealing with the Australian capital markets are enshrined. The decision is also about delivering peace of mind to the small, but extremely important, mum and dad investors in large investment houses and corporate share traders. The Australian financial market&mdash;for all its integrity, for all its hordes of commentators, brokers, market analysts, and for all the attention it receives&mdash;is, of course, a minor player in the global marketplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yes, we stand on our own two feet as the ongoing repercussions in parts of the Asian financial sector day by day is proving. But we cannot be seen, in this time of volatile world financial markets in particular, to be providing foreign investment players or overseas corporates with even a sniff that Australia is prepared to put its own market self&hyphen;regulator even remotely in the control of any one, two or three individual corporate entities, be they foreign or local.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill is also about maintaining our A1 financial integrity within the Australian capital markets. It would be fair to say that a fifth key element of the bill, in light of the members of the Australian Stock Exchange who voted overwhelmingly to demutualise, is that it amends the Corporations Law to permit the Australian Stock Exchange to change from a company limited by guarantee to one limited by shares. As the market regulator and overriding key player in Australia's capital markets, the Australian Stock Exchange presently acts as the national exchange for the trading of shares, bonds, notes and debentures of over 1,200 Australian and overseas companies, other entities, government and corporate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of market capitalisation, it ranks 11th in world standing. As of 31 December 1996, its domestic market capitalisation was a quite incredible $392.8 billion. Annual turnover for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11552"> the 1996 year was $185.8 billion, which was undertaken via 4.7 million separate transactions. These figures vindicate the record equities market activity which has occurred on the Australian Stock Exchange over the past year. They are the kinds of figures that would make somebody like Karl Marx turn over in his grave, along with those who have followed in modern history since that abhor the concept of capital markets. They are figures that show that a growing number of Australians are importantly investing in the Stock Exchange and are confident of putting part of their savings into equity investments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, I do not need to remind you of the Telstra float and how successful that was, in particular for the mums and dads of Australia. These are the kinds of figures which have acted as the foundation rock for the recently successful part privatisation of Telstra and its listing on the Australian Stock Exchange. Share investment has become a way of life in the 1990s and this bill is a way of ensuring that the integrity of the market and the integrity of the Australian Stock Exchange in general is kept.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I add that the Australian Stock Exchange, perhaps not as an entity but as the self&hyphen;regulator of the Australian Stock Exchange per se, has achieved an important position in the general public's thinking and investment strategies, I wish to digress towards some wonderful developments occurring in relation to capital markets in the Hunter region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Hunter, to a lot of people, would not be even considered as a potential new growth market for the financial sector. I urge the members of this House to think again. The Stock Exchange of Newcastle is presently in the midst of doing something very visionary for the Hunter and has set in train a new industry with immense employment opportunities for the 21st century. The exchange, which is now in its 60th year of existence, is in the process of completing a review and restructure of its operations to enable it to conduct a stock market&mdash;yes, an individual stock market in the Hunter&mdash;that specialises in the securities of small, medium and regional enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In layman's terms, the exchange is attempting to reactivate the establishing of an electronic trading system within the Hunter to operate a fully&hyphen;fledged alternative equity market. Its moves to do so were the result of the members of the exchange wanting to assist thousands of small to medium enterprises across Australia who are seeking additional equity capital of between $500,000 and $1 million and, of course, more. I might take the time to remind people that one of Australia's most successful companies, Brambles, had its beginnings by listing on the Newcastle Stock Exchange many years ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The stock exchange's vision is being matched by the federal government's general approach to reform of fundraising for businesses, particularly for small to medium enterprises, under the corporate law economic reform program. Similarly, it is a forerunner to what could be expected should the government look favourably on the yet to be released <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Study of a growth equity market for Australia</EMPHASIS>, which was prepared for the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) by the Catalyst Institute. The report will be the end result of an inquiry into the range of problems associated with small to medium enterprises obtaining effective access to effective equity finance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I very much envisage the Stock Exchange of Newcastle's proposal for a vibrant alternative equity market&mdash;upon its approval by the ASC, where, as I understand it, developments are progressing well&mdash;will vindicate the government's thinking that alternative equity markets have a place in Australia, not so much to compete with the Australian Stock Exchange as to carry 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11553"> the excess companies who do not perceive the value of being, or simply cannot be afford to be, on the main board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From day one, since my election to this House, I fervently backed the Stock Exchange of Newcastle's proposal&mdash;a proposal driven by the likes of John Tonkin, Chairman of the exchange, and directors Barry Rees and Stephen Pritchard. There is a reason I have stuck my neck out to do what it takes, to lobby the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, Senator Ian Campbell, on the merits of this proposal, and to put John Moore continually in the picture. If the government is keen to facilitate the development of alternative equity markets, here is a perfect example of what can be achieved both in jobs and in facilitated new investment and immense opportunities linked to this project. That primary reason is jobs, and plenty of new jobs in an exciting new industry sector for the Hunter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">County NatWest Securities, one of the leading financial houses, believes that 2,500 new long&hyphen;term jobs and an upgrading of the skills base of employment across the Hunter are just two very realistic and possible outcomes if the proposed trading facilities of the Newcastle Stock Exchange get the necessary support of my government. That support, of course, comes in the form of the ASC which, under both the existing Corporations Law and the intentions behind the CLERP reforms, must for financial integrity ensure that the Newcastle Stock Exchange stacks up on paper.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the relevant i's are dotted and t's are crossed, I believe that will occur; and Senator Ian Campbell himself is quite excited about the merits of the exchange's ideas. It makes you wonder why neither the former Keating government nor Labor fellow Hunter parliamentarians showed little interest in exploring the depths that fostering alternative equity provisions for small to medium enterprises could achieve for regional economies, let alone for the greater Australian economic picture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In due course, along with my colleague, Hunter based Senator John Tierney, I will be pushing the case for the Stock Exchange of Newcastle to meet the necessary regulatory hurdles to become a part of the government's new industry vision for this nation and for the Hunter. That push will also continue on a financial front, at the appropriate time. I have already had long discussions with the member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson), who is the government's key driver of the Commonwealth's $10 million commitment to the Hunter&mdash;as part of the joint state&hyphen;BHP financial support package&mdash;about the immense merits of the stock exchange's proposals and assistance in funding an electronic trading platform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Such a platform would cost anywhere between $500,000 and $700,000&mdash;which I think produces a very good return on investment for jobs, if we can help foster 2,500 created jobs out of the Newcastle Stock Exchange in the years ahead. My push to secure Commonwealth dollars through that avenue of funding will continue unabashed and unabated. Let us not forget the net loss from BHP at the end of 1999 in Newcastle is that same figure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, if you question my excitable support for the proposal&mdash;which is anything but pie in the sky&mdash;the words of the Newcastle Stock Exchange Chairman, John Tonkin, in a recent press statement, will lay the significance of a proposal down on the table. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is a very exciting initiative, with real upside potential for jobs and investment in the Hunter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Local Hunter Parliamentarian Bob Baldwin, who has been a powerful lobbyist and go&hyphen;between to entice Commonwealth interest in the proposed creation of an operative alternative equity market within the Hunter from day one, along with Senator Tierney, have both overseen the preparation of the submission.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although the Newcastle trading proposal is being considered for approval by the Australian Securities Commission, the Newcastle Stock Exchange itself is not a new idea.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The exchange was first established in 1937 following a meeting of residents and has operated continuously from that date, except for 1940 to 1947 to enable members to enlist for World War II.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">On February 7, 1972, it was incorporated as a company with 13 members and during its heyday had up to 300 listed companies, ranging from local businesses to large national interests, but today the exchange is merely a group of four members trading among each other and through the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) in Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In its submission, the Stock Exchange of Newcastle Limited said it hoped to establish a new and innovative electronic trading system in Newcastle, to help companies raise capital and to allow investors to buy and sell securities in companies which were not catered for under the ASX's listing rules.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The submission said the Newcastle Stock Exchange's rules had been rewritten to reflect current international standards, and predicted at least 25 companies could be listed in the proposed trading system's first six months of operation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">On that note, there are a lot of companies in the Hunter who are just waiting for extra capital but do not have the ability to list on the major boards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By allowing this to operate, by allowing injections of capital, by allowing ventures to go ahead in the Hunter rather than going offshore, we will see those jobs created&mdash;very necessary jobs&mdash;that will bring unemployment in the Hunter region down perhaps to equity with that of the city areas, rather than being maintained at around three to four points higher than the cities.</PARA>

After the very early shutdown days of BHP, it dropped from over 13,000 employees to under 3,000 under the former Labor government&mdash;without a lot of input, without a lot of direction from the former government, whose only attempt to rectify that was the steel plan. And as we heard our great minister yesterday say in the House, and he has said it before, not one cent of the Button steel plan was invested in the Hunter. Not one cent was invested in the Hunter. But those people in the Hunter&mdash;their taxpayer dollars that were put into that steel plan&mdash;did not receive one benefit. The only benefit they have received is the unemployment benefits, as Labor stripped away over 10,000 jobs directly at BHP and many, many thousands more indirectly.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="S150">Corporations Law Amendment (ASX) Bill 1997</XREF>  will bring about the demutualisation of the Australian Stock Exchange, involving conversion from a company limited by a guarantee to a company limited by shares. As a result, the concept of market access will be distinguished from the ownership of the ASX. In facilitating this demutualisation, the bill will also ensure that, in the ASX becoming a public company, its role as an industry regulator is not diminished or undermined.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To achieve this, the bill provides for a number of limitations. Firstly, the responsibilities of the ASX as a self&hyphen;regulatory organisation are clarified. Secondly, the bill provides that the Australian Securities Commission is to supervise the ASX's compliance with its own listing rules. Thirdly, the bill ensures that no&hyphen;one can own or control more than five per cent of the shares in the ASX. Lastly, provision is made for the accountability of the ASX to the Australian Securities Commission and the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ASX is owned, controlled by and run on behalf of its members under its own constitution and operating rules. Its membership is currently composed of the brokers who use the exchange to deal in the securities of businesses and governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From its sometimes turbulent history, three clearly identifiable roles have emerged. It is a market regulator, commonly referred to as a self&hyphen;regulatory organisation; it is a trade association which represents the interests of its members; and it is a commercial entity which operates a public securities market as a business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ASX considers that its central purpose is `to conduct markets in which investors and enterprises come together with confidence to create prosperity through the sharing of risks and rewards'. Accordingly, the ASX has come to play perhaps the pivotal role in Australia's capital markets. Specifically, it is the national exchange for the trading of the shares, notes, bonds and debentures of over 1,200 Australian and overseas companies and other entities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the lead&hyphen;up to its demutualisation, the ASX has had an extraordinarily successful period, particularly over the 1996&hyphen;97 financial year. In that 12-month period, the value of foreign investments in Australian domestic equities rose by 15 per cent to $125 billion in the quarter ending March 1997. Capitalisation of the domestic market increased 27 per cent over the 1996&hyphen;97 financial year to reach a record $444 billion at 30 June, comprising a 22 per cent rise in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11556"> the all&hyphen;ordinaries index to a record level of 2725.9 points and new capital raising of $16.4 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a percentage of Australia's GDP, the value of the ASX domestic market capitalisation reached a record 76 per cent, compared with just over 50 per cent 10 years ago. Turnover on the ASX from 1996&hyphen;97 was also a record, at $212 billion. In the month of June, the average daily turnover exceeded $1 billion for the first time, and peak trading days exceeded $2 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The equities market, which is at the heart of the ASX's operations, was the 10th largest national equities market in the world last year. Equity transactions averaged over 20,000 a day, and the busiest single day saw over 36,000 transactions. The 12-month total was a staggering 5.39 million transactions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On a world scale, according to the Global Securities Consulting Services survey, the ASX ranked in the top three exchanges for operational risk, settlement services and value for money. At the close of the 1996&hyphen;97 financial year, based on the average domestic market capitalisation, Australia had the third largest share market in South&hyphen;East Asia. And to top off this spectacular year, the ASX's all&hyphen;ordinaries and all&hyphen;industrial indexes out&hyphen;performed Japan's Topix and market&hyphen;weighted index for South&hyphen;East Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ASX has not been complacent about its performances over the years. It has sought to further its gains by investing in technological advances, so much so that it is now in a position to offer outstanding service to its customers. Particularly noteworthy is the ASX plan to assist companies, from early 1998, to source informal equity finance on an Internet vehicle called the enterprise market. Basically, the enterprise market operates as a sophisticated financial dating service. Capital seekers, capital providers and venture capital intermediaries can be introduced in the one electronic space, therefore facilitating the development of venture capital as an established asset in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ASX has invested in superior technology systems, such as SEATS 97, the new trading platform for the equities market, and CLICK, an automated trading system to replace floor trading in the derivatives market, which together represent world best practice in trading technology. Yet, despite the exceptional performance of the ASX and its willingness to embrace innovation, it is an institution that is vulnerable to competition, particularly of a global nature.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This vulnerability of stock exchanges was not lost on the six state stock markets which amalgamated to form the ASX in 1987. They realised in the early 1980s that technological advances made them more vulnerable to competition and that an electronic market, which channelled orders from around Australia into one place, would provide the two most vital aspects of a stock exchange&mdash;optimum price discovery and maximised liquidity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This transformation marked the beginning of an increased adaptation to a changing environment. However, we now know that securities markets no longer recognise national boundaries. The mobility of investors and their capital, company listings, corporate structures, skilled labours and, potentially, stock exchanges have created global markets where players can, and do, cross borders in search of better operating conditions and those elusive dollars. Mr Deputy Speaker, you need no better example of that comment than the volatility in stock exchanges and in equity markets around the world in October, where we saw a massive flight to quality. At the end of the day, the Australian Stock Exchange can hold its head high over the way that it handled that volatility.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11557">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ASX faces challenges from other stock exchanges, which are engaged in trying to entice Australian businesses to their shores, as well as from the Internet, which will bring as yet untried share trading possibilities. But share market globalisation works both ways. Just as our ASX will have to watch its back, it will also have new opportunities for creating markets, attracting overseas investors and, importantly, forging regional alliances in the vein of the memorandums of understanding signed with the Jakarta and Surabaya stock exchanges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ASX is well placed to meet the challenges presented by globalised markets head on. It is currently a financially sound institution which, after a decade, has not only a strong, positive cash flow, but net assets of around $158 million. Its markets have developed strongly over the past 10 years. The value of trading grew from a daily average of $264 million in June 1987 to a remarkable $1.14 billion in June 1997. The derivatives market experienced a similar rate of growth, from under three million options contracts in 1986&hyphen;87 to just over 10 million in the 1996&hyphen;97 period. The capitalisation of the equities market rose at a rate faster than the economy as a whole. Equity capital raisings have averaged $15 billion a year over the past five years, with new issues far exceeding new floats.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This decade of growth and diversification in the Australian Stock Exchange has also been distinguished by unprecedented demutualisations of large insurance companies and the privatisation of key government owned institutions. One of the most successful floats has undoubtedly been the recent Telstra IPO, which now boasts 1.8 million shareholders&mdash;so successful that the federal government originally under&hyphen;estimated the total sale value by nearly one&hyphen;half.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At this point, I would like to offer my congratulations to the Minister for Finance and Administration (Mr Fahey) who has done an outstanding job. John Fahey has laid his hands, in a way that can only be described as an outstanding achievement, on the most significant IPO in Australia's history. I would join with this House in congratulating the minister on what has been the most successful IPO in the world this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Privatisation of various government institutions has also resulted in phenomenal share subscriptions, as we recently saw. The Commonwealth Bank now has over 370,000 shareholders, the GIO Australia 100,000, and Qantas 105,000. Shareholdings in demutualised insurance mutuals are just as remarkable. The National Mutual has some 500,000 shareholders and Colonial Mutual 460,000 shareholders. Soon the AMP will be listing with over one million shareholders and a significant number of those shareholders, particularly through demutualisation, are first time investors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Running in tandem with this change in trading focus has been a readjustment in the compilation of consumer shareholders so astounding that today 4.7 million Australians directly own shares, compared to only 1.5 million in 1987. Indeed, the mums and dads of Australia are snapping up blue&hyphen;chip listings like a shark pursuing a school of fish through muddied waters&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DK6">Mr HOCKEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;and I will attribute that to Dave Brockhoff. In addition to large shareholdings in demutualised insurance enterprises and privatised government institutions, the mums and dads of Australia have staked their claims in publicly listed companies such as the National Australia Bank, now with over 240,000 shareholders, Woolworths with 251,000, and BHP with 300,000 shareholders. And of course, it is not insignificant that of the 1.8 million Telstra shareholders, 600,000 or more are first&hyphen;time investors.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11558">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1997 Australian share ownership survey revealed that 20 per cent of Australian adults, approximately 2.2 million Australians, now have direct investments in ASX listed equities. And after the Telstra float, that figure is 2.8 million and it will, of course, be even higher after the demutualisation of the AMP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, the average value of private investors' portfolios has risen from $26,000 in 1994 to $33,000 today. Significantly, these figures are not too dissimilar from those of the United Kingdom and Canada and, of course, the United Kingdom has had the most significant and successful privatisation program in the OECD world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These survey results suggest that private investors directly owned about $86 billion in equities at the end of May 1997. The fact that nearly 40 per cent of the Australian shareholders have a yearly household income of less than $50,000; that nearly one&hyphen;third of all 25&hyphen; to 34&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds own shares; that there has been a significant increase in share ownership amongst women, which is particularly pleasing&mdash;they now constitute almost one&hyphen;third of all share investors&mdash;and that the dominance of older people in the share market has declined, flies in the face of the old&hyphen;time perception that the stock market is merely a playground for the rich. On the contrary, these figures suggest the dawning of a new age in share market ownership. The Australian public has flocked to the floating of enterprises which have stood the test of time, weathering the good times with the bad.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But there is yet another factor which has impacted on the decision by members of the ASX to demutualise, and that is the effect of trading on the Internet. This takes globalisation of world markets one step further, adding both an air of uncertainty and anticipation to global trading.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In July 1996, it was estimated that Australians represented approximately one million of the 60 million individuals with access to the Internet, making Australia the fourth largest country of Internet users worldwide. If analysts are correct, by 2000 there could be between 500 million and 800 million Internet users worldwide, and over one billion by 2005.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this means for global trading is mind&hyphen;boggling. The concept that Australians will be buying and selling shares from the comfort of their living rooms is very real. And it is into this environment that the ASX plans to forge its future as a demutualised institution, an institution with a proud 126&hyphen;year history which, from its first amalgamation through to its adoption of the latest technology, has proven itself to be adaptable and progressive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In short, it is an institution whose publicly listed shares will be devoured by the Australian public. The decision to demutualise the ASX shows great discernment on the part of its current members. The pressures of increasingly globalised trading, which have brought competition across borders, coupled with the desire of the Australian public to own a piece of established Australian institutions, has meant that a change in direction for the ASX could not have been more timely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This demutualisation is a magnificent opportunity for the strengths of the ASX to be shared among the people of Australia in addition to furthering, in the words of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) `the reputation of Australia's capital markets as among the best in the world'. The demutualised ASX will combine with our stable economy, our low inflation and a government clearly committed to substantial taxation reform to encourage further foreign investment and therefore the creation of even more jobs in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At this point, I would like to offer my very sincere congratulations to the pioneering efforts of the chairman of the ASX, Maurice Newman, to the managing director of the ASX, Mr 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11559"> Richard Humphry, and to the board and to all the members of the Australian Stock Exchange. They have led the Stock Exchange through this very difficult period because they have a vision for the Stock Exchange which means that demutualisation is the first step towards Australia having an even more successful stock exchange in the world markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the  Corporations Law Amendment (ASX) Bill 1997  to the House as an example of yet another great Australian institution ready to meet the challenges of an increasingly globalised economy and the desire of the Australian public to be a part of this future.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to be able to participate in this debate. The Australian share market and the Australian Stock Exchange are very important to the people of Australia. This was indicated most obviously during the recent Telstra float, which was four times oversubscribed when the mums and dads of Australia showed that they wanted to participate in part ownership of a major national company.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The result of the Telstra one&hyphen;third sale will mean that Australia could well become the country in the world which has the largest percentage of share ownership amongst its population. I believe the Labor Party stands condemned for not supporting the one&hyphen;third sale of Telstra, and personally I hope that the coalition goes to the next election seeking a mandate from the people to sell more of this important national company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has always said that it would not sell any more than one&hyphen;third of Telstra without a further mandate from the Australian people. I believe the fact that we will have 1.8 or 1.9 million shareholders in this company indicates that there is a demand there&mdash;four times oversubscribed&mdash;and that it would be appropriate for the government to consider floating more of this important national company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose of the  Corporations Law Amendment (ASX) Bill 1997  is to facilitate the demutualisation of the Australian Stock exchange. This will mean that, like many other Australian companies, it will seek to be a mutual company and that it will become a public company limited by shares with external ownership and operated for profit. The government is not seeking to impose this demutualisation; this is the result of a decision made by the members of the Australian Stock Exchange themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Everyone knows what an important role the Australian Stock Exchange plays in Australia's capital markets. In fact there are three aspects to its role within the securities industry. Firstly, it is a market regulator; secondly, it is a commercial entity conducting a public securities market as a business; and, thirdly, it is a trade association representing the interests of its members. I believe this legislation, when carried, will facilitate the carrying out of the role that the Australian Stock Exchange has performed in Australia over a very large number of years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ASX is the front&hyphen;line operator of the day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day operations of the stock market. In making and administering the listing rules regulating listed companies, it occupies a formal, statutorily recognised position in the system of co&hyphen;regulation of companies and securities with the Australian Securities Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ASX is currently organised and governed in a manner that is traditional for stock exchanges. As I said, this bill seeks to turn it from a mutual company into a public company limited by shares, but in effect it is presently a cooperative owned and controlled by members and run on behalf of its members under its own constitution and operating rules. As has been indicated by other speakers, members are the brokers who use the exchange to deal in the securities of businesses and governments. I believe it was a very forward&hyphen;thinking action by 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11560"> the members of the Australian Stock Exchange to effectively ask the government to bring this legislation into effect so that the Australian Stock Exchange will be well placed to face the challenges of the new millennium.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will facilitate the proposed changes to the ASX's governance arrangements while at the same time ensure that the role of the ASX in the regulatory framework is not diminished or impaired as a result of its conversion to a public company. It is very important that the current overwhelming confidence that the Australian people have in the Australian Stock Exchange is maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This will be achieved in a number of ways. Firstly, the bill clarifies the responsibilities of the ASX as a self-regulatory organisation and ensures appropriate accountability of the ASX to the ASC and the government in carrying out its SRO responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the bill will limit persons and their associates, both Australian and those from overseas, to owning and controlling no more than five per cent of the shares in the ASX. That is very important considering the key role that the ASX currently plays. The five per cent limit can be contrasted with the current individual limit on bank ownership of 10 per cent. That lower percentage shows that the government is very serious about making sure that there is a dispersed share ownership of the Australian Stock Exchange following the passage of this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another important thing that the bill does is provide that the Australian Securities Commission will supervise the compliance by the ASX with the listing rules in respect of its own listing, the listing of the ASX. That is very important, and I know other speakers have highlighted the fact that this is a vital safeguard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also recognises the altered relationship of the ASX with brokers and clarifies the point that the ASX continues to be responsible for the conduct and integrity of market participants in trading on the ASX and in related activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Efficient capital markets are absolutely essential to the government's objective of achieving higher economic growth. Most people in the community would accept that we have done a very good job there. Our predictions of growth are likely to be fulfilled, despite the currency crises which have swept across some of the nations to our north. Efficient capital markets are also essential to our objective of facilitating private sector investment, employment generation and wealth creation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Stock Exchange plays a central role in the efficient operation of the Australian economy. That was why, when this legislation was being looked at, it was absolutely essential to make sure that it was balanced legislation and that the safeguards that are included in the bill were in fact included. The ASX is too important to Australia to risk undermining the essential role it plays and the confidence that people have in it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said earlier, the vital role of the ASX was highlighted by the way it handled the Telstra float. The honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey) was generous in congratulating the Minister for Finance and Administration (Mr Fahey), and I would like to join him in congratulating the minister on what I believe was an absolutely outstanding job. There will be a very large boost to the Australian share market as a result of the Telstra float.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for North Sydney also referred to the coming demutualisation of the AMP Society which will see about another one million shareholders added to the share market. That follows the demutualisation of both the National Mutual life office and the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11561"> Colonial Mutual life office. So this bill which will demutualise the ASX really is very much in line with actions taken by other important national institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australian share ownership is currently at 22 per cent and indirect share ownership at 36 per cent. As I said, after the sale of one&hyphen;third of Telstra and after the demutualisation of the AMP, we will find that Australians will have maybe the highest level of share ownership of any country in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the Labor Party, with respect to most legislation brought into the parliament, usually likes to look back 10, 20 or even 30 years, it is, on this occasion, supporting the bill, and I commend the Labor Party for that. I believe it is vital that parliamentarians join together when legislation has widespread acceptance in the community. The fact that both sides of politics are supporting the bill is an indication of the importance of the bill, and the benefits that it will bring to the Australian Stock Exchange and to the Australian share market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is obvious that having an up&hyphen;to&hyphen;date, well&hyphen;run and efficient stock exchange is essential, particularly when one looks at the recent market correction which took place in this country and when one looks at the diminution in the value of shares in other countries throughout the world. This bill is all about encouraging the ongoing, efficient role of the Australian Stock Exchange for the next century. It is a mature stock exchange. We have a mature market and we are a very mature country. Demutualisation is, I believe, a sign that the Australian Stock Exchange has grown up and it is an important step in facilitating an appropriate role for the ASX in the 21st century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an important piece of legislation because it will ensure that there is a more effective and appropriate corporate structure. This will enhance the competitiveness of the Australian Stock Exchange and the Australian capital markets domestically and internationally. It brings into effect the overwhelmingly expressed wishes of the current members of the Australian Stock Exchange, and it brings about something that the ASX needs&mdash;that is, a more flexible corporate structure because of the likelihood of increased competition between the ASX, the SFE, and other emerging Australian exchanges, should some of the Wallis recommendations and other reforms under the government's current corporate law economic reform program be implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some people have wondered whether the ASX, as a public for&hyphen;profit company, can legitimately continue its role of effective surveillance and regulation of the market. In response, it ought to be noted that it will be in the interests of the Australian Stock Exchange to maintain the integrity of the market and the stringent regulation of its listing rules. The market would detect any lapse of standards and this naturally would have an adverse impact concerning investment and listings. I have pointed out that the ASX will not be responsible for the regulation of its own listing, that this will be carried out by the ASC. It is important not only that the right thing be done but also that it be seen to be done. This is a vital provision. The government will also clarify the ASX as a self&hyphen;regulatory organisation in ensuring the honesty and integrity of the securities market for which it is responsible, and will make improvements where necessary to the regulatory framework governing the conduct of public stock markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some people have said that the ASX might use this opportunity to charge higher prices. But it ought to be noted that the ASX is already subject to competition and presently it has the capacity to increase charges for the services it provides. This would continue whether or not it demutualises. In any event, the market will play a very important role in ensuring that costs are kept to a reasonable level because the ASX would certainly not, as a publicly listed </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some people may have said that there are no foreign ownership controls but the government has covered that by pointing out that no individual would be able to own more than 5 per cent of the Australian Stock Exchange as a publicly listed company. This is balanced legislation which prepares the Australian Stock Exchange for the next century. It is legislation which is strongly supported by the current members of the Australian Stock Exchange, and it is legislation that is backed by both sides of the parliament. It is good, sound legislation and I am very pleased that it will be receiving the overwhelming support of this chamber. I commend the bill to the committee.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Evolutionary, as well. The main features of the draft bill are clarifying the responsibilities of the ASX as a self&hyphen;regulatory organisation and ensuring appropriate accountability of the Australian Stock Exchange to the ASC and to the government in carrying out its self&hyphen;regulatory organisational responsibilities; limiting persons and their associates, Australian and foreign, to owning or controlling no more than five per cent of the shares in the Australian Stock Exchange; and providing that the ASC supervises the ASX's compliance with its listing rules in respect of the ASX's own proposed listing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the evolution of this bill, the  Corporations Law Amendment (ASX) Bill 1997  has occurred so that the nexus between the ownership of the Stock Exchange and the access to the share market will be broken. The ownership of the Australian Stock Exchange will be open to anyone who wishes to buy its shares while access to the markets will also be available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The principal reason why Australian Stock Exchange members recommended that the government make amendments to the Corporations Law Amendment (ASX) Bill 1997  was because the financial market and the global environment that we are in have changed quite significantly and have brought new challenges to the Australian Stock Exchange. There have been structural changes, particularly with the globalisation of financial markets and cross&hyphen;border competition of listing, trading and competition within Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the principal reasons why it needs to be demutualised is that the Australian Stock Exchange needs funds for further capital expansion. Why? Because of the increasing competition of globalisation and the necessity to have new technology and communication. Likewise, in the past where governments have been barriers of control, they are no longer, particularly when it comes to exchange rates or to the flow of capital, so further assistance is needed to the ASX particularly to raise capital.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Institutional investors can also move money anywhere and cross&hyphen;border activities amount to over $6 trillion. Therefore it is essential that we hold on to our local companies and we need a more flexible approach while attracting foreign companies to have either listings or joint listings on the Australian Stock Exchange.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the advent of new technology, more sophisticated computer hardware and software will be needed to meet the challenges in the future. In the last decade the Australian Stock  Exchange spent over $120 million. The funding for this came from the Securities Institute Development Account, SIDA, and the National Guarantee Fund, NGF.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11563">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, in this new environment of low interest rates and the requirements for higher margin calls and deposits and with the advent of more sophisticated derivatives&mdash;and of course there is added competition now with the Australian Stock Exchange against the SFE&mdash;higher surplus funds will no longer be as available as they have been in the past for expanding new technologies that are necessary to maintain our competitive edge and indeed to increase it, particularly to North Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, the Australian Stock Exchange must generate more of its own funds to replace existing hardware and software systems. The bottom line that was principally behind this key decision to demutualise was to raise further finance. Thus the Corporations Law needed to be amended because the corporations laws at present do not permit a company limited by guarantee to change its structure to a company limited by shares, which is exactly the status for all other companies listed on the Australian Stock Exchange. That came from the ASE research information paper.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members should also understand that the Australian Stock Exchange is the central facilitator for Australian capital markets and provides a vital role in the allocation of savings of Australians to productive capital investment. Clearly this is what was demonstrated recently with the listing of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the other driving forces behind the demutualisation decision was that the Australian Stock Exchange has a very unusual balance sheet and over 80 per cent of the financial assets are in cash. Quite frankly this is not an appropriate structure for the future for this type of organisation as it competes against other global exchanges to attract capital&mdash;although the Australian Stock Exchange has had a tremendous track record to date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly, looking back over the past 10 years, in the market capitalisation of early 1986&hyphen;87 when I worked in the equities market myself, domestic equities were $184 billion. That figure today has gone to over $444 billion in domestic equities or market capitalisation. When you include the overseas equities in 1986&hyphen;87, which was a very small $42 billion, that figure has now gone to $290 billion. In total, we have seen a rise in market capitalisation from the mid&hyphen;1980s from $226 billion to over $734 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is a great credit to the Australian Stock Exchange. An interesting factor, though, is that the actual number of listed companies has decreased from the early 1986&hyphen;87 figure of 1,320 to just under 1,200 today. We have seen huge numbers of mergers and takeovers&mdash;and, obviously, companies that have not complied to ASX have been delisted&mdash;and we have seen a far more transparent and fair regulatory environment, which was very different to the 1980s, where the corporate cowboys were evident wherever you looked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In actual equity raising, there has been a massive increase in equity raising this year of over $16 billion. We have seen record turnovers and record participation of Australians in equity ownership: from 22 per cent, as mentioned by the previous speaker, up to 36 per cent indirectly&mdash;which is very different from where Australia was at 10 or even 15 years ago. At the current rate, we could well surpass the United States, particularly, which has one of the highest equity participation ratios.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is almost certain.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XJ6">Mr ANTHONY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Certainly, with the demutualisation of the AMP, this will happen. The purpose of the bill is to enable the conversion of the Australian Stock Exchange to a public company. The Australian Stock Exchange, as mentioned, is presently a company limited by guarantee and, therefore, the liability of its members is limited to the respective amounts that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11564"> the members undertake to contribute to the property of the company if it is wound up. This really is obsolete in this age. Contrast this with companies limited by shares, with the liability of members being limited to any amount which is unpaid on their shares.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Each member currently in the Australian Stock Exchange has an equal interest in the company; therefore it is termed a mutual organisation. That is why it is being demutualised. This decision was reached on 22 October 1996, where the members of the Australian Stock Exchange voted 540 to 22 to demutualise&mdash;which was quite extraordinary, because they actually had tried to do this a number of times in the past, but were not able to reach the magical 75 per cent of membership approval. Thus the ASX will be converting from a company limited by guarantee to a company limited by shares.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I mentioned before, the Australian Stock Exchange plays a vital role in facilitating the trading of securities in listed companies and performs a regulatory role through the use of its listing rules and its ultimate power to delist a company. Certainly, there have been concerns that the Australian Securities Commission may eventually absorb most of ASX's regulatory functions. We will have to wait and see. Indications are at this stage that most of those functions will remain with the Australian Stock Exchange&mdash;with, of course, the exemption of its own listing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The main provisions in the bill, in proposed sections 766E to 766I, have the effect of prohibiting any person from being entitled to more than five per cent of the voting shares in the Australian Stock Exchange. There has been much debate over why the Australian Stock Exchange has such a low limit, particularly when compared with foreign companies, who are limited at 15 per cent; with banks, at 10 per cent; and indeed with casinos, which have to have regulatory approval to go above five per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe there is very strong justification&mdash;even though it might fly in the face of having an availability to move up to higher holdings in capital markets&mdash;for it to be essential that the ASX has a very broad diversity of ownership so that no particular institution can gain control of the ASX, which is obviously one of the main facilitators for capital in Australia. And it is in the public interest that no individual person gain control of the ASX. So there are very good reasons why the government has decided to limit the level to five per cent, and I am encouraged to see that the opposition also endorses that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other principal reason, of course, is that it becomes more liquid. This is particularly important. We certainly do not want to see foreign companies having any further control, particularly in an environment where it is very competitive amongst the New York Stock Exchange, Tokyo, London, or, of course, the new developing markets in Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other proposed section is 769A to 769D, and they are concerned with the Australian Stock Exchange ensuring that each stock market of the exchange is an orderly and fair market and that there are adequate arrangements for monitoring and enforcing compliance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part of this comes down to the actual administrative and voting structure of the new demutualised stock exchange. There will not be a requirement, as there has been in the past, for decisions to be made where there has to be 75 per cent in favour of a decision. It was very difficult to reach that, because the ownership to date has been by stockbrokers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What will happen now with regard to the decision making ability of the Australian Stock Exchange after demutualisation is that there will be a board that will be principally making those decisions. Those decisions can be made more rapidly and be more relevant to what is happening with public companies today.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11565">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As you look towards the future of the Australian Stock Exchange, it has had a tremendous growth rate. We have managed to obtain enormous amounts of capital internally through a number of public listings such as Telstra. This has seen a rapid increase in share ownership across Australia; we have also seen the demutualisation of other organisations, particularly Colonial, National Mutual and, of course, the big one, AMP, which will be, potentially, quite revolutionary: over another million shareholders could enter the market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By demutualising and becoming more modern, the Australian Stock Exchange will have an ability to raise capital, because it has a limited balance sheet now. Its balance sheet can become more flexible, and decision making can be made more appropriately. We can maintain our competitive edge, but, more importantly, be a beacon to continue to attract foreign listings onto the Australian Stock Exchange to develop new and more sophisticated derivatives markets&mdash;for which the ASX have been leaders, along with the Sydney Futures Exchange&mdash;and, likewise, capitalise on the uncertainty that is happening now to our northern neighbours in South&hyphen;East Asia and also to north Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With a number of scandals that have been happening for many years now in Japan&mdash;one of their largest security houses, Yamaichi, potentially going into liquidation&mdash;with their banking system, there is a great advantage for Australia, for the Australian Securities Exchange, and for financial markets to stake out a much bigger claim in Asia. There is also the benefit of the time zone that we are in and our transparency. The other advantages we have are a very sophisticated IT industry and a transparent financial system and these can be used to the advantage of the Australian Securities Exchange.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I endorse the move to have the Corporations Law Amendment Bill amended to take into account the demutualisation of the Australian Stock Exchange. It has done a terrific job&mdash;so has the chairman, I might add, Maurice Newman&mdash;and I do believe that the next decade will be an exciting decade. We are leading the way for this demutualisation. There have been other exchanges which have not gone to full demutualisation, for example Stockholm, and there are three other exchanges in Europe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a new frontier amongst capital markets, but if we lead the way then there are other markets and other availabilities that we might be able to trade on.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate ASX and also the House for its bipartisan support of this bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I would just like to thank those people who have participated in the debate. As the member for Richmond (Mr Anthony) has said, it has been a bipartisan debate in regard to support for this going ahead with the changes with the Australian Stock Exchange.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a few comments which I would like to make. First of all, the member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson), the only member who spoke from the opposition, quoted some figures in regard to the Australian Stock Exchange annual report, claiming that there have been large falls in the Australian Stock Exchange funding. What I can say to you&mdash;I cannot give you the exact figures&mdash;is that the figures quoted in the Australian Stock Exchange annual report for the Australian securities budget are incorrect. I just want to put that on the record. While there  has been some reduction in the funding of the ASC, it is nowhere near the reduction quoted in the ASX's annual report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is confident that the ASC will be able to make the necessary efficiencies to continue to meet its regulatory functions and responsibilities within the reduced budget. The member for Wills also made comments relating to the issue of public confidence in the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11566"> Australian stock exchange in the context of allegations that different shareholders may be treated differently in the allocation of shares in popular floats.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be inappropriate to discuss specifically the circumstances of particular allegations made today. Those are matters for the ASC as the independent statutory regulator of the markets. Let me say that I think there is a constant theme from some people in the opposition to play personality politics rather than policy politics, and this was a classic example of that here today. It is just personality politics rather than a case of getting on with the debate of the issue at hand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will however make a number of general points in reply. The bill will impose a specific obligation on the Australian Stock Exchange in paragraph 769A(i)(c) to have adequate arrangements for the expulsion, supervision and the disciplining of a member for conduct inconsistent with just and equitable principles in the transaction of business. The bill is also concerned that the co&hyphen;regulatory arrangements of the ASX and the ASC continue to ensure the appropriate regulation of the market and the activities of participants in that market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments proposed to be made to the Corporations Law will impose on the ASX specific obligations to conduct a fair and orderly market. The operations of the ASX and its market will, as of now, be oversighted in the first instance by the ASC under the memorandum of understanding moved by the ASC and the ASX.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The memorandum of understanding deals with three or four points. Firstly, with reference to the membership and the oversight of brokers, this MOU sets out agreed arrangements for promoting cooperation in monitoring, surveillance and enforcement action in relation to ASX members. It details procedures that the ASX will undertake in its surveillance of ASX members, and provides for the referral of serious matters concerning the conduct of ASX members to the ASC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, with regard to market trading and referrals, this MOU provides for the referral of serious matters by the ASX to the ASC. Serious matters include: market manipulation, insider trading, and warehousing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, it deals with the surveillance and monitoring of compliance by listed companies with the disclosure, accounting and corporate governance requirements of the ASX listing rules, and certain parts of the Corporations Law. In the event that the ASC were to have concerns with the operations of the ASX and its market, it would furnish appropriate advice to the minister. The minister will have the power to issue a directive to the ASX requiring it to do specified things that the minister believes will promote compliance by the ASX with the ongoing obligations imposed on it. If the ASX failed to comply with that directive, the ASC may apply to the court for an order that the ASX does so comply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the light of these arrangements&mdash;as a rebuttal to the comments made by the member for Wills in that area&mdash;the government does not thus anticipate any fall in public confidence in the operations of the Australian Stock Exchange, and we are totally confident that these arrangements are satisfactory. Once again I thank all of those people who participated in the debate and I commend the bill to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to make some comments on this important white paper some three months after the document was brought into the parliament with the announcement that this represented the coming of age of our foreign policy. All I can say is that it has taken an awfully long time for its coming before the parliament, although it was, I admit, discussed last week in this committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the outset can I say that the background against which this paper was produced and commissioned was a raft of policy bungles that have upset our neighbours and trading partners, and that such a paper was necessary to try to give some appearance of coherence and direction to our foreign policy. I will just instance some of those policy bungles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Soon after the government came into office we had the abolition of DIFF, the Development Import Finance Facility, which caused great upset to a number of our trading partners in Asia, especially China, Indonesia and the Philippines, particularly through the way it was handled. Then we caused further upset to China by the government's portrayal of the annual Ausmin security talks with the United States last year as a `reinvigoration' of the alliance. China interpreted that as the alliance being directed against it, so souring its relations with Australia and the United States.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there was major concern created in Asian countries by the racist statement to the House last September by the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). Of course, the government was not to blame for that, but it was very much to blame for the fact that it was not until eight months later that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) repudiated, in unambiguous terms, those remarks. The fact that there was that delay caused deep scars in our relationship with Asian countries. In particular, the whole incident has reawakened Asian stereotype thinking about Australia as a white supremacy, racist nation&mdash;a notion of Australia that we had, with much success, been endeavouring to bury over the last 25 years. Nothing this government has done has been more damaging to Australia than its eight months of wilful silence on this most important issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we had the issue in the United Nations last October where we were humiliated by a defeat by Portugal for a seat on the Security Council. Of course, the factors I have just been referring to were not unimportant in that outcome. Then, just a few months ago, we had the appalling incident at the South Pacific finance ministers meeting in Cairns, with the careless handling of an extraordinarily graphic, no holds barred, background briefing on South Pacific nations and their leaders. Its subsequent reporting in the press created a major embarrassment and caused deep offence to our South Pacific neighbours, which was made much worse by  the refusal of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) to apologise. Altogether, this was one of the most gauche episodes in Australian diplomatic history.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11568">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then, in October, we again alienated our South Pacific neighbours at the South Pacific Forum conference in the Cook Islands, at which Australia's uncompromising position on greenhouse gases had us apparently isolated 15 to 1. Not even New Zealand was reported as supporting us. Certainly, the greenhouse gas issue is a difficult issue for Australia, but not just for us. Faced with nations which would be drowned by a couple of metres rise in the sea level, we appeared unsympathetic and self&hyphen;interested. Altogether, our relations with our South Pacific neighbours must now be at about as low an ebb as at any time since Queenslanders were kidnapping South Pacific islanders to work as slaves in their canefields.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, we also have the current issue before the parliament of the Native Title Act, with the appearance of us engaging in action which is a breach of our own Racial Discrimination Act in taking a racist position, an action which is being noted overseas and again embarrassing us on the international scene.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A good indication of how Australia stands in international circles was provided by the recent comments of a leading international figure&mdash;himself an Australian, born and bred&mdash;Jim Wolfensohn, the President of the World Bank. He praised Australia for its reaching out to Asia through its leadership in APEC, the ASEAN consultative group and the work we did in Cambodia&mdash;all, of course, Labor initiatives. But then he went on to express his concerns about Australia's current leadership and whether it had the courage and belief to lead Australia to take advantage of the great opportunities provided by its geography and innate capacities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the context in which the white paper has to be seen, a context of extraordinary blunders and serious policy mistakes and the international perception of a government that is unsure about Asia and lacking in courage and belief to be fully involved with it. This white paper is clearly an attempt to put some coherence and substance into what had become a policy shambles. The best one can say for it is that it was sorely needed, but it will require much more than this pedestrian document to restore Australia's international standing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The document is called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">In the national interest: Australia's foreign and trade policy</EMPHASIS> which begs the question: what is the national interest? The document answers that question in this way. On page (iii), it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Preparing for the future is a not matter of grand constructs. It is about the hard&hyphen;headed pursuit of the interests which lie at the core of foreign and trade policy: the security of the Australian nation and the jobs and standard of living of the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was a definition of the security of the national interests. There is no argument that ensuring national security and enhancing employment and living standards should be key objectives for our foreign affairs and trade policy. However, the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) went so far as to say that this was the jobs foreign and trade policy. If he wants to call it the jobs policy and have it measured on that basis, he has got an appalling problem, because the jobs record of this government, compared with that of the previous government, is quite appalling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps more importantly in this context, in the definition of the national interests, it seems extraordinarily insular to say that these factors of national security, employment and living standards are the only factors that comprise our national interests. What about our obligations to be a good international citizen? To be concerned about such matters as world health problems, world environmental problems, the international drug trade, the poverty of three  billion people living on $2 per day or less, the need to promote human rights around the world, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11569"> the need to promote the rights of women, children, indigenous populations et cetera: are these not matters that concern the national interest?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly, the narrow and, one could say, selfish approach of the white paper forms an interesting contrast with the policy declarations of the previous Labor government, which were spelt out in very substantial terms in the book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia's Foreign Relations</EMPHASIS> by the previous Foreign Minister Mr Gareth Evans and Mr Bruce Grant, in which the third leg of being a good international citizen was given great prominence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also makes an interesting comparison to look at the new Labor government in Britain and the way in which it defines its role. They issued a mission statement by Robin Cook, the Foreign Secretary, on 12 May, soon after coming into office. And this is how it read at the start:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Mission of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office is to promote the national interests of the United Kingdom and to contribute to a strong world community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We shall pursue that Mission to secure for Britain four benefits through our policy:</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Then they go on to security and prosperity. Under the heading, `Quality of Life', it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We shall work with others to protect the World's environment and to counter the menace of drugs, terrorism and crime;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Under `Mutual Respect' it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We shall work through international forms and bilateral relationships to spread the values of human rights, civil liberties and democracy which we demand for ourselves.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So they put these other issues of being good international citizens right up there, up front with the other issues of security and prosperity for the British people. The contrast with this white paper is quite marked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The paper does go on to discuss some national values briefly, in a low&hyphen;key secondary way, and in that regard it does give a quite unambiguous rejection of racial discrimination and commitment to racial equality, and that was very welcome. Indeed, it should have been said straight after the speech of the member for Oxley in September of last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apart from racial equality, no other human right is specifically mentioned. The paper heavily emphasises the need for a pragmatic approach to promoting human rights. Perhaps we are seeing what this pragmatic approach means in operation in China where, after we had alienated China, as I mentioned earlier, we then sought to get back into China's good books by refusing to support a resolution condemning China's human rights abuses at the UN human rights convention earlier this year, a resolution traditionally supported by Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the Prime Minister visited China, discussion on human rights was hived off for secret talks between officials. As far as I am aware, there is no public indication of the nature and extent of those discussions, except for a report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 28 August of this year, in an article by Paul Monk headed, `Beijing's deadly secrets'. In talking about these secret discussions, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the dialogue is to be secret, it is hard to know what its terms of reference are to be. We may gather something of its character, however, from the fact that the Chinese Government has announced that political prisoners are not under discussion, because of course, "China does not have any political prisoners". 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11570">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">If that is an indication of the nature of these discussions, we cannot expect too much to be coming from them. In other words, it would be a very pragmatic approach to human rights indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the economy, the white paper places great stress on the importance of opening up our economy to international markets and to economic integration with Asia, and it is absolutely right to do that. The Minister for Foreign Affairs correctly points to the extraordinary development in our economic links with the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region in the last 15 years or so, but he fails to say that this has happened mostly as a result of the previous Labor government's initiatives. I refer to such things as the development of a much more competitive economy; the major reductions in tariffs set in place under Labor; the establishment of APEC, which was a Labor idea; the APEC leaders conference, which was the idea of Prime Minister Paul Keating; and the Bogor declaration, which Labor was instrumental in initiating and which sets the scene for further tariff reductions throughout the region. All of these initiatives endorsed by the white paper are very much Labor initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The white paper essentially commits to processes started by Labor: the continuance of APEC and the pursuance of the Bogor declaration to bring that to fruition. It notes that Australia has already reduced tariffs and other barriers more than most other APEC member countries&mdash;something which Labor put in place. As for the future, it states that the government will take account of what other governments are doing in deciding future steps. That is a position that Labor articulated well before the government adopted that policy approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, the white paper's assessment regarding the most profound influences on Australia's foreign and trade policies over the next 15 years refers to globalisation and the continuing economic rise of East Asia. It states on page v at paragraph 17:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's judgment is that economic growth in industrialising East Asia will continue at relatively high levels over the next fifteen years.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That may well be right as a long&hyphen;term judgment, but in the short&hyphen; to medium&hyphen;term it appears increasingly like a wrong call.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even before the white paper was published, events were occurring in Asia which might have led to some caution, but since then the unfolding array of crashes in currency markets, stock markets, property markets and financial institutions in East Asia have increasingly undermined the white paper's assessment. At least in the short term, for the next one or two years, East Asian growth is certainly going to be considerably reduced by all these aspects. It will vary between the countries, but certainly in Thailand, South Korea and probably Indonesia, growth is going to be drastically reduced, if not put into recession, and certainly growth in other countries will be significantly impaired.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the light of all that, one would have to conclude that this is a potentially very serious development. President Clinton, at the APEC leaders meeting currently occurring in Vancouver said that we now have a global crisis. Given that East Asia accounted for 40 per cent of world economic growth in 1996, a dramatic slowing in the growth of this region&mdash;which now appears certain&mdash;must impact upon the whole world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With 60 per cent of Australia's exports in the region, we must expect that they will be substantially affected, with both reduced volumes and prices. But in addition, we must expect a flood of imports from East Asian countries whose prices will now be much more competitive in Australian dollars. And as their domestic economies languish, there will be great pressure on them to expand exports to obtain some form of economic growth. So for us that means 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11571"> rapidly rising imports, great pressure on our import competing industries and a substantially deteriorating current account.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also means reduced growth. The Treasurer said that it would be barely measurable, but the OECD has already said that the GDP growth reduction for Australia would be about 0.4 per cent in 1998 and that in other countries it would be up to about three&hyphen;quarters of a per cent&mdash;and all that was before South Korea was in the hands of the IMF.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So for the next couple of years&mdash;hopefully no longer than that&mdash;our extensive integration with East Asia is likely to mean that we will wear some substantial economic pain, more so than most other developed Western countries which are not so integrated. It would be a great tragedy, however, if that led us to go back on our commitment to trade liberalisation. This is a short&hyphen;term issue for us. We should not let it distract us from the long&hyphen;term benefits of trade liberalisation. We should keep our eyes on the longer gain, and there will be long&hyphen;term benefits as East Asia gets back on its growth path. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to participate in the debate whereby the committee will note the white paper <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">In the national interest: Australia's foreign and trade policy</EMPHASIS> , published recently by the government. It is a visionary document and a document which should enjoy bipartisan support. Foreign policy in Australia has been a bipartisan matter, largely, and it is rather sad to see the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) descending into a party political debate on what really ought to be a bipartisan approach to our national and foreign policy white paper.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0V5">Mr SLIPPER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unfortunately, the honourable member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith is not always known for that. However, he did point out that there was evidence of foreign policy fatigue during Labor's last months in government. It is obvious that was one of the reasons why the Labor Party was cast from office in March last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Returning to this particular white paper on foreign and trade policy, it gives that policy a very sharp focus and it represents a coming of age of Australian foreign policy. I believe it is very important to recognise the white paper stresses that Australia's national interest will drive our approach in foreign and trade policy. In other words, we will make no apology whatsoever in international fora and elsewhere for standing up for what we believe is in the interest of this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe the courageous stand taken by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in relation to greenhouse emissions is another indication that this government is prepared to stand up and be counted for Australian jobs. The government's approach to greenhouse, particularly given the statement made by the Prime Minister last week, is fair and balanced and reasonable, and I believe that all of us ought to support it 100 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our approach to foreign and trade policy will aim to improve the security, the jobs and the standard of living of all Australians. It will do this in a number of ways. Firstly, there is a clear 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11572"> recognition that Australia has global interests which require an active trade and foreign policy of broad scope. We believe that since we are in the Asia-Pacific region the Asia-Pacific region should be our first and highest priority, although not our only priority. The white paper is a public declaration, in effect, of our commitment to the Asia-Pacific region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is vital to realise that our policy may be Asia first but it is not Asia only. Australia does have interests in other parts of the world and the white paper recognises that our interests are not limited to any one region, although it stresses the very important role that our relationship with the Asia-Pacific region will play in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say that there is a great misconception in the Australian community over the benefits of trade liberalisation. Many people say to me that the reduction in tariffs means that we are costing Australian their jobs and that we are casting Australian families out of the work force. I believe that view is quite inappropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am heartened by the bipartisan approach, largely, to trade liberalisation that exists between this government and its predecessor. It is always important to recognise that trade liberalisation has very many benefits for the Australian economy and for Australians. As a country which exports many products, we benefit more from trade liberalisation than some other countries do. Unfortunately, it must be noted that there are some short-term adjustment costs but even conservative estimates point out that the average Australian family has gained $1,000 per year from tariff reductions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A recent publication pointed out that families now have access to a wider range of affordable and high quality products, that imported cars would cost 25 per cent more if the 1988 tariffs still applied&mdash;which is an extra $5,000 to $20,000 a car&mdash;and that clothing and footwear would cost around 14 per cent more, which is an extra $300 or so, per year, for the average family to maintain its dress standards. It also pointed out that falls in trade barriers have contributed to a stronger industrial base, higher productivity, better access to international markets and new technologies and more competitive manufactured and services exports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While unfortunately some factories have closed, improved processing by other manufacturers, education, tourism and other services have produced good news. As other countries join us in trade liberalisation, there will be increased opportunities for Australian products and, as a result, we will create Australian jobs and our economy will be boosted. This is a policy that the former Labor government and this government have both supported.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We ought not resile from the fact that we are in favour of trade liberalisation. The pauses in the areas of the motor vehicle and textile, clothing and footwear indistries that have occurred will create some increased investment but the overall policy is that tariffs should, must and will reduce because it is in the interests of Australia that this should happen. The former Labor government, to an extent, was sidetracked into indulging too much in multilateral international arrangements. We are certainly not opposed to multilateral arrangements but we believe there are very great advantages to Australia through bilateral arrangements whereby we are able to come to individual arrangements with individual countries to make decisions which are in Australia's national interests. In supporting the principle of bilateral relationships, we are not undermining the necessity for Australia to take its role in multilateral fora but the balance has changed with the change in government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The focus of our bilateral trade and investment efforts is very much on tailored and customised strategies. This means that different markets will need different levels of government support for Australian exporting and investors. I believe this is a very important 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11573"> change. Although the foreign policy of Australia does not automatically change with an alteration in government, and it has been largely bipartisan, this new emphasis on the importance of bilateral strategies is certainly an improvement which will work to Australia's interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the next 15 years, our bilateral strategies will emphasise domestic regulatory elements and services. This will require Australia's trade negotiators to have a greater specialisation and expertise in areas such as barriers to services trade, intellectual property, investment impediments and anticompetitive behaviour by firms. This focus will be critical for Australia to capture its share of the high value&hyphen;added activity in the international chain of production. We saw the Prime Minister play a key role in the recent APEC forum, and bilateral and regional fora will continue to provide means for pursuing bilateral objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Gellibrand mentioned certain comments made by the honourable member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) in September 1996. I place on record my very grave concern at the impact that the comments made by the honourable member for Oxley are having in relation to our trade with South&hyphen;East Asia. I have been to South&hyphen;East Asia on a number of occasions and I have seen newspapers report those comments in a way that indicates that this nation is racist. I think most people in the chamber and most Australians would agree that we are one of the most tolerant countries in the world. The newspapers abroad, I believe, have done the wrong thing in so far as they have claimed that we are biased against people on the basis of race. That is clearly not the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The simple fact of the matter is that newspapers in South&hyphen;East Asia are read by people in the same way as newspapers here. The net result is that there could be some adverse impact on our exports to Asia. That would be tragic because Australia is very well located to export many things to South&hyphen;East Asia, particular primary products, and the government's supermarket to Asia program is outstanding. We export an enormous percentage of Singapore's consumption of dairy products. One can go to many of the stores in Singapore and see Australian products everywhere on the shelves.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Returning to this white paper, it is a very forward thinking document. It is a statement of commitment to the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region. I believe that it will be supported by the Australian people and, ultimately, by the Labor Party as well. Happily, foreign policy is largely a matter of bipartisan approach by both parties in the parliament. It is absolutely essential that we recognise we are all about Asia first, but not Asia only. This country will benefit greatly as it seeks to work as part of the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region, but there are also opportunities in other parts of the world. The white paper certainly recognises that those opportunities are there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to congratulate the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) and the Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer) on producing such a forward thinking document. The government ought to be commended for stating where we stand so clearly and so unequivocally.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I listened to the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Slipper). I think most people would agree that we would want a bipartisan approach on many foreign affairs issues, but that does not mean that we have to blindly follow everything that the government does. We are a different political party. We do take a different point of view on many issues. Where we can, we are happy to extend that bipartisanship in so many areas. Of course, we have the right as well to put an independent point of view on foreign policy where we see it as being appropriate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me at the outset make it clear that I welcome this white paper on Australian foreign and trade policy. I note that the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer), said that the starting point of the paper is that an active foreign and trade policy is crucial to Australia's future security and prosperity. He went on to say that it is crucial because Australia has global interests and, as part of the global economy, its prosperity is tied to its performance as a trading nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I agree entirely with this statement. Australia does have global interests and, for this reason, I am very concerned at the downgrading, cost&hyphen;cutting and also closure of many of our diplomatic missions. I do not believe that in every country there should be an overseas mission or that every post of the overseas mission should be filled by totally Australian based staff. There is an argument for the employment of locally engaged staff, where appropriate; but I cannot understand why, if we have global interests, we are constantly cutting missions throughout the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not represented in much of Africa, as indeed we are not in Latin America. Our posts in Africa are faced with an impossible task of adequately presenting Australia's case with constantly cut resources. For example, the post in Zimbabwe represents eight or nine African countries: it is just an impossible task. The same applies in Latin America. I am not for one moment suggesting that Australia should have a diplomatic mission in every country, but we are far too thin on the ground in far too many parts of the world.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11575">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The closure of the post in Denmark was a mistake and will be seen to be a mistake. I still cannot understand why we do not have a mission in Addis Ababa, the headquarters of the Organisation of African Unity. One parliamentary delegation went to Ethiopia and recommended that we open a mission there. When the report came down, they accepted that recommendation and we opened a mission. It was in operation for 12 months and then it closed. The Canadians walked into the premises and got everything at a very low rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point that I am making about Addis Ababa is that it is the headquarters of the Organisation of African Unity and, if for no other reason than as a contact point or a listening point, I believe that the mission there should be reopened. There was much soul&hyphen;searching and wringing of hands when Australia missed out last year on a position on the United Nations Security Council. Might I suggest that it was our lack of representation in Africa, especially francophone Africa, that contributed in part to our not achieving that position? The largest block of votes in the UN is the African nations. We have got a couple of missions in Africa and not one single post in francophone Africa.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also concerned about the direction Australia is taking with regard to overseas aid, especially in relation to population programs. Australia's aid level today rates as 13th out of 21 in OECD countries. This is a drop from ninth in the previous year, and so Australia's aid ratio is falling. Australia has a responsibility to support the continuation of assistance for family planning programs, especially as part of an overall health strategy. Although the question of human rights is often difficult&mdash;and the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent) appreciates that it is a difficult situation&mdash;I do believe that we gain respect by speaking out on human rights issues. Having said that, it is important that our own human rights situation be beyond reproach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am concerned that, on so many issues, Australia appears to be reneging on the strong commitment we had on these issues. The refusal regarding the human rights clause in the European Community treaty last year was ridiculous. We sent all the wrong messages about human rights and reinforced all the wrong prejudices that other countries have about us, in that we are prepared to pontificate, especially on human rights, yet we will not subject ourselves to the scrutiny we demand and expect of others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cutting of funding to international bodies, such as the United Nations agencies, especially in relation to population programs, the cut in our funding to the International Planned Parenthood Federation, and the cuts in the funding to the United Nations Fund on Population and Development are not worthy of Australia. In an overall budgetary context, it did not amount to a lot of money. To the organisations concerned, not only was it a severe cut but, again, it sent all the wrong, negative messages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Fisher said that there should be a bipartisan approach to foreign policy issues. We on this side will not agree to sending all those wrong, negative messages, especially in relation to population issues and many, many other issues, and there is no way that we are going to support the government in what they are doing here. We are going to criticise them and raise the issues constantly so that hopefully in the next budget this funding will be restored.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The same wrong message is being sent to the world regarding greenhouse gas emissions. I do not want to quote the honourable member for Fisher too much, but nevertheless during his speech, which I listened to with great interest, he did say that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) did make a courageous statement on greenhouse gas emissions. The definition of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11576"> `courageous' is open to interpretation. I actually do not think it was a terribly courageous statement&mdash;when you are in a minority, when you are offside with most of the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now, again, greenhouse is a difficult issue and it is difficult for Australia. I represent a coalmining area; I know the issues involved in greenhouse. I am not saying for one moment that it is an easy issue&mdash;it is a difficult issue&mdash;but I do think that the message that we are sending from Australia on greenhouse gas emissions is a wrong message.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister makes much of the fact that he is saving jobs, especially in coal areas such as my own. Yet I have spoken to the miners in my area. Indeed a recent statement by John Maitland from the federation indicates that they do not support the Prime Minister's stand regarding greenhouse. Again, as I said before, we are sending a wrong and very negative message. For a government that wants to create a favourable image, we are certainly not going about it the correct way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I am in areas critical of the government, let me make it clear that in one area I totally support the government and the action, and that is their decision on landmines. I have long opposed these dreadful destructive weapons, and indeed was critical of my side of parliament. I do not think we moved quickly enough on landmines when we were in government. When we were in power, my objection to landmines was equally strong, so I congratulate the government for moving quickly and decisively in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Managing foreign and trade policy is a challenge but governments are elected to meet these challenges. I do not think the government has shown the necessary leadership in this area and I believe that our image as a nation has been diminished by many of the stands that have been taken over recent months in the foreign policy area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to turn briefly to the comments made by the honourable member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) in this debate about this time last week. I do not usually comment&mdash;I am not in the habit of commenting&mdash;on the utterances of the honourable member for Oxley as it only gives them some status. But her comments in this debate were so far over the top that they actually deserve some comment. Much as she may wish, Australia cannot divorce itself from the rest of the world. We live in an interdependent world. We have enough people arguing about internationalist conspiracy theories or pushing internationalist conspiracy theories without members of parliament peddling this trash.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It always fascinates me when people talk about tourists coming to Australia on a foreign plane and on a national carrier and prepaying their accommodation. The member for Oxley quoted this. I personally do not know if the member for Oxley has ever been overseas, but, as good a patriotic Australian as she is, I suspect that, like me, if she went overseas, she would travel on our national carrier, Qantas. I guess she would pay for her fare in Australian dollars, in Australia, to Qantas&mdash;as Japanese tourists often pay and fly on their Japanese line and people from other countries fly on their national lines. When one goes overseas, one often pays for one's accommodation before one goes. I do. Sometimes, people even pay for side trips before they go. When I do that, I pay in Australia in Australian dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not see why people are so concerned if the Japanese&mdash;or the Italians, the Thais or whoever they are&mdash;fly on their national carrier and have prepaid their accommodation. We do it. Maybe they have paid in Thailand or Japan for a trip to the Blue Mountains, but if we want to go from Tokyo to somewhere else we pay in Australia, if we so want, to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a furphy that is pushed, about all these people flying on their national carrier. Why shouldn't they fly on their national carrier? I am always proud to fly Qantas. If I have a choice 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11577"> of what airline I am going to fly on, I always fly Qantas. And, where appropriate, I prepay. You can often get a very good deal by prepaying your accommodation. So I do not know why people keep talking about this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other members have talked about the damage that has been done to Australia's image. I am old enough to remember the image Australia had on the White Australia policy. It took us 30 years after that policy was changed&mdash;and, I will say before people interject, by the side of parliament opposite&mdash;to live that down. So many times when you went to Asia, or to Europe and places like that, people would still raise the White Australia policy with you. We suffered unnecessarily for that for many years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I honestly believe that we are going to suffer from the messages that the honourable member for Oxley is sending out. We are going to suffer for a long time, not only in the image of Australia we are trying to portray, but also from a financial point of view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Oxley made much of jobs&mdash;youth unemployment and loss of jobs in Australia. We all deplore the lack of employment and we all, on both sides, hope that we can make a contribution to restore that. But I would say something in all sincerity to the honourable member for Oxley. While we all can be critical&mdash;no&hyphen;one is saying that the honourable member for Oxley cannot stand up in this parliament and be critical of parliament or of our government and so on; no&hyphen;one argues with that and we are all, on both sides, critical of each other&mdash;the very policies that she is advocating and the messages she is sending out will ensure the loss of jobs in Australia. They will ensure a diminution of the living standard in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why so many of us, on both sides of the parliament, are very critical of the comments of the honourable member for Oxley. What she says is a contradiction. She is just ensuring that what she purports to want for Australia will not be achieved. She is making a significant contribution to that. In that way, she is wrong and she should be criticised for what she is doing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I welcome the fact that the government has put out this policy on foreign affairs and trade. It gives us in this chamber an opportunity to debate it, albeit that two or three months have been spent in the waiting list.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday, in the House, I had the opportunity to follow the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) in a debate on a different matter, and it is coincidence that I follow him today. As usual, his is a very thoughtful and considered contribution, and I thank him for that. I do not agree with everything he said and I will challenge him on a couple of those matters, but I certainly agree with a number of the issues that he has raised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps I should start by mentioning specifically his comments, and also those of the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) who spoke before him, concerning the contribution that we have had from the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). There is no question that if one travels around in Asia, which is an important part of the world for our country these days, Australia's response to the views of the member for Oxley will be raised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have had the opportunity this year to travel quite extensively, both on official delegations and in my capacity of holding office with various friendship groups. I have been to an IPO conference, I have been to Singapore and Malaysia, I have been to Hong Kong and China. Last year, I went to India and Pakistan. In talking to people in those countries, it is regrettable but still a fact that, although in formal exchanges you will not always have the subject of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11578"> views of the member for Oxley raised&mdash;it does happen on occasion&mdash;there is no doubt that in one&hyphen;to&hyphen;one conversations, 99 times out of 100, whether you are talking to MPs, Australian businessmen overseas or local business people, or people in the community, the possibility that Australia might agree in any substantive measure with the views expressed by the member for Oxley is, unfortunately, raised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People raise it in the context: `Is it safe to invest in Australia; is it safe to send my child there to university; is it safe for my family and I to go to Australia for a holiday?' The reality of life is that if people have those concerns, and they do not have those concerns allayed, we will lose some of those people coming here for those various purposes. What that means is that the very things that the member for Oxley complains about&mdash;the loss of jobs and the loss of benefit to this country&mdash;will occur because we will not have the hotels so full, we will not have some investment in business ventures going ahead, and we will not have the education industry so well supported. And that earns us something like $2.8 billion a year; it is a very substantial industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of factors that will determine whether or not people invest here, come here for a holiday or send their children here for university. The reality is that it is raised so frequently in so many countries that you cannot help but feel that there has to be some negative impact. So it seems to me not only that from a moral point of view one might disagree with many of the One Nation comments, but that that party and the member for Oxley have to understand that by her utterances, which are repeated willy&hyphen;nilly, unfortunately, by the media and are often not challenged as they should be, she is actually doing this country&mdash;and by implication, therefore, her constituents&mdash;positive damage. I think that needs to be pointed out on a regular basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to pick up a couple of the other comments from the gentleman from Throsby. He complained about the cost&hyphen;cutting in Foreign Affairs of this government; he talked about the fact that we were closing missions. I have to say that we have not actually closed very many missions. The reality of life is that a lot of it comes down to money, and his government left us a huge debt. You cannot go on racking up debt forever. Sometimes you have to take some hard decisions and you often have to take decisions that you do not like taking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I have to really take him to task in terms of his comments about our representation in Africa, saying that because we had closed posts in Africa we had lost the vote in the United Nations for a position on the Security Council. Frankly, that is absolute nonsense. The reality is that our lack of broad representation across the continent of Africa was something that occurred under the previous government, during their 13 years in office, and anything that we have done has frankly been peripheral and very recent in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason that we did not get a lot of support from African countries in that United Nations vote was very much because we did not have representation&mdash;but we had not had it for years. People reflected in that vote the view that they had built up over a long period of time, not just something that had happened in the last few months. Remember, that vote occurred within the first year or so of our being in government. So, apart from the fact that one might have the view that Mr Butler could not count anyway and would never have made a good politician because he cannot count in things like voting, the reality was that that lack of support was a result of years of our lack of representation there. It is quite inappropriate to suggest that that is something brought on by this particular government.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11579">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we also have to understand&mdash;and it is part of what this white paper is all about&mdash;that you cannot run foreign affairs today the way you necessarily ran it 50 years ago, or 20 years ago, or even 10 years ago. Foreign affairs, like every other field of endeavour, has to change. What the white paper is about is trying to lay down some of the basic tenets. But the way we then operate within those basic tenets will, of course, change from time to time. In business and a whole range of other fields, and also in foreign affairs, we are going to be affected, for example, by technology. We have to recognise that. It is much easier to communicate with another country, to get information. It is much easier for the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) or the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) to fly off to a meeting to fix a problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not necessarily need the huge structures that we had in individual countries in yesteryear for our representation because you could not get the senior politicians there in time to deal with some of those issues. It is an entirely different ball game. For example, one of the trends that is happening&mdash;and I think a very sensible, reasonable trend that is not going to adversely affect our relationships with other countries&mdash;is that we are starting to look at and experiment with the idea of sharing representation in countries. Perhaps Australia, in one country, might represent not only our interests but also those of Canada and maybe New Zealand. In another country, there might be a reciprocal arrangement, where Canada has a post and represents us, and that sort of thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, I went to the IPO conference in Bali a few months ago. During a period when we were not actively engaged in the conference, contrary to the media perception that we might go and lie on the beach, we actually went off and looked at some of our aid projects. We visited our consul&hyphen;general in Bali to have a look at what he was doing. In Bali, he represents Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Britain. He has got a regular job with the tourist trade to Bali from all those countries, unfortunately shipping home bodies, visiting people in gaol, replacing lost passports, dealing with people who have had their money lost or whatever it is&mdash;a whole range of problems that come from having large numbers of tourists in one place. He does a very good job on behalf of Australia and three other countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, if we can develop reciprocal arrangements with some of those countries in other places to do the same sort of thing, we can have quite adequate representation without, in fact, having to say, `Well, we have got to have a post in every country'. But we do not lose the quality of our representation. It seems to me that multilateral representation is quite interesting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was interesting that the gentleman from Throsby specialised in talking about Africa. He has a special interest in Africa. Clearly, the white paper says that we have to focus on areas that are most important to us. It is not just about Asia, which is a critical area, but there are other parts of the world as well. There are parts of Africa which are of interest to us, but one has to be realistic and say that most of the continent of Africa is not at the top of our priority list. It does not mean that it is unimportant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like the gentleman from Throsby, I am obviously concerned about our drop in aid, as I think many of us are. Unfortunately, one has to point out though that, whilst regretting the fact that aid is dropping, it is a trend that has been there for many years. I find it, frankly, somewhat disappointing that the gentleman from Throsby, who is normally, I think, sound on these issues, really wants to make a political point about the drop in aid when, under his government for so many years, that trend was in place as well, as it is with most OECD countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, we are still in the top half, on a percentage basis, of aid givers in the OECD, but it is regrettable, in my view, that we are not able to get that up a bit. It seems to me that, once 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11580"> we get the economy moving in the right direction&mdash;and we have done a number of things in the last 19 or 20 months as a government to do that&mdash;we will have much more wealth, much more disposable income, if you like, and that is when we, hopefully, will be able to start to get the aid going in the right direction. Under the previous government, aid dropped on a regular basis and, therefore, it is nonsense to start to point the finger in this direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, a number of us in this parliament raise these human rights issues on a regular basis in a public way, as does the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister has raised a number of those issues with China, for example, and we have had open publicity about that. He has raised those issues with Indonesia. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has regularly raised those human rights issues, and he does so when he visits a whole range of countries. And there is a place to stand up and publicly raise those issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But equally, it has been demonstrated over the years that just to stand up and make a noise is not always effective with every country. So one of the things this government has tried to do is to adopt a new approach to human rights by saying, `If you like, we will do less head kicking with other countries in public on human rights. We will try to develop our relationships and to raise some of these things in private in the hope that, on a friendly basis, we will start to have a bit more influence in actually achieving something.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are only 18 or 19 months down the track of that new approach, but it seems to me that previously, although we made a lot of noise and there was a lot of rhetoric, we were not always successful in achieving the results we desired. Therefore, it is worth trying a new approach. I think it is too early; I think the jury is still out in terms of whether the new approach has been successful, but after two, three, four or five years we will obviously start to see the results. It seems to me that it is rather fruitless just to condemn a new approach without giving it time to work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I really have to protest at the European Union comment made by the member for Throsby. He argued that we were not prepared to sign off a trade agreement because it had human rights elements linked to it. The reality of life is that not only has that matter been satisfactorily resolved to the satisfaction of Europe as well as to our satisfaction, but that in fact his government took exactly the same position when it was negotiating on exactly the same issue. So the previous government was taking no different an official position from that of the Howard government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am obviously pleased that the member for Throsby acknowledged the support for the position on landmines. This government was also extremely successful with things like the nuclear test ban treaty, which was a major achievement of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The white paper is an important document, and it is important to recognise that it is the first time that the government&mdash;any Australian government&mdash;has laid down its foreign policy thrust. It is important that people understand where we are coming from, what our priorities are and what it is we want to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That does not mean that things will not change or that there may not be change to react to different circumstances as they develop. It is not to say that over a period of time there may not be some variation. But it is very helpful to have a basic understanding of where Australia is going in terms of foreign affairs, and it is very important to understand where we are going on trade policy. Of course we will have differences as time goes by; of course we will have arguments about whether you link trade to human rights and whether you do it openly or quietly.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11581">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that the proof of the pudding is in the eating and, whilst the previous government certainly had its foreign policy successes, this government has had its foreign policy successes. Historically, we have generally followed a bipartisan foreign policy approach and I very much hope that that will continue. It seems to me that there are lot of good things in this paper which the opposition should be able to agree with, and I certainly commend the document to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the 50 years in which Australia has had a distinctive, independent foreign policy&mdash;as the member for Aston (Mr Nugent) said&mdash;this is the first white paper which actually sets out our foreign and trade policy framework. In the evolution of Australia's foreign policy, the white paper is significant for detailing that globalisation and the rise of East Asia are likely to be the two most important influences which will affect Australia as it enters the next century. It also notes that, as the centre of gravity of the world's economy shifts from the Atlantic to the Pacific, Australia's future will lie in a successful integration in Asia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has stated, this does not mean that we have to choose between our history and our geography, but rather that we must recognise that Australia faces a significant national challenge in engaging with our regional neighbours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Paul Keating promoted the idea that he was a modern day Vasco da Gama, a modern day Marco Polo, a man who discovered the east&mdash;which his predecessors had somehow overlooked. During the last election, he promoted the idea that regional leaders would not deal with John Howard as Prime Minister. Subsequently, successful meetings with Prime Minister Mahathir, President Suharto&mdash;on two occasions&mdash;President Jiang Zemin of China and Prime Minister Hashimoto have shown that Asian leaders are comfortable dealing with Prime Minister Howard and that Keating's accusations actually ignore the fact that recognising the importance of the Asia&hyphen;Pacific over the next two decades is not the exclusive preserve of the ALP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The importance of East Asia is not a new notion. As far back as the 1950s, Richard Casey recognised that Australia's relations with the emerging post&hyphen;colonial nations in our region would be important to our future. Initiatives such as the Colombo Plan not only assisted developing countries in Asia but changed Australia through the person to person contact they created between young Australian students and their Asian counterparts. The negotiation of the Australia&hyphen;Japan trade treaty in 1957, the abolition of the White Australia policy under Harold Holt and the recognition of China under Whitlam were all important landmarks in Australia's relations with Asia over the last 50 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The future for Australia in the 21st century is as a confident and open nation that accepts the challenges of competing in the international economy and the challenges of engagement in the region. On a strategic, cultural and economic level, engagement with Asia will be critical and will require foresight and flair to be successful. As the economies of ASEAN and North-East Asia continue to grow, and as the programs of military modernisation update the armed forces of East Asia, Australia will need to work hard to maintain its relative influence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The alternative, a failure to integrate in Asia, a failure to maintain our level of influence as a medium&hyphen;level power, and retreating to a being a protected and insecure country, just does not bear contemplation. Our goal should be to be a nation in the South Pacific with European traditions, but a country that is comfortable dealing with the different  cultures and languages of the Western Pacific rim, and that is able to work in a coalition of shared interests. Our expertise in Asian studies should be expanded, and many young Australians should consider 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11582"> improving their Asian language skills to improve our business and official links with Asia, and also our understanding of Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The white paper clearly rebuts many of the myths which are being propagated by the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) with her dangerous brand of xenophobic protectionism. The white paper shows that over the last 10 years, Australia has become a more open economy. Trade in goods and services has increased from 35 per cent of GDP to 40 per cent of GDP, and over 60 per cent of our exports are now sent to East Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The white paper also demonstrates unequivocally that this increase in exports has created jobs, and that those jobs pay more. Surveys in 1995 and 1996 showed that firms which export are increasing employment faster than non&hyphen;exporters, they are more productive, and they pay better salaries. The paper also shows that since the 1950s, rural commodities have declined as a proportion of our exports as services, manufactures, and non&hyphen;rural commodities became more important. That has become particularly noticeable over the last 15 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As tariff protection has fallen, Australia's elaborately transformed manufactures have increased as firms' competitiveness has increased. For example, cuts in tariffs from 30 per cent in 1987 to around 5 per cent in 1996 have seen medical and scientific equipment increase their exports from $300 million in 1987 to $700 million in 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not just Australia that is reducing its tariffs alone in a protected world. Since 1988, most East Asian nations have reduced their tariffs significantly. ASEAN nations have cut their tariffs on a trade weighted basis by about two&hyphen;thirds between 1988 and 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Professor Peter Drysdale of the ANU has pointed out that 77 per cent of the increase in exports that we have seen over the last 10 years went to East Asia. To quote Professor Drysdale, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia sends more of its growth in its exports to the countries of East Asia than does any other country in the world, including any in East Asia itself.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The recent currency and financial market turmoil which has now affected every country in East Asia has raised questions about the ability of East Asia to continue the stunning growth rates of the 1980s and 1990s. On balance, the opinion seems to be that if these nations are able to correct the weaknesses in their financial systems, maintain political stability, in the medium term manage several leadership transitions, and improve their current account deficits and the high levels of debt, then East Asia is likely to continue its high levels of growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dealing with globalisation and maintaining support for policy reforms will be a significant political challenge for all governments in the next century. World trade and investment are growing much faster than the world economy. The white paper correctly identifies `that trade liberalisation and an open economy contribute to economic growth and job creation', which refutes the common notion that tariff protection actually protects jobs and reducing levels of tariffs actually leads to job losses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much of the growth in international trade has come in the services sector and that will continue. Services comprise about 21 per cent of world trade now and that is projected to rise to 27 per cent by the year 2010. As a consequence, critical comparative advantages for nations in the 21st century will be an openness to new technology, high levels of education and a culture of innovation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In an article in the summer 1997 edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Foreign Policy</EMPHASIS>, Professor Dani Rodrik of Harvard University has tried to make sense of many of the myths that exist about globalisation. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11583"> His thesis is that globalisation can improve a nation's overall national income but that in advanced countries this can sometimes be at the expense of a decline in wages of unskilled workers. Professor Rodrik said that `globalisation does not constrain national autonomy nearly as much as popular discussions assume.' In the paper he also highlights the significant political challenge that results from the process of globalisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Politicians such as Buchanan in the United States, Zhirinovsky in Russia, Le Pen in France and, in Australia, the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) hand in hand with the member for Oxley, show that opposing globalisation, through a brand of neoprotectionism, can gain some political support. It is actually a much more politically challenging task to go out and sell something notional, which is free trade, against something more concrete and tangible but also harmful, which is protectionism. The article does not minimise the significant dislocation that can occur as a result of globalisation. While the benefits of this process are distributed more evenly, those who pay a cost for freer trade are often clearly found.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The policy challenge is to sell, as this paper does, the benefits for Australia in globalisation and also to make sure that education, training and the social security net can minimise the impact for those who do not prosper in a globalised economy. As Rodrik says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">National policymakers must not retreat behind protectionist walls. Protectionism would be of limited help, and it would create its own social tensions. Policymakers ought instead to complement the external strategy of liberalisation with an internal strategy of compensation, training and social insurance for those groups who are most at risk.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Globalisation will continue to be influential with political, social and economic dimensions. Globalisation means that nations will have to account ultimately for poor fiscal and monetary policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the lessons from 1997 must be that, when the firestorm was engulfing the equity markets and the currencies of most Asian economies, Australia was only minimally affected. As Paul Kelly highlighted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 26 November, `Asia's crisis reveals Australia's assets in terms of its economic fundamentals, its sophisticated financial system and its liberalisation of trade credentials.' The Howard government's lead by turning a $10 billion deficit into a budget surplus over three years helped Australia withstand that Asian turmoil.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The budget turnaround was opposed by Labor but without this improvement in our fiscal position not only would interest rates be higher but it is likely that our equity markets and exchange rate would have come under more pressure. Our low inflation, low mortgage interest rates and successful privatisation of Telstra are underpinned by policies that were opposed by the Australian Labor Party. The implementation of the Wallis inquiry recommendations will build on the reputation of our financial system in the key areas of consumer protection and prudential regulation. Australia has moved from Paul Keating's banana republic of 10 years ago to be a beacon in our region for fiscal prudence and financial sophistication.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the section of the paper dealing with regional trade agreements I would like to sound a word of caution. There is nothing wrong with regional trade agreements per se. The closer economic relationship with New Zealand and APEC are both examples of regional agreements that Australia belongs to which do not undermine the World Trade Organisation or global free trade. They do not divert trade. However, customs unions or free trade areas which do not offer liberalisation on a most favoured nation basis, and are not open to entry for other nations, are likely to divert trade and actually undermine the principles of multilateral trade liberalisation.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11584">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that, while bilateral trade agreements may offer a tangible short&hyphen;term gain, the underlying principle for Australia's trade policy must be a commitment to multilateral trade liberalisation under the World Trade Organisation and also a commitment to the concept of open regionalism, which was defined by Ross Garnaut and Peter Drysdale at the ANU as embodied in organisations such as APEC, which do offer liberalisation on a most favoured nation basis to non&hyphen;participants of the regional organisation. The advantage of regional trade agreements may be a more wieldy, more rapid liberalisation, but it is important that they are WTO consistent and do not lead to any sort of trade diversion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the white paper states very clearly and importantly what Australia's priorities will be as we approach the next century. It does offer a framework in a very transparent way to say what Australia will be prioritising in terms of our foreign policy. It is only a framework. It is a framework which we will work within. I commend the paper to the House.</PARA>
