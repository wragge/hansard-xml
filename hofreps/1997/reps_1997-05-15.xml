<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am rising to the dispatch box this morning a little earlier than I anticipated only because we seem to have lost a minister who was supposed to introduce some legislation this morning. But the opposition is always happy to assist those aberrant ministers who cannot get themselves out of bed in the morning to come in and perform their duties on behalf of the government. If it gives us an opportunity to speak perhaps a little longer and have a few more speakers on this Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill 1997, then we are only too happy to continue with that process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill we have before us this morning, which has been the subject of some debate in the last day or so, and certainly a lot of comment both in the media and in the broad constituency that is Australia, relates to the proposition this government is advancing to have a constitutional convention later this year. This bill sets out the mechanism whereby delegates are elected to attend that convention. It sets out the method of voting to elect those delegates who will be attending. It is silent somewhat on the appointment of appointed delegates and who they will be and the process by which those appointments will be made. It also sets out, as I have indicated, the voting system to elect those elected delegates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition has indicated that in the main we will support the passage of this legislation but that we will be seeking some amendments. We do so because we believe that this process is fundamentally flawed. We believe that this is an unnecessary step that has been imposed on this issue. The issue is a vote by the people of Australia on their future&mdash;as to whether or not they believe this country should be a republic.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have said that we would rather have had an indicative plebiscite and ultimately a referendum. We believe that the money that is going to be expended on this little exercise, this flawed exercise, is something which we could have saved, which this government could have saved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But let me say something more pertinent to the background to this legislation and to the whole concept of the republic. I must admit
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3718"> that I have always been a republican. I must admit that ever since I started my association with the political process in this country&mdash;welcome, Minister; nice to see you here, but I will keep going, if you don't mind, for the 20 minutes.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="REITH" NAMEID="WI4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr Reith</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think you are entitled to it.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8I4">Mr MARTIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you very kindly, Leader of the House. I was saying that I have always been a republican and one who believes that Australia should have its own head of state. This was a view I came to very early on in my lifetime. I first started to think about the issues associated with what we were to be as a country, where we were to go and where we could be in the future probably around the time that I started university down here at the ANU. The late 1960s was a period of great change. It was a period when much was happening around us, when much was happening in the world. It was a time when Australia was active in a military sense in South&hyphen;East Asia. It was a time when people started to think about our relationship with what had been formerly the British crown and the United Kingdom. Even the connotation that is placed on `Great Britain' gives us, I think, some inkling as to the sort of relationship that perhaps some people saw as still in place between the `mother country', as it was described&mdash;Great Britain&mdash;and Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we have gone well beyond that. As the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) said yesterday in his contribution, this is not an attack on or a put-down of the present Queen of England. This is not that at all. What this is about, and the personal view that I am expressing&mdash;and one which I am pleased to say our party has adopted&mdash;is that Australia should be a republic, that it should have an Australian as a head of state and that the system of government that we have in this country should continue the way it is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A lot of mythology surrounds what the republic is all about. The view that was put forward by Paul Keating when Prime Minister was open to misrepresentation as it was a minimalist position. It simply said that we wanted to elect an Australian as a head of state. We would remain in the Commonwealth, just as Fiji now wants to go back into
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Commonwealth&mdash;if you can believe some of the newspaper reports emanating out of that country at present. But Fiji is a republic. The way it got there is certainly very different to what is being proposed in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look around the world, those countries which have their own elected heads of state as presidents are part of that Commonwealth and no difference would apply to Australia. What we want on this side of the House, and what I suspect a large number on the other side want as well, is for Australia to have an Australian as head of state, to be part of the Commonwealth, certainly, and to continue the system of government that we presently enjoy. There would be no interference under the model that we have proposed. The system of government would continue. The Australian people would choose the government of this country. The Australian people would choose who, therefore, was going to be in opposition. There is no change proposed in the model that we have put forward, but the model we are debating today, regrettably  reflects the rather confused thinking of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and, of course, his own avowed bias in respect of whether or not Australia should be a republic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think anyone, in seriously looking at the way in which this model has been proposed, would think that it is anything other than as described yesterday by my colleague the member for Banks (Mr Melham) as `a process for constitutional reform based on fear'. I suspect when many of the abnormalities associated with the process of going forward with this bill are put in place, it is going to lead to not a reasonable outcome for most Australians. Let me elaborate on one or two of those particular issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said, the Australian Labor Party would much prefer to have an indicative plebiscite followed by a referendum. We do not think that this particular staged process is required, except of course that it does reflect the Prime Minister's own views. What it does is confuse the whole issue. We think that it could be fairly said that the government, in fact, is rigging the process. We think, when you have a clear understanding and a clear
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3719"> look at this process, that you can come to no other conclusion.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="CADMAN" NAMEID="SD4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SD4">Mr Cadman</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Oh!</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8I4">Mr MARTIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My good friend and colleague the Chief Government Whip is saying that he does not agree that that is the case. I wonder whether you have had the opportunity to have a look at some of the information that came out of the Senate inquiry on this particular matter and at some of the evidence that was presented by people from the Australian Electoral Commission and elsewhere. The process itself of distributing the information to voters in Australia is open to tampering&mdash;there is no question about that. I remember in the last election campaign&mdash;and it has happened before&mdash;certain parts of my own electorate where my campaign committee, having raised its own funds and had material printed, and so on, wanted to distribute it around the electorate. We did so. The cheapest way, as you know, is to use Australia Post, at 7&half;c a letter, to get it out into the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we found was that some of the workers from Australia Post were simply taking the bundles of those `To the householder' letters in high&hyphen;rise unit areas of Wollongong and sticking the whole lot on the top of the letterboxes. That is not what was supposed to happen. They were supposed to go to each individual household and that did not happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The same sort of process, under what is proposed here, could happen in this case. Even more insidious a part of this, and arising out of the evidence which was given to the Senate committee, concerns what you will actually be given and how that process then will unfold. As I understand it from the shadow minister for justice and the shadow Attorney&hyphen;General, there will be an envelope, about the usual size for A4, and contained in that will be two other envelopes in which you send back your votes. There will be the voting paper itself and also some biographical details on each of the candidates seeking election to be part of this convention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know about you, Chief Government Whip, but I suspect that there are going to be a lot of people who put their hand up wanting to be elected to this convention.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Therefore, an envelope that is about yea big will have within it two envelopes to send the ballot paper back, the ballot paper itself and biographical information about each of the candidates. Arranging that in itself is going to be an exercise which I do not think is going to be appropriate in these circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have some real concerns also about the voluntary postal ballot process. We are talking here, are we not, as was suggested yesterday, about not requiring Australians to have a say on their future. What this government is about is saying, `We will give you a voluntary postal ballot. You don't have to be in it. You don't have to have a say.' By logical extension&mdash;and I am not really one for conspiracy theories on this side of the House&mdash;the question has to be asked: is this going to be a testing ground for what some people in the government&mdash;Senator Minchin is a prime example&mdash;would like to see for the future, to get away from the compulsory attendance at a ballot&mdash;not compulsory voting as some people think it is, but compulsory attendance at a ballot&mdash;which is what the law of this country requires?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once you are there, you do not necessarily have to vote. That is not what the law says. It says you have to turn up to vote. I wonder whether this is the first phase of the government's desire to eliminate that as part of the Australian voting system. I wonder whether this is the first phase of a process which will mean that in future the less advantaged in the community&mdash;those people who come from non&hyphen;English speaking backgrounds, for example&mdash;may not, unless you have some compulsory element in this, get out to vote.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, there is one side of politics that would be affected more by that process than the other. I do not think I have to point out in this place who that might be. The material that is going to be distributed as part of this ballot process is only going to be in one language, and that is English. That has to be disadvantageous to quite a number of constituents. Certainly in my electorate it will be. In the electorate that I represent, the city of
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3720"> Wollongong has people from 80 different ethnic nationalities residing in its boundaries.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="FERGUSON" NAMEID="8T4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8T4">Mr Laurie Ferguson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is that all?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8I4">Mr MARTIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My friend the member for Reid probably has 250,000 different ethnic nationalities in his electorate&mdash;I know that that is the case. He would be very concerned, as I am, that the ballot paper is only going to be in English.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing is, who is going to receive that envelope? The Australian Electoral Commission has indicated that two million Australians change their address each year. Since this ballot is going to be held 18 months since the last election and no habitation review is going to be held, it may well be that up to two million people do not get the ballot papers and therefore do not vote.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a very tight window of opportunity when people are going to be asked to vote. It has been estimated by the Australian Electoral Commission that there are something like 200,000 Australians who are going to be overseas and they are not going to be given an opportunity to vote either. They are simply going to be denied a part in this process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to recent opinion polls, it is interesting that something like 72 per cent of Australians support compulsory voting that we have in this country, and I see no reason why we should not do that again on this particular occasion. There is some quibbling on what it might cost to do that. On the best estimates, we are talking about $40 million as against $49 million. If we are going to spend that amount of money on a step that I do not believe is necessary, I do not think the government should be afraid of spending that extra $9 million to make sure there is a compulsory element in this so that there is a genuine representation of people's views.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The voting system itself is also something which is of concern because it has been likened, according to witnesses at the Senate inquiry, to people going along to the local TAB and having a punt on a Saturday afternoon. When questioned about whether or not people in this country would have difficulties voting above or below the line&mdash;the same as for the Senate, but with some subtle vari
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ations&mdash;it was said at the Senate inquiry, `All Australians are punters. They all know how to do it at the TAB.' I do not know if that is right. Having heard the views of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on gambling, I am not sure if he would know how to fill in a TAB ticket on a Saturday afternoon. He might surprise me, but I am not quite sure. So maybe his vote will not count either. I am sure he will get the ballot paper, because he will want to vote a particular way, and I have a pretty fair idea of which way that will be. In yesterday's second reading debate someone likened the process to a bet on the Dapto dogs. It was said that that was insulting. I am not sure which part was; certainly not going to Dapto&mdash;that is not insulting, I have to tell you. But the voting process is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also have some concerns on how delegates are to be appointed. Under the current proposal there is no doubt that the appointment of 40 parliamentary delegates&mdash;20 to be drawn from the Commonwealth parliament, with each state sending three delegates and the territories one each&mdash;will advantage the government parties because of the current political make&hyphen;up of parliaments around Australia. The only saving grace in that&mdash;thank God there is one!&mdash;is that people like Collins in New South Wales and Kennett in Victoria are very pro&hyphen;republic. That is good. At least there are a couple of people's votes that our side of politics can count on among the people who are appointed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We want to see that make&hyphen;up changed&mdash;and we will be moving amendments. We want to see the number of elected delegates increased to 80, to be chosen from the states and territories in a manner which more properly reflects what is happening here. Even Kate Carnell, the Chief Minister of the ACT, said that it was outrageous that her opposite number will not be given an opportunity to come along as part of that convention and to vote. I think Kate happens to be right on this occasion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are suggesting that 16 parliamentary delegates should be appointed from the federal parliament: eight members or senators from the Prime Minister's side, six by the Leader of the Opposition, one by the leader
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3721"> of the Democrats and one to be appointed from the remaining minor party or Independent members or senators. That is quite reasonable in the circumstances. We do not want to see one side advantaged over the other. As was said yesterday by the member for Banks (Mr Melham) in his speech in the second reading debate, we have outlined all these sorts of concerns and the way in which there ought to be a different approach in the balance of people who are going to be here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I want to comment on the necessity of having an independent chair. We have suggested that somebody like Sir Anthony Mason, the former Chief Justice of the High Court, might be appointed as an independent non&hyphen;voting chair. We think that there is some merit in that proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I come back to what I said at the start: if you look at the make&hyphen;up of Australia in the 1990s as we are about to go into the next century, you will see that it has changed dramatically from what it was 100 years ago. Given the make&hyphen;up of people who are here, their backgrounds and the way in which the relationship with the so&hyphen;called mother country has now changed, there is no doubt&mdash;and certainly the polls suggest this&mdash;that the overwhelming majority of Australians would like to see us a republic with an Australian head of state. People have their own views on this and I am quite happy to accept those different points of view. In that hundred years the UK has become very closely integrated into Europe; all the colonies that the UK once had have simply disappeared. Many have become republics in their own right with heads of state selected from their own countries, yet they remain as part of the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of the day it is such a simple proposition that I cannot understand why people want to maintain this God, Queen and country type of attitude. As I say, this is not a reflection on Her Majesty the Queen of England. Some of her successors are a bit of a worry but it is not a reflection on her. And I think that most people accept that that is right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope the government gives some serious consideration to our amendments. It is a
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> process that we think was unnecessary but if it is to happen, and I am sure it will happen shortly, we need to ensure that the people who are taking part in this process reflect fairly and reasonably the outcomes and the views of Australians. That will only happen with compulsory voting, if the voting system is looked at carefully and if the appointed delegates to this convention also reflect more reasonably the composition of Australian society and the parliaments right around this nation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This bill, the Aged Care (Consequential Provisions) Bill 1997, establishes the transitional provisions and consequential amendments to move from the current legislative framework for aged care to the new system under the Aged Care Bill 1997. This bill repeals provisions of the National Health Act 1953 and the Aged or Disabled Persons Care Act 1954 that are no longer required and maintains other sections applying to periods prior to the commencement of the Aged Care Bill 1997. It also contains necessary transitional provisions for a smooth transfer from the old legislation to the new.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, the bill amends relevant legislation of the Departments of Social Security and Veterans' Affairs and others to take account
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3722"> of the new aged care provisions. These are technical amendments only; for example, the bill amends definitions in these acts to reflect the changes embodied in the Aged Care Bill 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In considering these transitional issues, we have adopted an approach that provides security and minimises intrusion into the lives of those persons already receiving aged care. For example, formal agreements between hostel providers and residents concerning entry contributions and fees will be maintained as resident agreements under the Aged Care Bill 1997. This will protect these residents from having to pay any more in entry contributions than they have already paid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Current approvals and classifications will be maintained for existing residents, ensuring that they will not need to go through another approval and classification procedure until those classifications expire. This bill also clarifies a number of exempt status issues for residents receiving these services. For example, existing exempt residents will continue to pay the same exempt fee and will not be income tested.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill ensures that current service providers are not unduly burdened with administrative red tape in moving to the new system. This bill gives providers of aged care certainty in the transition from the old system to the new. For example, approved operators currently providing care, or who have approvals to provide care under the National Health Act 1953 or the Aged or Disabled Persons Care Act 1954 before the commencement of the Aged Care Act 1997, will automatically become approved providers under the Aged Care Bill 1997. This approval will be retained whether or not these organisations are incorporated. This bill specifically allows existing approved operators to choose not to incorporate at the time of transfer to the new system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Aged Care (Consequential Provisions) Bill 1997 also makes provision for applications made under the old legislation that are not finalised at the commencement date of the Aged Care Bill 1997 to be considered under the new bill. For example, applications for approved operator status will be considered as
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> applications for approved provider status under the Aged Care Bill 1997. In addition, sanctions on providers that are now in place remain as sanctions under the new bill. In addition, for Commonwealth funding received by providers up until the commencement day of the new legislation, this legislation will preserve the accountability processes so that this funding can be acquitted after the commencement of the new act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The consequential amendments will also redirect the payment of residential care allowance&mdash;formerly rent assistance&mdash;to providers of residential aged care rather than to residents. This is a technical change only that is designed to simplify administrative arrangements. It will not significantly affect either the amount of income residents are left with after they pay the base fee or the total funding available for providers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill will also amend the National Health Act 1953 in relation to a 1997 budget announcement to increase the number of days of respite that a person in receipt of the domiciliary nursing care benefit is eligible for. This will be an increase from 42 to 63 days of respite per year from July 1998.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While this amendment is not directly linked to the residential aged care reforms, which are the main subject of this bill, it supports greater flexibility in the broader spectrum of aged care services that are available. People who receive the domiciliary nursing care benefit do so because they provide 24 hour a day nursing home level care to their spouse or to another relative. This amendment recognises the dedication of these carers to their family member and is another step towards honouring this government's commitment to carers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are committed to achieving substantial reform in the residential aged care sector. This bill is essential to that reform and is the link between current legislation and the new Aged Care Bill 1997 that will allow this transition to occur.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When he stated that he was not an ardent republican, the member for Calare (Mr Andren), of all the previous speakers, probably came closest to my point. As he indicated, the question of what is essentially a very technical change is rather less important than
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the reality of unemployment in this country. Regardless of these changes, the fact of life is that cutbacks to labour market programs, the reality of an electorate with a high NESB population and interrelated heavy unemployment are far more crucial issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My main focus in this debate is the nature of the process. Two comments put this in context. As an observer at the recent Pakistani elections, the former Prime Minister of Australia, Malcolm Fraser, stated that democracy in Pakistan was under question and was very threatened in the future, despite the massive majority of the new government. There were two essential reasons he gave for that: the continued intervention by the armed forces in Pakistani politics and, more importantly, the very low turnout of about 37 per cent. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian </EMPHASIS>of 5 February 1997 stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Pakistan Muslim League, which has claimed victory, has said it was satisfied with the conduct of the polls. Mr Fraser conceded, however, that the low voter turnout could affect the new government's legitimacy.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What we are seeing is a process that is aimed to discredit itself. The other comment that throws light upon this is from the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) on page 37 of the May 1997 issue of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Adelaide Review</EMPHASIS> . He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Even if republican candidates win two thirds of the vote in the election for delegates (a heroic assumption in the light of the republican movement's inability to sign up more than 6,000 members after six years of media boosting) that still leaves the Convention "do you want a republic?" vote at about 88 to 64, which is hardly a "consensus" or even a particularly overwhelming majority for change.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So what we are seeing, as I say, is a rather tawdry effort to ensure that there is minimal participation, that large numbers of people do not vote, that people are discouraged and find it difficult so that, at the end of this process, after the vote, regardless of the percentage that the republicans or the monarchists poll&mdash;and as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) well realises, the likelihood is that the majority, as indicated in virtually all polls, will plump for change&mdash;they will be able to say that there were problems with the process, ballot papers were lost, there were indications of fraud, there were indications of people interfering
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3724"> with people's ballots, there were collection problems with ballots in certain areas, et cetera. So the essential aim of this process, rather than all this talk about consulting the people and giving them a say, is really to minimise their participation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In retrospect, it seems rather cynical that we had these people saying in opposition that the previous Prime Minister was autocratic in his attempt to change the constitutional process in this country. They continually attempted to assert that he wanted to bypass the people and the parliament and do it in a very despotic and autocratic style. The process they have put before the people of this country is, as I said, essentially about making sure that they do not have a say and, when they do vote, minimising the effectiveness of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most disturbing of these changes is the introduction of a voluntary voting system in this process and, at the same time, the decision that it be by postal vote. This is the linchpin, the opening of the door, for Senator Minchin's determination to change the processes that this country has operated under since 1924. Many speakers have referred to the secret ballot as the Australian ballot. We know, historically, that the nature of the population of this country, the experiences that the people of this country had in the lead&hyphen;up to Federation&mdash;their knowledge of the very undemocratic processes in the United Kingdom before the 1832 Reform Act, of the fact that people did not have secret ballots, that the local landlord controlled the ballots, that England was full of rotten boroughs where families could allocate or sell seats to people&mdash;meant they wanted to do something about it. So they introduced a secret ballot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time, experience in the first two decades persuaded people of all political inclinations&mdash;free traders, protectionists, labour, et cetera&mdash;that there had to be an encouragement of a sense of civic duty and being part of the system for people to feel an identity with it, to feel that they had a role and that government and the political system related to them. So, in 1924, without much debate, they introduced compulsory voting. That came 14 years after Australia's introduction of compulsory registration.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That process has served this country well. Anyone who follows the number of countries that have looked to this country for advice, for help and for structures in regard to electoral systems knows that it has served the country very well. Introducing this measure for the convention is, quite simply, an attempt by the government to give it a try out and to undermine the 72 per cent support in this country for the current system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What voluntary voting is about, if we look at all the surveys in the United States, New Zealand and western Europe, is attempting to make sure that fewer people participate. All of the surveys show that those who do not participate have certain predominant characteristics. Unlike Senator Minchin, I do not think it is as clear&hyphen;cut, in regards to the two political parties in this country, as to who will be advantaged. Increasingly, politics in this country is less class based.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have seen in the US surveys is that it is the transient population of the country, the blacks, who basically tend to be interrelated with social and economic deprivation, young people and the less educated who are the people who do not participate in the US political process. They are the characteristics. It is obviously the thrust of Senator Minchin's determination to make sure that those people are not part of the process, to make sure they do not participate and to make sure they do not have a say.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we talk about compulsory voting, we all realise that the reality, the truth, is that one is not compelled to vote but one is compelled to turn up. Despite all of these claims about how people resent having to be part of it all, it is interesting to note that, when this country and its states moved from voluntary to compulsory voting, the actual increase in the number of people voting informal&mdash;basically making the choice to protest by not voting for any candidates&mdash;was, with the exception of South Australia, extremely minimal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is not evident in the electorate a demand, a push, to get rid of this system. It is essentially partisan driven. It is driven by a belief, on the part of Senator Minchin, that there can be political advantage in this change. It is also interesting to note that,
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3725"> despite all the loyal speeches of those opposite, the ANU's survey of candidates at the last federal election showed that 44 per cent of coalition candidates support the continued presence of compulsory voting in this country. There is no reason to suspect that that poll was unrepresentative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a very grave concern with this process being utilised as a forerunner to a wider introduction of voluntary voting. It is not only a question of the past&mdash;that is a very simple, opportunistic and cynical kind of approach that some people have taken. If we look at the political system in the United States, we can see very good reasons why this voluntary voting system they are putting forward for this election process is wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As other speakers have noted, there is a situation in the United States where Timothy McVeigh and the militias are representative of a wide disquiet in American politics. At the last election, something like 27 per cent of people in the American electorate actually voted for the successful candidate&mdash;I think a little over 50 per cent of the electorate voted at all. People feel marginalised. They feel ignored. They feel that the political parties are not representative of them. They feel that they have no say in the system&mdash;it is big government, unrepresentative government, an establishment, something that does not relate to them. This is the ultimate outcome of the kind of process this government seems to be setting out on the road to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unlike in the period of Roosevelt and even up to the 1960s when they actually made an effort to enrol more people and to get people to participate, what America has created, with the increasing sophistication of political advertising and computers and direct mail, et cetera, is a political process where those who are more likely to vote are those the political parties aim to persuade. They are the people who are targeted. They are the people whose views essentially dominate the political system. It is a self&hyphen;perpetuating process where millions upon millions of people feel that they cannot have a say, that it is not worth having a say and that it is not worth participating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time, we have the situation where the two major political parties are
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> affected by two basic thrusts: firstly, middle&hyphen;class suburbia, with its high potentiality to vote, tends to dominate socioeconomic policies in those parties, and they become increasingly conservative about those issues. Second&mdash;this is a real threat that faces this country&mdash;there are certain special interest groups, whether they are gays, the christian right or the trade unions, which have an ability to mobilise people over and above the general population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What you see in the US political system is not only this appeal to conservative socioeconomic values and the power of suburbia but also&mdash;parallel with that&mdash;the development, internally within the parties, of fringe specialist interest groups which are obviously far more persuasive in that system than they would be in Australia. Here the two political parties essentially have to appeal to a broad spectrum of the electorate. They have to persuade the vast majority of Australians as to their particular attitudes and issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said, we have very grave concerns with the introduction of voluntary voting in this process. We feel that it aims to discredit the process by poor participation. It is interesting to note that people have referred to 1977 and the various referenda then. When people walked in the door to the ballot box that time to vote in the referenda and for the actual elections at the same time, half a million people did not bother participating in those referenda. So one has to put forward the proposition that there is going to be a very poor turnout.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part of this tawdry effort to minimise the Australian people's say and to put power into the hands of the Prime Minister and a small majority within the National and Liberal parties is the reality of a few of the other processes that they are involved in. We know that at the last federal elections approximately 450,000 Australians changed their enrolment in the election period. We know that the current government is attempting to shorten that period&mdash;on the surface, because of supposed fraud in the process. They are attempting to minimise people's right to change enrolment during an election period by reducing the time. In the debate about this
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3726"> matter we have heard it estimated that two million to three million Australians might not get a vote because the ballot papers are going to be posted to the address on the electoral roll.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Locally, last week in my electorate, I had an interchange with a citizen who claims not to have changed his enrolment for six months because no election was due. This man is a businessman and one would have thought that his level of knowledge of our system would have been greater than the average constituent, but it is typical that people do not change their enrolment five minutes after they move house.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I constantly have people coming in my electorate office. They might have lived in the area for a year, six months or whatever, but they have not bothered or have not got around to changing it. Three&hyphen;quarters of them do not know how to do it. They do not know you go down to the post office. So around two to three million Australians will not have the opportunity to participate in this process because they will not be able to go down to the polling booth on the weekend.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters will be considering the liberalisation of the rights of people who are overseas for a number of years to continue to vote in this country, but in this process we see deliberate measures to make sure 200,000&hyphen;odd Australians overseas do not vote. One really has to question why this government is attempting to make sure these people do not participate. Those 200,000&hyphen;odd will not be able to participate because there will not be enough time, effort or opportunity for people in Australia to post the things overseas and get them back again. They will also be denied their right to be part of this system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The facade is about cost. There have been various estimates of between a $35 million and $50 million difference or between a $40 million and $49 million difference as to whether we have a postal voluntary vote or a compulsory attendance ballot. When the Australian people see the kind of expenditure that occurs in a variety of other areas in this country, when they see the government's attempt to basically give tax breaks to people
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> on high incomes with their superannuation and other savings and the kind of loss to the Australian tax system that process brings, they really must question why such a measly, small amount is used to justify the elimination of participation by people in this important convention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there is any person who should tell the Australian electorate how important this decision is&mdash;and I find it difficult to believe that he thinks the change is that fundamental&mdash;it is the current Prime Minister. He has belaboured the point of how important this is to the future of the country. At the monarchist selection meeting at the Sydney Town Hall last week, one of the candidates said that this process was more important than the Second World War against Hitler. So a process that is supposedly so important, so fundamental to our identity, so fundamental to our society is essentially going to be carried out on the basis of minimising people's rights to be part of it because it will cost a few dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition is also concerned about the predominance of appointment in this process&mdash;once again, a deliberate manoeuvre by the Prime Minister to essentially minimise the input, the say, the participation, of the people and to basically monopolise it as far as possible in the hands of politicians. This kind of process goes against the constitutional issue of this country, the fact that he is attempting to ensure that not only do people have minimal say in it but also a majority of the appointees are from his side of politics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The whole attempt of this Prime Minister to minimise the say of the people, to walk over their views, to ignore them, is in sad contrast to the process in Barbados. Barbados has had a longer tie with the United Kingdom&mdash;England, Britain, et cetera&mdash;than Australia has. It is interesting to note in the British papers this week that Barbados is considering its continued connection with the British Crown. There we find a process whereby Richie Hayes, the opposition leader, and Billie Miller, the Deputy Prime Minister, together are talking through that process of how it can change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister is saying that this change is such a great aberration, such a
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3727"> seminal alteration of a situation. It is interesting to note that not only is there a joint approach to how they should move away from the current situation where the Queen is the head of state but also this is going to lead to a process where a significant number of Caribbean countries will go down the same road in the next five to 10 years. In conclusion, the opposition has fundamental objections to a process which, in the pretext of saving the Australian taxpayers' money, is designed to minimise their rights, to minimise their say and, essentially, to ensure a particular result.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with great pleasure that I speak on the Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill not because I approve of its content but because I approve of the outcome that I believe will ultimately flow despite the resistance of this government. The bill in fact reflects a very longstanding anti&hyphen;republican sentiment on the part of those who are in support of the monarchy. One need only look to Australia's history right from its inception to see that that anti&hyphen;republican sentiment has a long, if not an honourable, history.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As McKenna points out in his paper `Tracking the republic', the question of an Australian republic actually began in 1788 when, as McKenna puts it, `Australia was settled by a people who believed firmly that a colonial state was a temporary stage of political development,' and that the final stage would be `independence, separation from the parent state and the declaration of a republic'. So the first settlers very clearly saw that a republic was the necessary outcome of a mature democracy. In many cases, the United States was seen as an example of colonial development and as proof of the inevitable destiny of Australia as a republic, not necessarily in the same form, I might say.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is fair to argue, as McKenna and others do, that from white settlement we have been part of a society undergoing a process of maturation, resisted by some and albeit often slow. There is nothing inevitable about this maturation: it requires effort, it requires foresight and it requires dedication, and we have seen that in the past, from our politicians
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> particularly. It necessitates vigorous and persuasive leadership&mdash;something, I must say, which is sadly lacking in this case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, one of the things that we need to achieve as a mature society, apart from becoming a republic, is reconciliation with our indigenous people. The current debate about native title, the Wik decision and reconciliation shows all too clearly that need for effort, for foresight and for dedication and the necessity too for vigorous and persuasive leadership. Without it, we fall into dissent and disunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite its long history in the Australian political debate, the republican ideal and, indeed, the label republican have often excited extraordinary fear and loathing in the minds of the defenders of privilege and the status quo. Sometimes they also defend the monarchy, but it often seems as if they are more interested in defending the status quo. The sound and fury of rebellion and bloody revolution appear still to reverberate with some when they think about the republic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to draw the attention of the House to an amusing example of early attempts to discredit and scapegoat those who questioned government authority and looked to, for instance, the possibility of a republic. Two incidents in particular illustrate the controversial status of republicanism in colonial New South Wales, and I use these examples to indicate this long history of antipathy, although they do have some humour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">`In 1795 the English republican John Boston, who had allegedly sailed to Australia toasting the King's damnation, discovered that one of his best sows had been shot by marines in a close belonging to Captain Foveaux. Although Boston's aspirations to become a colonial merchant saw him in economic competition with officers of the corps'&mdash;something that many lived to regret&mdash;there is little doubt, as McKenna puts it, `that his republican sympathies contributed to the loss of his sow. At the civil court hearing in 1795, Boston heard Lieutenant McKellar denounce him as a man who had "publicly drank to the murder of his King and the annihilation of the constitution of his country". McKellar also
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3728"> explained that the pig was shot `not in malice or in wantonness' but because it was, amongst other things, destroying the property of Captain Foveaux.' Again, to quote from the court proceedings:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fences or fastenings were no security against the levelling practices of this animal, practices which I conclude are carefully and industriously inculcated in every part of the household of its master.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">`In the eyes of Lieutenant McKellar, the insidious pestilence of republicanism was even capable of converting farm animals into active advocates of subversion.' Although it might not be a pretty image, it is quite likely, as McKenna put it, that Australia's first republican martyr was a pig. That is not to say anything about the contemporary supporters, but it does show that the word `republican' was often used, and is still used, as a means of discrediting those who question government authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another example that I think gives voice to this is again one quoted by McKenna. `In 1806 Joseph Smallsalts, a convict who dared to utter "expressions of inflammatory and seditious practices" by declaring his support for the philosophies of Thomas Paine'&mdash;extraordinarily seditious&mdash;discovered the very harsh penalties awaiting republicans in New South Wales and was actually given 100 lashes and sentenced to hard labour in the Newcastle coalmines. This does not happen to us today, but I think there are some on the other side who would like to see many of us abandoned in this way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">`On the journey north apparently he stood in chains in the back of a wagon, and the authorities had a large label sewn on to the back of his shirt on which were deciphered in large characters `Thomas Paine'. Smallsalts defiantly declared he would be far more dangerous than Thomas Paine if thwarted.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I use these examples to indicate what I think is the sentiment behind this bill. There is a great deal of reluctance. It is very small minded and it still has resonances of this sentiment. The bill is sadly characteristic of the Howard government. It is timid, it is lacking in excitement or vision and it is pretty manipulative and mean in its approach to
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> broad community wishes. Indeed, it is seeking to thwart them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill provides a very sharp contrast I think to the founders of our constitution, who knew they were embarking on the very serious business of constructing a constitution which would have profound repercussions on the future of Australia. We are embarking on the same course now and it should be given the same seriousness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They were also very clear at the time that they were embarking on the people's business. They were not doing it for themselves and for their own short-term political gains. They were not meeting reluctantly to consider an ill thought out promise made at the height of a failed leader's vulnerability, which is what we are debating here unfortunately in this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many will remember that, when the member for Mayo, Alexander Downer, was the Leader of the Opposition, he was in a bit of a pickle and suddenly we had the people's convention. It has transmogrified into this strange beast we see before us, neither elected nor nominated fully.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation is clearly designed to reduce the likelihood of achieving a republic by diminishing the authority of the part elected and part nominated convention. I know there will be people working extremely hard to make sure that is not the case. I myself am a member of the Australian Republican Movement and, in my own area of Fremantle, I spoke recently at a very well attended forum on this matter. So there are people out there working very hard indeed to ensure that this is a people's convention and that it will be taken seriously by the wider community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On our side of politics, we would clearly prefer an unambiguous test of the people's will in an indicative plebiscite, not this partial opinion poll which will be bolstered by a preponderance of conservative coalition delegates, and I hope to illustrate that in a moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The convention is also not a very good means of promoting community discussion. It clearly falls short of consulting the wider community and it leaves it to those groups
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3729"> who have already well&hyphen;formed positions to try to persuade their fellow citizens one way or the other. If the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is serious about wanting community consultation, this is not the way to achieve it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think there is also a measurable risk that the forum will be used for other agendas and other purposes. I am sure many people have in recent days noted the publicity given to the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). She indicated in an interview that her followers would probably&mdash;I think she almost said certainly&mdash;run a ticket for the people's convention. But, interestingly, she refused to say what their view was on the desirability of a republic or of retaining the monarchy. So I think that is a fair indication that this will simply be used as an electoral test for other agendas which have nothing to do with either of those matters. From my own point of view, I think it is inevitable that some members of the far right and their fellow travellers, who will remain nameless, will find the platform irresistible, and I believe that will be very dangerous indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The principal weaknesses in the legislation, apart from these philosophical problems, turn around the question of the method of voting that is to be adopted&mdash;that is, the voluntary postal ballot&mdash;how the ballot will actually be carried out and the selection of community and parliamentary representatives. I think the combined effect of these weaknesses will significantly undermine the credibility of the convention. Indeed, I believe that is the clear intent of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The clear intent is to minimise participation, to reduce the voter turnout and to then be able to claim retrospectively that this shows a lack of community interest, and therefore either that we should not proceed at all or that the matter should be delayed. As many members have already said, the bill provides for a very unwelcome departure from the usual form of voting in federal and state politics: it is voluntary and it is by post.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This method will disempower significant sections of the Australian community, particularly those who are mobile&mdash;and that is a great many&mdash;and those who live in areas remote from the centre of political discussion.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> It is likely they will not even know it is going on. Those whose first language is not English will find it difficult. Those who are illiterate or visually impaired will also have great difficulty in filling out the ballots and, of course, the exclusion of those who live overseas has been commented upon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a significant and deliberate watering down of the idea of a universal vote. It is not a question of cost. We have already heard that the margin between this and a compulsory attendance ballot would be as little as $9 million. It is a critical decision for Australia's future and it should not be hostage to the Prime Minister's peculiar spending priorities&mdash;either it is important or it is not. In any case, I think there is a lot of evidence to suggest that the Electoral Commission and Australia Post may be underestimating the cost of this postal voting system. In Western Australia, they have recently introduced postal voting at local government level and, in some cases, there have been costs of over $3 per elector. Given the number of candidates who will need to be described on these ballot papers, it is unlikely that the usual standard envelope will suffice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is inevitable that the Australian Electoral Commission's final estimate will prove to be an underestimate and I hope that Australia Post are not left to carry the can if their assessment of the cost is wrong. In any case, the critical question is whether or not people should be given an appropriate vote, and a postal ballot falls short on all scores.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also creates a worrying precedent, especially given the government's flirtation with the idea of voluntary voting at ordinary elections. Previous speakers have highlighted some of the problems with this. It has all the hallmarks, to my mind, of a trial run for voluntary voting despite the fact that the majority of Australians have clearly shown that they are in favour of the retention of compulsory attendance at the ballot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will inevitably be a low turnout, for a range of reasons, expected to range from 30 or 40 per cent to 60 or 70 per cent, depending on the constituency. Of course, that will invalidate the deliberations of the convention in the eyes of many, and rightly so. And that
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3730"> is no accident; that is clearly the government's intention. The less validity these deliberations have, as far as they are concerned, the better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other speakers have indicated&mdash;and I think this is important to underline&mdash;that our objection is a matter of principle, since the polls show that voluntary voting would probably benefit republican candidates. But we do not like this precedent; we do not like what it presages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to speak briefly on the voting system and how the ballot will actually be conducted. The selection of postal voting has resulted already in a number of undesirable features being foisted on the voters. Firstly, a very incomplete and confused adoption of the Senate style voting system. I was appalled, when I read the Australian Electoral Commission's submission, at their blithe adoption of the analogy with current betting systems. I, for one, have never set foot inside a TAB, and I am sure there are many others who have not, but it does show how far Kennett's obscene casino culture has penetrated our society when such an august body, and such a usually thoughtful body, should draw such parallels. I must say to the commissioners that I object.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The mechanism, too, is inordinately complicated and clearly disadvantages those who do not want to vote the `ticket' of grouped candidates and who want to vote for individuals. It will mean a great deal of informal voting, there is no doubt about that, or people being forced to not vote at all because they cannot vote the `ticket'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also needs to be said&mdash;although people do not want to hear this because we do have postal voting for some purposes in Australia already&mdash;that postal votes run the risk of being rorted. If you think about the way post is delivered in large complexes with a high turnover of residents, there is every chance that ballots will be picked up by people for whom they are not intended. Preventing that may well result in further informal voting: for instance, requiring people to put their date of birth on the outside of the envelope, which is one thing that has been suggested, or the person who forgets and therefore has an
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> informal vote although it may have been perfectly proper. So there is a very considerable difficulty. And it fails our long&hyphen;cherished requirement for a secret ballot&mdash;the so&hyphen;called `Australian ballot'. It is inevitable that it will be subject to the scrutiny of others&mdash;not in every case but in many cases&mdash;especially given the delay between the delivery and the closure of the polls.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to speak briefly about the appointment of delegates. Although the bill does not specially deal with it, clearly the whole convention depends upon the balance between the elected and the nominated delegates. They will make up half the convention and they will be very influential. First of all, it is clear that there should be a proper balance between the various political parties in this country, and what we have seen here is a breach with precedent so that the conservatives clearly have the upper hand. The representation will be biased in favour of the conservative parties. I must say that I am not sure why there should be any parliamentary representatives. We have our opportunity to vote; we have our opportunity to discuss these matters in these places. Why should there be parliamentary representation? If the Prime Minister is absolutely clear about this being a community consultation process, why have members of parliament?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The community representatives, too, are likely to be chosen because they are known to the political parties, in particular the Prime Minister and his supporters. It is inevitable&mdash;and you have heard this said by some of them&mdash;that they will be prominent citizens, again not necessarily representative of the wider community. Generally speaking, this balance of parliamentarians and selected known and prominent citizens will mean that there is a bias not only in favour of the conservative view but also towards older members of our community. It is almost certain that, if you look at the bias, it will be in favour of the older members and, as Bean, one of our prominent political scientists has indicated, age has the most consistently strong effect on choosing a monarchy. The older the citizen, the more likely they are&mdash;perhaps not surprisingly&mdash;to oppose republicanism. So
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3731"> again it is going to be stacked by pro&hyphen;monarchists, by prominent citizens who will typically be older, and there is no guarantee, despite what the Prime Minister has said, that women will be properly represented; and that is something that I want to touch on a little further.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things that is very interesting about the nomination of these delegates is that the government has clearly failed to notify the community that they could self-nominate and has left it to senior political figures to nominate on their behalf. Again, that hardly smacks of participation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Looking at the question of the involvement of women, I feel very strongly that, since no women participated in the constitutional conventions of 1891, 1897 and 1898, we should remedy this in this current convention and women should be eligible to participate, as they are through voting, through nomination, and it should be an important opportunity for women to participate equally in the constitutional debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That means the government has a particular responsibility through its nominations to ensure the proper representation of women. It should undertake a community education campaign to make sure that women put their names forward. There are some suggestions which are backed by a great many women's organisations that the names of men and women are required to be alternated on group tickets registered with the Electoral Commission, ensuring that we do have equal representation of women in these very important considerations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I want to talk very briefly about the procedures of the convention, which are nowhere referred to in this legislation but which we deserve to be able to discuss. Firstly, who will chair it and how? We certainly recommend there be an independent chair. What will be on the agenda and how will it be fully discussed? I am not aware of this being discussed with anyone in this place. How, for example, will a consensus be reached? How will we know when there has been agreement? What will be required by way of a vote or discussion? Does it mean 100 per cent consensus needs to be reached
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> or will a majority vote do? My suspicion is that anything short of 100 per cent for a republic will see the whole matter put on the backburner for a very long time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude where I started: this bill really resonates with the anti&hyphen;republican sentiment that has been part of the conservative philosophy in this country for a very long time. It need not be. If we were to have a full and open discussion of this, an indicative plebiscite would be the best way to go. This strange beast, this convention, serves no purpose other than to diminish the weight of opinion, which is clearly in favour of a republic.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition has proposed a series of amendments to the Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill 1997 because this legislation as it stands is seriously flawed. This legislation compromises the noble process that the nation should be engaged in at this time as it moves further down the road to full political maturity&mdash;that political maturity being Australia's final statement and expression of its structural political independence: the creation of an Australian republic, a republic led by an Australian.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor courageously put this issue firmly on the national political agenda in the life of the last parliament. We saw this as a unique opportunity for Australians and the nation as a whole, with the move to the new millennium and the staging of the Olympic Games, to take the final step towards political independence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We took that action at considerable political cost. When we did, we acknowledged our unique history and the contribution of the British political system to Australia's political development. When we put this item on the national political agenda, in no way was it seen to be a comment on the performance of the monarch, and it was not meant in any way to cause offence to those in the Australian community who deeply believed that Australia should hold to its current political structures and retain the Queen of England as the Queen of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But Labor in government recognised the political realities of Australia as it moves beyond the year 2000 and the necessity for
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3732"> the government of the day to take a leadership role in putting this issue squarely before the Australian people. Simply, the time has come for an Australian republic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We put this item firmly up the political agenda, at considerable political cost. That cost was extracted by the conservative parties in this country when in opposition. They sought to diminish a fine national debate by dragging it into the partisan political arena. Nothing has changed since they came to power. This whole notion of a people's convention has simply one aim in mind; that is, to diminish and delay the process by which Australia finally moves to become a republic and to have an Australian head of state. That is the real agenda that was put by the conservative parties when in opposition and the one being pursued now that they are in government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No government that firmly believes in the principle of widespread public debate before significant constitutional changes are made and in participation and fairness would have come up with such a bill and presented it to the House. It is patently unfair, it is patently biased and it is structured so that this whole process by which the nation moves towards an Australian republic is diminished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But there is one thing the conservative parties in this country have never been able to do, and that is to stop the march of Australian history. They may be able to stall it for the life of their Prime Minister (Mr Howard) or the life of the parliament but, as surely as the night turns to day, Australia will have an Australian as its head of state and, as surely as day turns to night, Australia will become a republic. It is not a question of if; it is a question of when.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, this government is squandering one of the most unique opportunities we have had in this century to propel Australia to a new level of national debate over an issue central to the formation of our identity and to our political development beyond the year 2000. We can strip all the arguments away because it all comes down to one proposition: at the core of this debate in the parliament today about constitutional conventional processes is the essential question that nobody
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> can deny or avoid, and that is, simply, should Australia have an Australian as its head of state? That is the core issue. This bill is merely a reflection of and an attempt to establish a flawed process by which Australia as a nation should be considering this essential question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one very easy way to test the water on this in a national, political sense, and that is to put the basic proposition to the vote, put the simple question to the Australian people: `Do you want an Australian to be the head of Australia?' I think that, when we put that question, there will be an overwhelming and resounding positive statement by the Australian people that the time has come in our political history for us to take the final step and to unleash the great energies of this nation to give hope to our young people that there is a new dawn approaching in the Australian political system and there is a new dawn in their own history. That is not a statement that denies our past, but it is time that we made a statement about our future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The responsibility for the carriage of this most critical and important national debate rests fairly and squarely on the shoulders of the Prime Minister. It is the Prime Minister who really has the leadership role in this critical issue of national debate. What has this Prime Minister done in his time in opposition and now in his time in the prime minister's chair? He has thrown every political obstacle and mounted every political argument against the basic proposition that Australians should have an Australian head of state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have thought any person in this parliament and outside of it who was committed essentially to Australia, to the formation of its national identity, to the preservation of its cultural traditions and to the preservation of its great democracy would answer that simple question in the positive, that Australia should have an Australian as its head of state. Yet here we have a Prime Minister of a nation who cannot even take the one simple step of leadership and say to his own constituency and to the national constituency that it is time that Australia had an Australian head of state.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3733">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is deeply regrettable that in 1997 the Prime Minister of Australia cannot in his own mind and in his own heart countenance the very simple proposition that Australia should have an Australian head of state. It is not surprising that this Prime Minister cannot take that final step, because in every area of his prime ministership the issue of leadership keeps cropping up. The Prime Minister has consistently failed, in the brief time that he has occupied the prime minister's chair, to demonstrate to this nation his capacity for real political leadership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a matter of common political knowledge that the coalition parties turned to John Howard because they had nowhere else to go. The dream team, the fabulous twosome, the young turks, the young bucks that were going to lead the coalition parties beyond the year 2000 fell at the first steeple. To whom did the coalition parties turn? To John Howard as Prime Minister, somebody that the Australian people had rejected on a previous occasion and even his own party had rejected on other occasions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is not surprising to me that the Prime Minister cannot take the final mental decision to commit himself to the proposition that Australia should have an Australian head of state. He has failed the leadership test on ministerial standards. We have seen in the life of this parliament already a considerable debasement of the ministerial code of conduct that the Prime Minister held to his breast and waved before the Australian people at the last election. He has failed to impose the ministerial standards on his cabinet that were the simple hallmark and were the simple principles by which Labor ministers lived in their ministerial jobs for some 13 years. He has failed the test of ministerial standards and he has failed the leadership test in that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we go to areas of significant policy expression and development in this country, if we go to the area of industry policy, we see that the Prime Minister fails to provide leadership. We keep coming back to the central proposition that this Prime Minister fails the leadership test. When we come to this very critical, national, political issue of whether Australia should engage itself in a meaningful
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> process of constitutional change and whether Australia should confront the simple proposition that it ought to have an Australian as its head of state, the Prime Minister backs away yet again and he fails that essential leadership test.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition have mounted a series of amendments which we believe improve a very bad piece of legislation. We are not happy with this bill and we are not happy with this process. We can simply resolve this argument tomorrow with a simple plebiscite, a simple question put to the Australian people, but the Prime Minister refuses to do it. He wants to go in a convoluted way to try to debase the process and debase the issue. We are proposing a series of amendments to this legislation in the hope that what comes out at the end of the tunnel, what comes out of this parliamentary process, although the process might be flawed, is a bill that reflects some honour and reflects some&mdash;what shall we say; what can it reflect&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Integrity, that is the word. I was searching for a very simple word that would describe this particular legislation. My colleagues have gone through the limitations of this legislation, and those limitations are substantial. The first one of course is the voting system that is going to be employed. We know that this is the thin end of the wedge as far as voluntary voting is concerned. It has been pointed out by my colleagues that the financial difference between holding a compulsory ballot and holding a voluntary ballot is in the region of $9 million to $10 million. A compulsory attendance ballot would cost in the region of $49 million and the existing proposition is going to cost in the region of $40 million.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But there are other important propositions in this legislation that are really offensive. This legislation compromises the notion of a secret ballot&mdash;the `Australian ballot'&mdash;that we hold dear and that is really at the heart of Australian democracy. This legislation will disenfranchise many people in this country. The Australian Electoral Commission admits that there are two million people who move their places of residence in any one year. It is
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3734"> estimated that, at the end of the day, some three million people may be disenfranchised by this piece of legislation and by this procedure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) has quite aptly pointed out to me some of the more interesting features of this piece of legislation. It devotes some 16 sections to how voting will be undertaken in Antarctica. There is no provision here to ensure that the 200,000 Australians who are travelling abroad in any one year&mdash;people in London, for example&mdash;are able to cast a ballot or a vote in this process, but here we have 16 sections of the bill devoted to how voting might be undertaken in Antarctica. Section 85 provides for assistance to the frail aged and the infirm in Antarctica, but nowhere in this piece of legislation is there a provision to assist Australians who might be travelling overseas to cast their votes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, there is the need for the Australian community to engage in this critical national debate. I recently participated in a community forum organised by the Centre for Citizenship and Human Rights and the Constitutional Centenary Foundation. It was held at the Deakin University's wool stores campus. The topic for discussion was `Towards the 21st century: our possible tomorrows'. The member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) participated in that debate as well. It was a very important community forum and participation in these sorts of community forums ought to take place right around the nation in considering this very important issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister has failed the leadership test. The government has set out to sabotage the whole notion and the whole movement of this country towards an Australian republic and, as I said at the start of this debate, as sure as day turns to night they will fail.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been told that I have about only five minutes to speak, so I will make my comments on the Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill brief. Let me just reinforce the comments made by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) on this matter about the huge problems with the process that has been
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> put into place and the huge shortcomings with the election of the representatives for this convention.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very concerned that the process which has been put in place will disenfranchise the people who are most vulnerable in our community. It will also disenfranchise many people whose knowledge of English is not great. Why will it do that? Because we know already, from the local government elections in Victoria and those other places where this postal ballot approach has been taken, that the people who miss out the most are people of non-English speaking background. Also, when we consider that the Aboriginal community will not be able to take advantage of the mobile booths that they have become accustomed to, the Aboriginal community will miss out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The idea is that there is going to be a convention to determine some key questions about the whole future of the Australian constitution, especially in relation to the question of the republic. We are to put in place an electoral process for the representatives to this convention which is severely flawed to the point where it is going to disenfranchise a large number of people. We are talking about estimates of up to a million people of different backgrounds, and certainly a very significant number of people of non-English speaking background.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the features, for example, of the envelope that people have to fill in is that at the back of the envelope you have to put your date of birth. If you do not put your date of birth, it will be considered that you have not filled the form in legitimately or properly and it will not count as a vote. Is the instruction that you need to put in your date of birth put in different languages? Are people given an explanation in different languages? Of course not. Will there be publicity in different languages to ensure that people are aware of this provision? Unlikely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You are going to get a situation where there is not only a problem about the print being too small and people not being able to read what is there but also a problem of people from the various ethnic communities in this country, many of whose English is limited but
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3735"> who would like to participate in the debate through their own community forums, through their own media, through the various ethnic media, et cetera, not being able to read the instructions and not being able to understand the process. What is wrong with keeping to the process of going to a polling booth&mdash;a process that has been established in this country for so many years?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People understand democracy. They understand elections as going to a polling booth and voting at a polling booth. This idea of introducing this corrupt process of postal ballots, as occurs with the councils, is now to be extended to the constitutional convention. I can tell you this: the government's intention is obvious. By making the process voluntary rather than compulsory, they think that they are going to open the door to the introduction of voluntary voting in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me give the minister at the table, the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Jull), a little bit of an idea. We will oppose tooth and nail any attempt to move away from compulsory voting, which has served this country very well and which has given us a dynamic democracy. If this is part of what you have in mind, you can forget it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia is a multicultural nation of many peoples of different backgrounds who have come together to live together, work together and grow together as a people. In this context, as the former Prime Minister said, the British monarchy is not relevant. It is not relevant to Australia any more. In particular, overwhelmingly it is not relevant to people from ethnic and multicultural backgrounds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Paul Keating said, the people of modern Australia are drawn from virtually every country in the world. It is no reflection on the loyalty of a great many of them to say that the British monarchy is a remote and inadequate symbol of their affections for Australia. That was one of the reasons why he initiated the debate and moved the country along towards this discussion of a republic. We need to have that discussion, and we need to continue with that discussion. But the discussion and the outcome will not be fair, will not be legitimate, if the process for the election of these delegates is flawed.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For that reason we will be moving a whole series of amendments to try to make the process much better and much more democratic. We hope that the government will support those processes. But if it does not, then that itself opens up the whole question of how genuine the government is about having a real debate with the whole of Australia, with people from a variety of backgrounds, about this central issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unless the government meet the concerns raised by the opposition, it shows that they are not serious, especially about consulting people of such a diversity of backgrounds and ensuring that everybody has a say in what is going to happen to the future of the constitution and especially the republic.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I concluded my remarks, being interrupted on 26 March 1997, I was talking about victimology, despair and failure. The issue is one where too many young people&mdash;in fact too many in our society, particularly over the past 13 years under a Labor administration&mdash;have come to believe, and have been told by people who believe they are doing well in the social welfare field, that these individuals are victims of society and that there is nothing about their circumstances that they themselves
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> can do to improve, that society needs not only to look after them but also to nurture them, foster them, develop and provide for them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a sense, in Australia we have become too dependent on outsiders. We have become too dependent on government and government services. In a sense, we have partially lost that age old tradition of taking care of ourselves, doing for ourselves, growing within ourselves and benefiting from our own work and efforts. I hope that the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Work for the Dole) Bill will start to help us redress a minor portion of that problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the last few weeks since the parliament stopped sitting in March I have had the opportunity to talk to hundreds and hundreds of young people around Australia who are school age children. Over and over again I or one of my colleagues asked these children what they thought of the work for the dole scheme, whether they thought it was fair and equitable, whether they thought they would participate if they could not find a job or whether they thought their colleagues, friends and neighbours who were currently on unemployment benefits and on the dole would approve of such a program. I can tell you that universally the hundreds of young people I spoke to approved the concept of the work for the dole scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is significant that young people themselves apparently believe that it is right and proper that, if a person is to receive assistance from the government for their living expenses when they cannot find work, they should put something back into the community, which is funding their living expenses, in order to help the community. Many of the young people that we spoke to said they believed that many young people who were on unemployment benefits really just did not want to work. They may have been naive to some degree, and I could not tell you to what degree that is, but there was a strong feeling that there is work available for young people. It might not be the kind of work that they wanted. It might not be a management job, it might not be the managing director's job and you might have to get your hands dirty. It might be menial work that is sometimes uninteresting and
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3744"> sometimes at inappropriate or inconvenient hours, but that work is available and, for those who wanted to work, employers in the main are willing to give young people a go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is really significant. These hundreds of young people believe that, if they have the right attitude and if they have a bit of skill training, they can find some meaningful employment&mdash;some employment in some field in the area in which they live. These young people universally said that they approved of the work for the dole scheme and that they thought it would help those who do not have work and depend on the public for their living  to have a better life, improve themselves, and understand better the nature of work, what it is all about and how they have to approach that work itself. There is no question whatsoever that anyone who has never worked cannot truly understand the nature of work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recall back in March the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) was talking about the time when we had a system of on&hyphen;the&hyphen;job training in Australia. He was, in a sense, decrying the fact that that age had gone. I have no disagreement with the member for Curtin. I too might wish that that time was still here, but it is not. I might wish that the time when the majority of society was made up of what we now call nuclear families still continued and that the high divorce rates that we see today did not exist in our society, but wishing will not make it go away. The nature of work has changed. The nature of jobs has changed. The kinds of jobs that we have out there in real work have changed. All have changed and we have to learn to adapt, work and live with that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The work for the dole scheme is not a panacea for  unemployment. It is not meant to be seen as giving young people the permanent kind of real employment that they need. It is seen as an opportunity to benefit those who do not have work and who need some work experience in order to be able to convince future real employers that they may be able to benefit their company, operation or business. That is certainly very positive. They will gain skills that help them better fit into society, to have meaningful lives; real work
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that gives them value, contentment and enjoyment as well as remuneration out of that work for the dole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During committee travels over the last few weeks while parliament has not been sitting I have spoken to numbers of Aboriginals and others having to do with the CDEP scheme. That scheme, run by ATSIC, is for unemployed Aboriginals. It provides basically the same incentives as the bill we are talking about today will provide: work for two or three days proportionate to the amount of receipt of the dole. The people who accept the CDEP scheme&mdash;those Aboriginal young people and sometimes middle-aged people who work under that scheme&mdash;voluntarily give up their social security payments as the dole and instead they receive a payment for work that they do on that program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The responses I had from people telling me about whether those programs worked or not differed depending on which Aboriginal community was talking about the program. Some were very positive. They said that the work they undertook involved good community development programs that helped the communities overall and that the young people developed a sense of worth and more of a sense of belonging to the community because they were contributing to the community. They had also developed some work skills and some understanding of what the world of work was like. Others were not so positive. They said that some of the jobs were a bit demeaning and sometimes they did not produce the outstanding results that appeared in other communities. But it is inevitable when programs are run that there are varying results depending on the area and depending on the people.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In supporting the amendment moved by the member for Sydney (Mr Peter Baldwin) to the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Work for the Dole) Bill 1997, the Labor Party recognises the serious problem of youth unemployment and the major
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3745"> social consequences arising from this problem. However, we believe the government's proposal is, at best, a lazy one that has not been thought through. It is an unconsidered attempt to overcome this problem and I really believe that our young unemployed deserve better.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposal of the government is important in many ways as much for what it does not say as for what it does. Firstly, it is a clear indication that the government does not expect unemployment to drop significantly in the near future. This is understandable when you consider that the official unemployment figures had increased to 810,800 or 8.8 per cent of the work force in January of this year.  The figures for March and April were 8.7 per cent. But the important point is that full&hyphen;time employment continues to decline.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposal is a panic move. As the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) himself said during the election campaign:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We do not support the introduction of a work for the dole scheme.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) also said some time back in 1995:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no thought at all . . . of making any kind of work for the dole scheme a compulsory scheme.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">But that is what the government has done. As Alan Ramsey said in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>  of 22 March:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And if the scheme is so popular, both with the community at large and young people themselves, why the necessity to legislate for compulsion? Why does the Government want the right to force people to work in what is supposed to be essentially a range of pilot programs if there are, as it claims, so many people willing to take part?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The second issue that this proposal tells us about the government is that there was no real program to get unemployed people back into the work force. Unlike what the Labor government achieved with its Working Nation program, which created over 739,000 jobs in the last three years of that government's term, the coalition government has responded to rising unemployment by ripping out $1.8 billion from labour market programs.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even the choice of the appropriate minister to run this program gives us an insight into the government's thinking. Senator Vanstone, who is the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs and who administers what is left of labour market programs, has been overlooked. The junior minister, Dr Kemp&mdash;the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training&mdash;has been given the responsibility for running this program. I hope the relationship between schools and working for the dole is purely coincidental.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third issue that arises out of this proposal is that it is award free. The minister, Dr Kemp, in his second reading speech, specifically said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendments to the Social Security Act 1991 would also establish that participation in work for the dole would not give rise to an employer&hyphen;employee relationship for the purposes of the following acts:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employees) Act 1991;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992; or</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the Workplace Relations Act 1996.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">No way. The government does not want these people covered by an award because this would allow these people to stand up for their rights. It might even get the trade union movement involved&mdash;and, clearly, the government would not want that to happen. Once again, I believe the coalition government is using the work for the dole scheme to condition people not to be too worried about award coverage when and if they enter the work force on a full&hyphen;time basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fourth issue that causes me some concern in the proposal&mdash;it is not clearly spelt out&mdash;is whether people who are working for the dole will take the jobs of other people. This is a major problem. Unless the work involved is as menial as sweeping the footpath&mdash;and if that is the case, the proposal is a waste of time&mdash;and if there is any element of skill or value to the community, whether it be in tourism, environmental work, restoration work or a community service, there is an
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3746"> important principle that should be followed; that is, this work should be carried out by people employed on a full&hyphen;time basis under award conditions. This would enable unemployed people to have full&hyphen;time jobs and some self&hyphen;respect. It would take them off social security and make them self&hyphen;respecting taxpayer members of the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fifth issue is the proposal that people work for the dole either two or 2&half; days a week. This is a clear case of conditioning people for part&hyphen;time work as a way of life. This is an attack on the working conditions of Australians. Job growth is in the part&hyphen;time area, as we all know. In January there were 38,400 new jobs created: 35,000 of those were part time. The government is saying that if you work 20 hours you are considered as  being in full&hyphen;time employment. Part&hyphen;time employment means that working conditions that are so important to the blue&hyphen;collar, middle&hyphen;income and lower income people could well be lost. Very important conditions such as annual leave, long service leave, sick leave, maternity leave and compassionate leave will tend to drift into the past under the government's work for the dole proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What are employer groups saying about this scheme? In an article by Mark Davis and Louise Dodson in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 11 February, employers' views are expressed as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Employers have warned that the federal government's work&hyphen;for&hyphen;the&hyphen;dole plan is unlikely to make the young long&hyphen;term jobless any more attractive to them as potential employees. Private sector groups yesterday reacted coolly to the government's plan, warning that most firms would be reluctant to take on long&hyphen;term unemployed, even if they had work for the dole.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The article continued with a quote from Garry Brack, who is the Executive Director of the Employers Federation of New South Wales. I quote Mr Brack's remarks:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The longer somebody has been out of the workforce, the less attractive they become&mdash;because they become detached from all the things that are relevant to work, including getting out of bed and being at work on time, being motivated to perform.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Gary Brack concluded:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That may make schemes like this desirable from a societal point of view. But you have still got to find some way of making them attractive to employers.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is a very important point that employers themselves are making about the work for the dole program. They are saying it will not work. So where are we going to go when these people have completed work for the dole? Are they going to go back on unemployment again?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my own electorate of Greenway, the President of the Blacktown Chamber of Commerce and Industry has this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The federal government's scheme of making people work for the dole will do little to tackle western Sydney's high unemployment rate. Unemployed need structured training and real work experience if they are ever going to get a job. The Howard government recently cut back on most schemes that provided this type of structured training and work experience. The Chamber participated in these schemes last year and was able to place over 100 people in real jobs. This year because of the cutbacks we missed out.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was a view being expressed by the President of the Chamber of Manufactures in my electorate of Greenway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I intend to ensure that my electorate is well aware of the 11 points that the Labor Party is trying to get into this legislation, which will strengthen it considerably. The government will not be permitted to forget that it abolished all decent programs while using our words to describe and reintroduce new programs which all seemed to be tarred with the same brush, as is shown in the work for the dole proposal. I will move through the 11 points fairly quickly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first point is that the scheme should not displace existing workers. The second point is that resources must be made available to enable payment for activities at the relevant national training wage award rate. The third point is that participants must be guaranteed accredited on&hyphen; or off&hyphen;the&hyphen;job training within the work activity. I will pause here, because this is a very important point which is missing from the work for the dole proposal and will virtually mean that the people who are doing this work will not get any accreditation or recognition if they do obtain some skills.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3747">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To support that point, I would like to refer to a paper presented to the Tasmanian Education Consortium in Hobart in October of last year by Richard Sweet from the Dusseldorf Skills Forum. That speech contained this paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another way to build upon young people's experience of part&hyphen;time, casual and temporary work would be to recognise it better. The intention here should not be to build recognition around national competency standards that assume continuity of employment within a defined occupation or industry, for young people who spend significant periods of time on the margins of the labour market rarely spend continued periods of time in the same job. The intent should be to recognise basic employability attributes that are important in all work, rather than those competencies that are specific only to some forms of work, and by recognising them better, help to define and shape them in the minds of young people and of employers. Better recognition of the skills gained in part&hyphen;time, casual and temporary work would also involve a much clearer documentation of the skills that young people acquire at particular work sites, and the building up of these, together with a record of progress in achieving key generic employability attributes, into a portfolio or skills record.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">If that type of training and documentation of the work that young people do on the dole were available, it would clearly strengthen the proposal. I would urge the government, in considering this legislation, to take very considerable consideration of the remarks of people such as Richard Sweet, who are quite knowledgeable in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will move on to the other points we believe should be contained in this legislation. Point four is that appropriate case management and supervision must be available to all participants, to assist them to make decisions about opportunities under work for the dole management and associated on&hyphen; and off&hyphen;the&hyphen;job training. Point five is that participants must be able to leave the scheme to accept employment opportunities, without penalty. Point six is that access to financial assistance must be available to potential employers, to cover such costs as supervision and materials.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Point seven is that the government must ensure that appropriate levels of financial support for workers compensation, superannuation and safety aspects are available. Point eight is that financial assistance must be
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> available to participants for unavoidable employment related costs, such as protective clothing, safety equipment, transport and child care. Point nine is that placements must offer opportunities for a minimum of six months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Point 10 is that organisations contracting to provide employment projects must state the proportion of people who will gain permanent employment following the placement. Future contracts should be based on performance against these commitments. Point 11 is that implementation should not require further trials. The experience of the Working Nation programs, such as LEAP and new work opportunities, provides more than enough effective models on which to build a successful program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As honourable members can see by studying the foregoing, we on this side of the House have strong policies and have researched quite deeply what is necessary to get young unemployed people back into the work force. The policies are fair and reasonable but ensure that those very disadvantaged young people can in no way be exploited by enthusiastic amateur employers or unscrupulous entrepreneurs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that we are restricted in time, so I will conclude my remarks by quoting at random a couple of views of people who have some interest in this field. My own branch of the Australian Labor Party has written to me expressing three of its concerns relating to the work for the dole proposal. One is the potential exploitation of the unemployed. The branch says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Members were concerned that the unemployed participating in this scheme would be paid at below&hyphen;award rates;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The second is excessive exposure to risk. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not clear, for example, as to whether or not scheme participants will be covered by comprehensive accident insurance while on the job;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The third is a lack of focus on developing career paths. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many branch members argued that the scheme is designed more with an eye to satisfying public opinion rather than removing the structural and/or individual hurdles which are preventing the long term jobless from obtaining meaningful employ
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3748"> ment. It was the view of the Branch that the Government's Work for the Dole proposal will not promote the development of sound career paths . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) referred to the inquiry conducted by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training and its tour to a number of states in Australia where he had contact with a number of school children. I was also on that committee and that review. It is true that there is a mixture of views as to whether this is a good thing for people who are unemployed. I would suggest that young school people would not have a full understanding of all the ramifications of the work for the dole proposal&mdash;it might seem to them to be a good idea.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will quote three items from a submission that was put to the committee by the Australian Youth Policy and Action Coalition. In my  view, this was a very good submission. It had a lot of support. It spoke on behalf of young people and was drawn up by young people. I think the government would be very wise to take note of it. They say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AYPAC rejects the proposition that a response to a declining youth labour market should include a compulsion that young people participate in programs that force them to perform work for continued receipt of Government income support. Such programs, typically called work for the dole schemes, do not provide a solution to the central problem that confronts unemployed young people, ie, a lack of real sustainable jobs that will provide them with an independent living income. Work for the dole schemes do not solve youth unemployment, they force young people to perform work no one else wants to do for below poverty line . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They also make the point:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Work for the dole schemes act only to marginalise young people into areas of work that do not attract a market income. Such marginalisation serves only to exclude young people for longer periods from the mainstream labour market, is not an efficient way to improve young peoples skills and will not assist young people to move to independence. Forcing young people to perform work on a compulsory basis that no one else wants to do or will pay to be done is simply a form of exploitation and neglect.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The final point I raise from this submission reads:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Work for the dole proposals recognise the chronic nature of youth unemployment but do nothing to resolve the key issue of significant job deficit. Work for the dole and make work programs are neither an equitable nor practical solution to youth unemployment. They are, in fact, an admission of failure.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I once again emphasise that the government would be very wise to take note of those three points that I have quoted from the submission of the Australian Youth Policy and Action Coalition.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In early January, prior to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) announcing the introduction of a work for the dole scheme, I floated the idea of a work for the dole scheme in my electorate of Capricornia whilst being interviewed by the leading <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Morning Bulletin</EMPHASIS>  news journalist, Mr Jason Purdie. The idea received front&hyphen;page headlines and a lot of positive community reaction. I made the suggestion on the basis that if it was good enough for Aboriginal communities to work for the dole under the community development employment program, then it should be good enough for other recipients of unemployment benefits to work for the dole as well. While there are two sets of rules in this country&mdash;for black and white&mdash;the country will continue to be divisive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We Australians live in a multicultural society. I do not care what is the land of your origin, the colour of your skin, the look of your face or the accent of your tongue. We all have a common goal&mdash;that is, to make Australia the best place on earth to live. The public reaction to the work for the dole scheme was mixed. But what most surprised me was the reaction from the young people in the community. Almost all of those who were approached by different sections of the media supported a concept of a working system for the dole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we floated the idea, we were approached straightaway by many different community service groups, like New Horizons and Centacare. When we looked at the scheme, we thought that maybe local councils should become involved in it. Basically we would have the mayors of each of the shires
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3749"> on our board, particularly from places like Capricornia because there are so many shires within that electorate. The idea was to ensure that projects put forward for work for the dole recipients to do would not take work away from small business. As far as I can see, it is absolutely imperative that small business be looked after, particularly in respect of these schemes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The scheme could go many different ways. Participants could help the elderly by mowing lawns, taking the elderly shopping and acting as carers, basically helping them to remain in their homes longer. Many of the elderly wish to stay at home and do not want to be put into nursing home centres and those sorts of things. They would love the opportunity to be able to stay at home. I am more than sure that, if implemented in the right way and with the right people with the right attitude, this could happen with the work for the dole scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, as far as that is concerned, I commend the young people in my electorate for this positive attitude in relation to their statements in the media on the work for the dole scheme. However, some of the older generation in the community did not agree that they should work for the dole, and some of them wrote to the local newspapers and telephoned my office to voice their protest. Most of these people were genuinely looking to find employment, but they could not find anything in their hunt for that elusive job. They want to continue to look for that job on a full&hyphen;time basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am compassionate towards their point of view and I would much rather see people searching for a job on a full-time basis as long as they were actually doing something to ensure that they were going to get a job, and there are many different systems that we could implement. Therefore, before we impose the work for the dole requirement on people over the age of 21, I would like to see a set of standards imposed on claiming unemployment benefits and those who do not meet those standards can then be required to work for the dole. The sorts of standards I would look at are based on the number of jobs
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> applied for and, of course, interviews undertaken, particularly over a given time. We could evaluate this through the social security employment diary that was implemented by this good government in the past year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is fair and reasonable that young Australians in receipt of the jobsearch allowance participate in approved work for the dole programs in return for such payments, especially until the job market picks up and there are more employment opportunities available. The reason I say that it is fair and reasonable to expect young people to work on these programs is that most of them have never had a job and have never paid tax. This means that they have not contributed to the welfare of this country, yet they expect to be supported by the government. I know there will be moans and groans out there from some parents that they have paid tax and contributed to welfare so the welfare system should look after their children, but in so many cases today we see the parents unemployed as well which causes an enormous drain on this country's finances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe we should restrict unemployment benefits to young people under the age of 21. I believe we should institute a program that provides young people with a number of alternatives to unemployment benefits. They should be required either to have a job to go to, to attend a university or TAFE training, to go on the work for the dole scheme or&mdash;and I have floated this idea before and there are many people out there who agree with it&mdash;to go into a type of national service or, as some like to call it, boot camp.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should be instilling in our young people, especially those still at school, that there will be no access to unemployment benefits until they have worked or paid tax for at least two years. This, I believe, will engender a different philosophical attitude among our young people. Currently they are being told by their teachers, parents or their mates, `If you can't get a job, go on the dole and the taxpayer will keep you.' That attitude must cease. It is creating a lethargic society of young people. They must learn that it is tough out there in the big wide world and that this world owes them nothing.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3750">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as I can see, they must get in there and have a go, put their best foot forward. They should be encouraged to stand up for themselves and make sure that this is the best way to go. I am sure that the young people will realise that they have to contribute to society rather than look for that inevitable handout. I am also sure that, when prospective employers start to search for new staff, those people who have been on the work for the dole scheme will be the sorts of people the employers want to pick up. Those people have a work ethic. Those students who have just left school want to have a go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training and we have spoken to many employers and youth groups. The employers have said, `If we're looking for an employee, we'll look for somebody who has probably done some time at McDonald's or somebody who has gone out there and had a go and done some part-time work.' This is indicative of the way the country is. Employers want young people who have a good attitude to work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of employers in my electorate have indicated to me that they would view someone who has been on this work for the dole scheme more favourably than someone who has been unemployed for 12 months or more. I am aware of some complaints that the work for the dole scheme does not provide these young people with job training and only treats them as slave labour. While the scheme is not meant to provide specific training needs, I am certain that any young person who volunteers for one of these programs will work better, particularly after getting a working education, than someone who has sat in front of the TV for so long.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a mentality in the youth of today that when they come home from school they sit down in front of the TV. They do not go outside and do something for themselves. While that mentality is there, we are always going to have problems.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Training is expensive. We have seen how much it can cost with the figures provided by the former government's new work opportunities scheme, which cost the princely sum of $143,000 per head to train people. For what? It was only to go back on the dole queue again. In most instances, the training they received was totally wasted. Sure, they learnt how to plant trees and lop branches and, as the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) promotes, the painting of rocks. You really must question his credibility. He attacks the government about putting forward a scheme that the majority of good Australians are calling for, but I am sure something could be arranged should the government make it an order of the day.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Commenting again on Labor's new work opportunities scheme, what was the use of it all, especially when no level of government was increasing its work force in the parks and gardens area or employing more rangers to look after the environment? In fact, most levels of government were shedding staff. All we ended up with was a surplus of nurserymen and women that nobody wanted. What? For $143,000 a pop? You have to be kidding!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former government must be condemned for providing such a waste of taxpayers' money and a complete waste of the applicants' time and trouble. This philosophy is typical of the Labor Party, which is the socialist welfare mentality that I was talking about before. They spend all the taxpayers' money on poorly planned employment programs that give little or no positive result so
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3751"> that people are so dependent on the government that they cannot afford to be without the high level of welfare.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The young people in our country need to get rid of the cobwebs. They need to get out of the house for a couple of days a week and work on local community projects so they can feel proud of their efforts. It will improve their self-esteem, it will improve their communication skills and it will provide them with a work ethic. Most of all, it will give them something productive to do for the benefit of everyone in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend this bill to the House, but I also call on the government to look at some of my other broad suggestions, particularly in relation to restricting unemployment benefits to those under 21. People in this country must have a work ethic. They must know what it is all about. Going on the dole straight after finishing school is not a great initiative and it does not help contribute to this great community that we live in.</PARA></SPEECH>

It is a phrase that resonates in the community and they think&mdash;as the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Marek), who has just scurried out of here, obviously believes&mdash;that all young people in Australia come home from school, sit around in front of the television and bludge off their parents. They think that, when young people leave school, they do not particularly want to get a job, instead they want to club in together, get a house somewhere, go to the beach all the time and just live off government welfare. As a consequence, work for the dole has been introduced as a concept which this government thinks is going to salve the economic ills of this country.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the reality of what is being proposed here, and it was even in the budget released earlier this week. Ten thousand pilot projects form the basis of this great bit of social revolution, this great centrepiece of economic fundamentalism in Australia&mdash;10,000 places. They are notionally targeted at young people but, even as admitted by the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) himself, this could also apply to any age group within the broad Australian community. Whoopee&hyphen;do. What about the other nearly 900,000 people out there who presently, not through circumstances of their own making, not through their own fault, are also looking for employment opportunities?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had this government hell-bent on destroying anything that the Hawke-Keating governments put in place&mdash;whether it be in social security, whether it be in employment generation opportunities, whether it be in anything&mdash;simply because they want to extinguish from the landscape anything those former governments did. The honourable member for Capricornia talked about some of the One Nation programs and said, `They didn't do anything.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is being proposed under this work for the dole scheme? My colleague the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) was talking about painting rocks and so on. In fact, that is exactly the sort of thing the Prime Minister used to refer to when talking about these schemes before he suddenly had some sort of Damascus like conversion to saying that this was what was needed. And why? Because it was simply a phrase that resonated out there in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Suddenly, the Prime Minister jumped on the bandwagon&mdash;like he does with everything else he thinks is popular out there in the electorate. There was no leadership, no vision, no guidance from Australia's point of view. He said, `This is what we'll do. Here are 10,000 pilot projects. We'll give them a few dollars and get them out there in green corps or get them out there doing weed clearing somewhere.'</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3752">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no training. We could not have training&mdash;that would be abhorrent to those in the government. We could not have any training like we used to have in the programs that we had in place. There is going to be no recognition after the event. There is going to be no piece of paper saying these people were lucky enough to be part of the 10,000 out of the 900,000 unemployed. There is going to be no piece of paper to say they have some accreditation at the end of the scheme so they have something to set them up for life. As the member for Capricornia said, `All these young people don't want to work anyway. They want to sit in front of the television, play computer games and whatever.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think this issue is a bit beyond the joke that it has turned out to be. What was the genesis of this little brainstorm that the government had? The genesis was that the Prime Minister turned up at the Channel 9 studios one Sunday to be interviewed by Laurie Oakes. The government was under a tad of strain at the time because one of its number in the Senate had been caught out. There was some concern about Senator Woods and what he was and was not doing and whom he was doing it with. As a conse quence, the Prime Minister decided he needed some sort of a circuit breaker. He needed to make some sort of an announcement just to try to get the heat off the government. What did he come up with? Work for the dole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The interesting thing was that, 18 days after the announcement was made by the Prime Minister on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program, when anyone rang the minister who had responsibility for the delivery of the service&mdash;that is, the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) or the junior minister in this place&mdash;the only response they were given was a copy of the Prime Minister's press release and a copy of the transcript of the Prime Minister's appearance on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program. That is all they knew about it because no&hyphen;one had heard of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Vanstone, when asked about it the next day, shrugged her shoulders and in true Aunty Jack fashion said, `Well, I don't know. No-one's told me about it.' And that was exactly right. It was policy on the run. It has
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> been pointed out by a number of people on this side of the parliament when talking about this that there were all sorts of complaints levelled by people who were delivering services of this nature into the broad community about the effectiveness of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind people of an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on Monday 24 March 1997 by Glenn Milne under the headline `Work for dole plan hardly greeted with heavenly trumpets'. In this particular article, Milne goes through the circumstances of the scheme's genesis and talks about some views expressed by people and organisations that have delivered services to young unemployed and older unemployed for some time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He talks about the opinions of the Australian Youth Action Coalition, the Brotherhood of St Laurence, the Australian Catholic Social Welfare Commission, the Australian Council of Social Service and the Salvation Army. He talks about the Adelaide City Mission, the Australian Volunteers Association, the Sydney City Mission, the Open Family, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Australian Local Government Association. He talks about their views and he clearly indicates that these organisations&mdash;business and welfare organisations&mdash;were less than enamoured about the proposal. Having gone through and talked to all of these people, he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So, to sum up: five of the most representative church and social welfare umbrella groups in the country&mdash;groups conceivably critical to work for the dole's success&mdash;have fundamental objections to the scheme. The remaining social welfare groups have reservations about the scheme's worth without real training.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is right. I think that the concept of having younger and older unemployed people involved in some sort of a scheme is not a difficult thing to grasp. We did it under One Nation; we did it under Working Nation. But we included the training component with it. What is the point in simply putting people for six or 12 months on some sort of task which has been ill&hyphen;defined so far and then at the end of the day not having them trained in some way to be available to be taken on as `real employees' in&mdash;to use that dreadful term&mdash;
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3753">`real jobs' as distinct from `unreal jobs'. I have never been able to get what the Prime Minister means by that: what are real jobs and what are unreal jobs?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People talk about part&hyphen;time jobs in a derisory fashion. They say that part&hyphen;time jobs are no good, and that everybody wants a full&hyphen;time job. Well, people do not! I am sure a majority of people in the community want a full&hyphen;time job&mdash;and that is right. We all in this place should be striving to achieve that by economic policies that will see this country continue to grow. But there are other people who want part&hyphen;time jobs, so they should not be put down. They should not be simply dismissed out of hand and told, `You are some underclass; you have a part&hyphen;time job; you should not really be doing that; you should be striving for a full&hyphen;time job.' Parental responsibilities in some cases cannot allow that, so you do not put those people down. The Glenn Milne article goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Don't worry, though,&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">and he was talking about some leaked minutes from the meeting David Kemp, the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, had with all of these groups that I have mentioned. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Don't worry, though, the minutes also record that Kemp noted `a survey in this week's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS>  indicates 75 per cent support for the initiative'.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Glenn Milne continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Kemp is probably right then; work for the dole is a political goer. Which is all the Government probably really cares about.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think that is dead right. We on this side have tried to take a reasonable approach to this. We have actually moved a second reading amendment, not declining to give the bill a second reading in this House but having made some positive contributions to the debate. We have pointed out the training issue. There is a need for training for people&mdash;there is no question of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recent statistics indicate that people now change employment three times in their lifetime. At each of those occasions, they have to go through some reskilling, retooling and retraining. This program being advocated by this government does not even give them
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the first step, the first leg up to something which is as important as training. Australia has passed into this incredible technological society as we lead into the next century. I do not think anyone could deny that technology is a boon to humankind, but it is also a bane in some respects because technology displaces people from jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we are going to look at the concept of work into the next century, we have to change some of our more traditional views of what that means. It is not simply going to work from nine to five and doing a variety of tasks. We have to harness that technology and we have to make it work for us so that we make work for us, and that is an important element in any discussion here. We also need this two&hyphen;way commitment, this reciprocity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have heard coalition speaker after coalition speaker advocate that when we had some form of social security system in place, when we were in government, there was no reciprocity, there was no commitment on behalf of the recipients of social security benefits to give something back. That simply was not true. If people were not actively looking for meaningful employment, if people were not out there actually being case managed by people if they were longer term unemployed, their benefits were reduced or cut. There was reciprocity there. It was not the television syndrome that the member for Capricornia referred to. There was reciprocity and that is why it is an important element in any scheme of this nature. It is something that has to be really borne in mind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of the day, we should not be debating these pilot programs that are bandaid solutions to the more fundamental problem in Australia. Both sides of this parliament should be embracing an appropriate industry policy with two pinnacles: education and R&amp;D. In the last 14 months since this government has been in government, it has cut R&amp;D funding by $2 billion. You talk to any overseas country&mdash;any of the Asian tigers. Why do they have the substantial growth rates that they do? Because their governments know that they have to invest in those twin reasons, education and R&amp;D, to stimulate their economies. If you look at Malaysia, Singapore or
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3754"> any of those Asian tigers, it is in R&amp;D and education that investment is being made. For some unknown reason, this government in this country has decided that we do not need to do that. It is called business welfare.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not business welfare; it is national welfare. It is something which will assist industries promote new job opportunities to take up the slack that exists now from some of the industries which have more traditionally provided employment opportunities. I will give an example from my own electorate of Wollongong&mdash;and I have referred to BHP in a similar way before: in 1983, 26,000 people were directly employed at BHP; now, 6,800, and about to become about 5,000, yet productivity has gone through the roof. The steel industry is working effectively in the port of Port Kembla and in Wollongong more generally. The reason they have increased productivity is the investment of about $3 billion worth of high technology in that steel plant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That illustrates the difficulty for a region like the Illawarra. How do we offset those job losses yet at the same time recognise that heavy industry is still prospering and productivity is high? We have to look for something different. That is why the Illawarra Regional Economic Development Organisation two  weeks ago released a new economic strategy, a blueprint, a business plan, for the Illawarra. It talked about these sorts of things and the need for R&amp;D and education as fundamental rights of people in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regrettably, this work for the dole scheme skirts all of that. It is a bandaid solution. It does not meet the needs of this country. It does not meet the need for a meaningful industry policy. It does not do anything for education. It does nothing for R&amp;D. It gives young unemployed people and older unemployed people, of 40 years plus, no security in life. It does not give them any horizon or any vision because, regrettably, this weak Prime Minister, this weak leader, has no vision, has no philosophy, for where we should be going, and that is an absolute disgrace.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, with you and the Minister
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> for Defence (Mr McLachlan) in the chamber this afternoon, I might just say that I am looking forward to some positive recommendations from the Public Works Committee later this year in relation to the redevelopment of Lavarack Barracks, Townsville.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Work for the Dole) Bill sets out the amendments required to implement the popular work for the dole program. I know it is popular in Townsville because I have asked many of my Townsville constituents how they feel about this initiative. I can report to the House that it is widely accepted and warmly endorsed. The Townsville community supports both the philosophy and the intent behind this initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Townsville people strongly support this initiative in which predominantly young people, aged between 18 and 24, who receive unemployment benefits will be asked to work on community assistance and development programs in return for the assistance they receive from the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Earlier this year I held a public forum in Townsville. More than 130 people attended that meeting. On top of discussing a range of popular issues at the time&mdash;the Wik decision, euthanasia, crime, law and order, and so on&mdash;I specifically raised the issue of work for the dole. The feedback I received was that Townsville people are overwhelmingly in favour of the government implementing a work for the dole scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Might I also add that the people who attended and supported the concept believed the government had not gone far enough and that we should be introducing a far more stringent work for the dole program than is being proposed. There was great interest in and popular support for reintroducing some form of national service. Interestingly enough, this particular concept came predominantly from the younger people at the Townsville meeting. I personally have reservations about this. Yes, it might help instil discipline and drive in our young people, but the Australian Defence Force is not a social security safety net. If young people want to do part&hyphen;time military service, then they should inquire about joining the reserves.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3755">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My office started to receive initial calls from people about the work for the dole concept immediately after the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) announced the program. From there the level of interest has grown remarkably. While project submissions will not be sought until early June, the number of individuals and organisations already approaching my office with ideas about community projects indicates there is a high level of interest in the program in Townsville. I can only say that Townsville will put up such quality projects that I expect we will receive two pilot programs instead of one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Only last week an article ran in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> pointing to a growing support for the work for the dole program within the business sector. That article reads in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The controversial work for the dole proposal has been given its biggest boost, with an influential survey finding that three in five businesses would be more willing to employ someone with that experience.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Even menial labour would instil a work ethic and develop a greater sense of self&hyphen;worth in the unemployed, according to the Morgan and Banks Job Index survey of 3,200 employers conducted for The Age.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A total of 57.6 per cent of employers would be more willing to hire someone who had worked for  the dole rather than someone who had spent the same period receiving only unemployment benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a strong message in that. The article continues: <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Slightly more than a third&mdash;35.7 per cent&mdash;felt the scheme would make little difference to the employability of prospective workers, while only 1.8 per cent felt it would not help someone's prospects.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Further on in the article it states that polls have put community support for the introduction of a work for the dole scheme in some instances as high as 70 per cent. Mr Deputy Speaker, I would not be surprised if it were even higher than that in some parts of Australia. Indeed, at that last Townsville community forum I held, as a straw poll I asked for a show of hands from those people who supported the idea of work for the dole. About 75 per cent of more than 130 people who attended said they supported the concept of work for the dole.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many different ideas for projects were floated at that meeting, including linking bike paths throughout Townsville and Thuringowa, and house renovation and maintenance work for elderly and impaired citizens&mdash;very worthwhile projects indeed. Other people have suggested local environment projects such as erosion control for Townsville's northern beaches and the eradication of noxious weeds like lantana. All these ideas are worthy of development by the community groups who suggested them and of consideration for adoption by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to stress here today, as I have in my electorate, that the work for the dole program is not an employment creation program. This has been recognised time and again by both the Prime Minister and the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, the member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), in this House and in the media and by all members on this side of the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only people whom it seems it has not dawned on are the Labor opposition. The Labor opposition have jumped up and down on this issue. They shrilly claimed initially that it was slave labour in disguise and that they were going to amend the program so that it looked exactly like every other failed labour market program of the past 13 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just on that point: there has been a lot of hot air coming out of the belly of the shadow employment spokesman, the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson), about this. If the former government's labour market programs were so successful, why was the unemployment rate for the northern north-west Queensland statistical region, which takes in my electorate of Herbert, running at 11.9 per cent at the time of the last election in March 1996?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Batman has quoted the Australian Bureau of Statistics' figures for this region on one or two occasions since the coalition won office. On two occasions he has criticised the unemployment rate for this region as being unacceptably high and has said that it is a sign of failure of the Howard government in regional North Queensland. However, what the honourable member failed
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3756"> to add was that, even though the unemployment rate for the region was still too high&mdash;and it is&mdash;it was in fact some two to three per cent lower than when Labor lost the last election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I further point out to both the honourable member for Batman and you, Mr Deputy Speaker Andrew, that in February 1993 in the ABS statistical region that covers Townsville the unemployment rate was a whopping 14.5 per cent. That was not after 14 months of Labor government; that was after 10 years of Labor at the levers. If members opposite wish to cast stones, perhaps they would be wise to first come out from their glass houses which isolate them from the rest of mainstream Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But getting back to the bill: in the end the opposition has realised what we already know&mdash;that there is a great deal of community support for the work for the dole program. The honourable member for Goldstein made the following point in the second reading of this bill:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government recognises that the work for the dole initiative is not a solution to youth employment and has not represented it as such. Real jobs can only be created by the government providing a business environment that secures our economic future.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This was of course exactly the strategy in Tuesday's budget. Get the nation's finances right and increasing employment follows. That is why the government has taken steps to balance the budget and return it to a surplus. That is why I will be able to proudly say in my report to my electorate on television next Sunday night that for the first time in years the government is not borrowing a penny. It is a great result from Tuesday's budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why we have comprehensively changed Australia's industrial relations system so that now both employers and employees can get a better deal. That is why the coalition has scrapped Labor's job destroying unfair dismissal laws and replaced them with a system that gives employers, particularly those in small business, a fair go while protecting the rights of employees. That is why
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the coalition has taken steps to address the critically low numbers of apprenticeship and traineeship places in Australia through the modern Australian apprenticeship and traineeship scheme. That is why the coalition government, led by the Hon. Prime Minister, announced in March fringe benefits tax cuts and further capital gains tax cuts to small businesses, along with other initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Work for the dole is about requesting that people who are being supported by the community give something back to the community in return. It is about mutual obligation&mdash;pure and simple. The Hon. Prime Minister had some words to say in question time during the last parliamentary sitting on why we have decided to introduce the work for the dole scheme. Those words bear repeating, because I strongly support them. I quote the Prime Minister:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is the coalition&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">think it is destructive of the human spirit to be out of work indefinitely. We think it is destructive of the human spirit to grow up in an environment where your parents and perhaps your grandparents have been unemployed. We think it is desirable for the government of this country to approach . . . policies designed to ensure that people do not sink into a lifetime of unemployment, do not sink into an attitude of indifference towards work.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I strongly support this bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Work for the Dole) Bill has been put forward, as some of those in the government say, not as a response to solve the problem of youth unemployment. They have said that bluntly and frankly and they are correct. The truth is that it is not an answer to youth unemployment; it is simply a political positioning of this government responding to the natural and legitimate concern that they are hearing from all around Australia, particularly in regional and rural Australia, about the crisis that we face in being able to provide jobs for young Australians. They have put something up that will distract attention from the real issues and which has some superficial, glib coverage of support across the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3757">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not at all critical of those who support the idea of asking people who have been unemployed for a substantial period to make a contribution. There is a legitimate basis for building a system around the idea of mutual obligation. You would think that this government was the first to discover that idea. But in fact that was the whole idea behind the Working Nation scheme. What we did in government, when we were aware of exactly the same sense of need within the Australian community, was to devise a national scheme that applied to everyone so that no Australian who was out of work for a period of longer than two years would be left without the opportunity and the requirement to undertake work training programs of a substantial nature which would lead them to be better job ready.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those kinds of training programs, work generating programs, were in place and were cut by this government in its first budget. That is a national tragedy, because we were not talking about 10,000 people who were going to be singled out for a special program, after which they would not have improved their work related skills at all. We were talking about every Australian, whatever their age, who had been out of work for two years. It was not a voluntary scheme. It was not a scheme that relied on the goodwill of those who were unemployed for that period. What occurred under the Labor Working Nation initiatives was that, once a person reached that benchmark to maintain access to benefits, they had to undertake those training programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was a direct relationship between the recipient of future ongoing benefits with willingness to improve their work related skills, to undertake training programs and to be involved in initiatives that would improve the community. All Australians who found themselves in that situation were the beneficiaries of that program. When this government came to office, what did it do? The biggest budget reduction across programs was in exactly those training related programs, in exactly those programs which did impose mutual obligation.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is basically nothing that gives hope to a person who is long-term unemployed. A long-term unemployed person can face for years the prospect that they will not be given the resources and the opportunities to get back into the workplace and that their skills base will not be increased. It is certainly true that the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) has introduced some smaller programs of a significantly diminished nature which the government represents as being equivalent to those which they replaced. But you just have to look at the dollar figures to realise what a complete fraud and what a complete hoax that proposition is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They have replaced programs that were extended to all with programs that will extend to few. They have reduced programs which cost a substantial amount from the community with programs that will essentially be funded at a much lesser rate and which do not do the job that is required. To cover the deficiency and to cover the fact that everybody would have correctly identified as a moral failure of government leaving people long-term unemployed without improving their resources and without making them job ready, they came up with the idea that you could get some words that would appeal to and resonate with the Australian public&mdash;as if they were doing something. It would be cheap and it would not apply to many Australians. But you could go out and say, `We've introduced a new program that most Australians will support.' They called it work for the dole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They called it work for the dole because they know from their polling that there are a lot of mums and dads at home who would look at their children who have been out of work for some period of time, look at them sitting dispiritedly in front of the television set or wandering off to the games arcade and the like, trying to fill in their time when they had not had access to any proper jobs training programs, and say, `Look, my kid needs to be made to do something.' Certainly, they feel that in relation to other kids in the street. It is a pretty normal, expected and predictable human reaction.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3758">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, instead of introducing a program that actually applied to all Australians in those circumstances so that skills levels would improve, what we got were the words, the rhetoric and the wind, but without the reality. So we actually have a program which is limited to a handful of those people in this long-term unemployed situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a program that is designed to give the appearance of addressing a problem without spending the money or doing the work that is necessary to achieve the objective. This is sham politics, it is poll-driven politics, where you wave a symbol in the air and you ask people to respect the symbol but ignore the reality. What we say from the opposition is that good government, moral government, government with actual leadership, does not focus on symbolism but actually focuses on doing the job. This government has singularly failed to do the job. Not only has it singularly failed to do the job with respect to those people who are long-term unemployed, but it is also actually increasing the number of people in that predicament. The number of Australians, in regional and rural Australia in particular, who are now finding themselves out of work, is increasing daily.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my own state of Tasmania the job queues are stretching week by week, and this government's most recent budget is only going to exacerbate that problem. There will be more sackings from the public sector and more closures of resources that the state requires&mdash;closure of offices like the Medicare  office in my own electorate. All these initiatives are being carried out without the recognition of their job damaging consequences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have a government which has initiated a national program of inaction in relation to the long-term unemployed, then developed some plausible words that they know the Australian public want to hear&mdash;a symbol to distract attention from the reality. At the same time, they are actually pursuing policies which, day by day, week by week, in all the regions of Australia, are putting more and more Australians on the dole queues, putting more and more Australians out of work.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thought it was a pretty significant irony the other day when the government discussed its new initiatives under the Natural Heritage Trust, a trust which I might say&mdash;wearing my hat as shadow minister for the environment&mdash;they have massively underfunded. I think the language the Americans have evolved to describe what this government has done is a `greenwash'. They are using it in the same way as a whitewash, where you cover what you are doing with words that you know the community is going to be attracted to. You say you are doing a lot but, underneath, you actually do not deliver what you have promised. You do not deliver what you have promised, because, with regard to the Natural Heritage Fund, the government has underfunded what it promised in Meeting our Commitments by $103 million for the first two budget years alone. That is $103 million short just on the trust.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead of having an opportunity to make major inroads in programs which would of course have had a significant labour content in terms of initiatives to revegetate and reafforest Australia&mdash;a whole range of other initiatives&mdash;we have had the biggest single environmental backdown in Australia's history. And it is covered up by ministers who come to the table and gloat about what they have done!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that news report, which said, `Howard is going to take this program and subvert it even further by shifting it away from its original environmental focus and turning it into a regional related job strategy, because they knew the word "jobs" was not going to be mentioned in the budget', on the same front page a headline down in the corner read: `2,500 Telstra employees to be sacked.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government knowingly pursues policies that have led to mass sackings right across this country. It stands aside when major national producers of steel products&mdash;for example, BHP&mdash;initiate change which will lead to the closure of steel manufacturing. It stands aside when there are threats to our shipbuilding industry until forced to act under pressure from criticism by this opposition. It sees staring in its face more and more people joining the dole queues, yet it stands aside on
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3759"> a whole range of issues of social responsibility and then massively attacks the public sector and throws more and more people out of work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government does not have an answer for growing unemployment. It resorts to `green&hyphen;wash' initiatives in the environmental field where it seeks to use language that it knows the Australian public will support but underneath it reduces funding, it reduces programs, and it subverts an initiative that the government itself announced as a massively important attack on the issues which Australia faces as a nation and which have to be addressed, such as environmental degradation and the need for the government to improve its record in that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then the government talks about what will happen in the work for the dole programs&mdash;how some of the people who will be picked up under that scheme will do some work on the environment. The government will not fund properly any of these programs, or train people properly, but will use fancy words which it thinks the Australian people will be mugs enough to buy as a substitute for real action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not surprising that right across regional Australia, in the bush, and in places like Tasmania and South Australia&mdash;where people see daily more and more jobs being lost in industries all around them, factory closures, reductions in the public sector, services being eliminated, Medicare offices being closed, Telstra public officials being removed and resources being stripped away&mdash;this government has to look for the cheap, down and  dirty solutions. That is what we have got here&mdash;a cheap, down and dirty solution not addressing the structural issues that this economy has generated, not doing what is required to extend the program across the whole of the community, but looking to respond to the natural and legitimate concerns of parents about the future of their kids and elderly people about where they are going in the future with a program that is simply designed to be a fig leaf to hide the underlying realities.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is designed to create a straw man, something that we can all look to while the real action takes place elsewhere. So the government waves some symbolic piece of paper in the air and declares victory but at the same time allows the defeat of the aspirations of the many Australians who are looking for some real opportunity to get back into the workplace under an industry policy in this country which says to Australians: `We have a sense of direction. We have some ideas about where this economy will go in the future and where Australian job opportunities will be in the future and we are pursuing a set of objectives that makes sense in that context.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the opposition deals with this bill with an appropriate degree of cynicism, knowing what this government is doing, which is clearly avoiding its national responsibilities. This opposition says to this government that if it really wants some respect from the Australian community it will not be fiddling at the edges and saying to the elderly: `Work five more years in the workplace, work till you die, and trade off your pension entitlements for a sum of money which is less than half what you would get in that area'; it will be doing something for young people seeking jobs. It should do something for the 40-year-olds who are facing insecurity in the employment market. It should do something for people across Australia and not just wave a rhetorical flag symbolically in order to distract attention from the crucial issues which should be at the heart of Australia's national policy making.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I congratulate the government, particularly the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer), for introducing this work for the dole legislation, the Social Security (Work for the Dole) Bill. It works on the principle of mutual obligation, where society has an obligation to provide financial assistance for those who cannot find work but where unemployed people also have an obligation to offer something in return for that financial assistance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Particularly in the electorate that I represent, Richmond, this policy is very relevant. The
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3760"> Richmond/Tweed/ Mid North Coast, unfortunately, has one of the highest levels of regional unemployment in Australia. The most recent ABS figure was 13.3 per cent&mdash;the third highest in the state. However, I suppose it is pleasing to note that the unemployment rate has been starting to come down since September, at 16.7 per cent, and in October last year, 16.9 per cent. The DSS figures also indicate that the unemployment level is levelling out with newstart. In the last month it totalled 51,081, compared with 54,000 in January and 53,000 in March. So the far north coast will benefit enormously from this initiative, as we have high regional unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The local reaction when this idea was first brought out was excellent&mdash;from local councils, chambers of commerce, individuals and labour market providers. I believe that many organisations on the north coast would have registered an interest in participating in this scheme&mdash;voluntary organisations such as Apex or Rotary clubs, health care workers, Meals on Wheels and local charities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like to quote a couple of examples of the initial reaction when this scheme first came out. One editor wrote: Critics argue such schemes are simply exploitation of our young, but it is hard to see how anyone could be worse off working for the dole than sitting idly at home feeling worthless and depressed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Another comment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No doubt the detractors will be out in force condemning the proposal&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">the Labor Party&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">but if the programs work, our youth will be able to vote with their feet.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This quote is from a local in Murwillumbah, Andy Reeve:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It's a great idea. It will get people out of their rut and give them something to get up for in the morning. Trial it in the Tweed. Something has to be done in the Tweed Valley. There is too much unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And the quotes go on. But what is interesting is that since the initial announcement was made, a recent article by Paul Chamberlain in the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>  on 7 May notes that the work for the dole proposal has been given the biggest boost, with an influential survey
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> finding that three in five businesses would be more willing to employ someone with that experience.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Morgan and Banks job index survey of 3,200 employers noted that 57.6 per cent of employers would be more willing to hire someone who had worked for the dole, rather than someone who had simply been receiving unemployment benefits. The retail sector has been the strongest advocate for this, which is very pleasing because the retail sector is the largest employer in the country, particularly in Tweed Heads and Ballina. The other interesting point is that public opinion now is that over 70 per cent of the public support this idea, which makes you wonder why the ALP has been criticising it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the projects which I would like to see in our area&mdash;which have been proposed for Richmond&mdash;include the Caldera Track, a proposed 200&hyphen;kilometre walking track which will pass through four world heritage areas&mdash;a magnificent part of Australia. It is something which I would like to see achieved in my lifetime and could rival the Milford Track and the Appalachian Way. In other areas, perhaps we could see community projects such as the construction of cycle tracks in the shire, particularly around the Byron area, and the formalisation of a visitor centre at Stotts Island, which has a pristine native rainforest many hundreds of years old literally metres away from the Pacific Highway, separated by a narrow channel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the many charity organisations serving the very high aged population that we have, work for the dole could help provide basic care and also provide extra experience within the health industry. Other environmental groups are the local dunecare groups, of which I note there are three now working under a Green Corps project&mdash;Pottsville, Hastings Point and Fingal, to name a few. Of course, our biggest employer outside retailing, the tourism industry, would also benefit enormously from having these areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Looking at the background, when the Prime Minister made his announcement on 9 February it was aimed at 30,000 young people who were unemployed for six months or more. It is interesting to note, when you look back in
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3761"> history, particularly to the Depression years of the 1930s, that state and local governments provided a work for the dole scheme for hundreds of thousands of unemployed men through subsistence benefits. Indeed, many of the bush trails up Mount Warning, the highest mountain in Richmond, were built through one of these early schemes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similar schemes were proposed by the Hawke Labor government and also came through in the Fightback document of the Liberal and National parties in 1991, but none were implemented. One project which has been implemented, a work for the dole program which has been continually in operation since 1977, has been the community development employment program&mdash;better known as CDEP&mdash;which enables Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders to engage in community projects instead of receiving unemployment benefits. ATSIC pays these grants which are equal to the dole, plus oncosts and capital support. This has worked exceptionally well in these communities, particularly in my area at Cabbage Tree Island where, if it wasn't for the CDEP program, unemployment rates in these communities would be well over 90 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you look at other countries, even in the last more notable British campaign the Tories and Labour both had what they called a `workfare' plan&mdash;work for welfare. The Tories workfare pilot gave long&hyphen;term jobless 13 weeks help in finding a job. If the search was unsuccessful, 13 weeks of compulsory work followed. If the unemployed person refused to search for a job or take a compulsory one, their unemployment benefits would cease. The result of the pilot studies was that many people stopped claiming benefits once presented with these alternatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tony Blair has a workfare concept as well, under which he plans to offer around 200,000 people under the age of 25 and jobless a six&hyphen;month scheme offering a number of options, which is very similar to our work for the dole scheme. If you look at the United States, their welfare&hyphen;to&hyphen;work program as part of their job opportunities and basic skills program has worked very well in a number of states. In Iowa, a family investment program requires
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> most adult welfare recipients to work either full or part time to search for a job, to train or to study. There is a similar program in Utah.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is important to look at the coalition's wider perspectives in creating employment. One of them is the jobs pathway program, which will act in tandem with the work for the dole and acts as a bridge for students at their most vulnerable time&mdash;when they leave school. By providing a direct link from school straight into work, this government wants to stop unemployment before it begins. The new apprenticeship scheme is another example of a government which is recognising and responding to the needs of the labour market. Under the previous government, apprenticeship levels fell to the lowest level in 30 years. Taking on apprentices was overly bureaucratic and dominated by the Trades and Labour Council, which did not encourage apprenticeships in growth industries, resulting in a lack of skilled workers in some of the most rapidly emerging industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under this government, there will be substantial benefits given to take on traineeships. Over $265 million is included in this budget for over 100,000 new apprenticeships. Isn't it better to give people something longer than just a labour market program, where, after a number of years, they walk away with a trade and a skill? This is certainly encouraged by the 7,000 small business operators in the areas I represent&mdash;Tweed, Ballina, Murwillumbah and Byron Bay. The national apprenticeship scheme will provide a means to employ them, to put on a trainee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other area of expenditure in this budget geared towards providing skills for our young people to get better employment is $1.3 billion going to vocational training&mdash;the amount of money going into TAFE&mdash;and, most importantly, the amount of money going back into education for the improvement of literacy skills, to give young people the basic life skills so that they can go out into the labour market, be attractive and be taken up. This was not recognised by the previous government.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3762">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another area is the small business package. This should not be underestimated. Over the last 12 months, the removal of the unfair dismissal law, the changes in the capital gains tax and the cutting back on red tape have provided an impetus for small businesses to take on someone.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="MARTIN" NAMEID="8I4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The feeling I get around my area, which the member should listen to, is that when capital gains tax legislation is introduced it will allow those businesses to upgrade. Indeed, with the new unfair dismissal laws, many of them now are feeling a lot more comfortable about taking on extra staff.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Seeing that we have had some comments from the ALP, I would like to look back at the ALP's track record on their labour market programs. When Working Nation was introduced&mdash;and perhaps it was introduced with the best intent&mdash;in the six years from July 1990 to March 1996 Labor's policies added only 7,100 additional full&hyphen;time jobs. One particular DEETYA report on labour market programs found that programs like the new work opportunities program effectively resulted in four per cent of participants gaining work, at a cost of $143,000 for each additional job. That record is disgraceful, and I am curious that these sorts of figures were not published by the department. Surely DEETYA were doing this kind of research when the ALP were in power. Did previous ALP DEETYA ministers, including Kim Beazley, simply ignore the research of their own department?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former left&hyphen;wing member for Richmond, Neville Newell, is on record in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 31 May 1995&mdash;one of the few occasions when he spoke&mdash;as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The effort that has been made to create jobs through the new work opportunities has been commendable . . . </PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I could think of 143,000 reasons why he and the ALP were so out of touch with commercial reality&mdash;one being wasting taxpayers' money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one simple reason why the ALP continued to pour millions of dollars into many of their ineffective labour market
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> programs. Not all the programs were, I acknowledge that, but a lot of them were to buy votes. It is unfortunate that many unemployed people were given access to these training schemes without the prospect of real jobs at the end. I do hope that the Labor Party will not in the winter recess attempt to ambush this legislation in the Senate, in which case it may not get up or could be delayed beyond September when the first pilot program is meant to begin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The work for the dole budget in 1997 is an allocation of $21.6 million. There is $15.5 million for up to 70 community based pilot projects for 10,000 participants throughout Australia for 12 months. The remaining $6.1 million will cover administration, monitoring and assessment of the initiative. The $15.5 million includes $12.4 million to community organisations to run the projects, around $520,000 for child-care costs for participants and over $2.5 million for that extra $10 a week for travelling expenses to allow those unemployed people to actually get to their project. It is a good scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last point I would like to touch on is youth suicide, which should be bipartisan and go beyond the politics that happen in this chamber and the other chamber. Unemployment is seen as one of the major factors contributing to the shameful level of youth suicide. In 1993 our youth suicide rate per 100,000 was 23.7 for males and 3.7 for females. This level is amongst the world's worst and is simply unacceptable. By giving young people something worth while to do with their time&mdash;it is not seen as a panacea&mdash;the work for the dole scheme may just break that unemployment cycle. Unemployment goes hand in hand with loss of self&hyphen;esteem and of motivation and often leads to high levels of depression and family break&hyphen;ups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note with interest the comments made in my local media by a psychology lecturer at Southern Cross University when this policy was announced in February. The lecturer stated that the work for the dole scheme could reduce youth suicide on the far north coast. The media often reports our high levels of youth suicide but seldom accompanies the statistics with constructive solutions to the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3763"> problem. If the work for the dole scheme can reduce the risk of youth suicide just by one, it is definitely worthy of this parliament's wholehearted support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, the work for the dole scheme is a positive initiative. It goes hand in glove with the other government programs for addressing unemployment. Traineeships get a massive boost. This gets away from the six&hyphen;month programs which dominated the previous government's approach. Policies to assist small business&mdash;theirs is still a waiting game&mdash;will make them feel more confident so that they can put on more staff, not fearful of draconian industrial legislation and able to have the benefit of making some profit. Other areas addressed include vocational training, education, better life skills and, of course, overall having better fiscal management of the country to allow the private sector to flourish so that it can start to tackle that enormous social problem&mdash;it is not just an economic problem&mdash;of unemployment. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In preparing for this debate on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Work for the Dole) Bill 1997 last session, I proposed to open my remarks by asking this question: what happened to the quest for real jobs? What happened to the quest for real, meaningful, sustainable jobs? Mr Deputy Speaker, I think you would allow me to put this in the context of the opening week of this session, where on Tuesday night we saw the bringing down of the government's budget. Even more, that question should be emphasised: what has happened to the quest for real jobs?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An analysis of the forecasts within the budget brought down by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) on Tuesday night shows that at the end of the next financial year the government expects unemployment to be at a level of eight per cent. If we look at their forecasts for  the present financial year, one has to doubt their ability to correctly forecast the figure at the end of next financial year, because at the time of the budget last August the prediction was that unemployment would track down to a level of 8.25 per cent. This was subsequently amended by the Treasurer to a level of 8.5
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> per cent. What is the level of unemployment in Australia at the moment? It is 8.7 per cent. So can we realistically depend on the types of forecasts that are contained in the budget?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a more real sense, if we look at the context of this piece of legislation, in the explanatory memorandum it correctly says that this legislation grew out of an announcement by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in February this year. The announcement was made on a television show at a time when the government was receiving great criticism about the behaviour of senior members of the government. It was seen, I think quite correctly, as a decision that was put forward as a distraction to the real issues that obtained at that time and, in a way, continue to obtain now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is typical of the `developing' nature of the policies being made by this government: it is an illustration of a decision being made on the run. Somebody's good idea was plucked from thin air, announced outside of this place and then the Prime Minister asked his ministers to rush off and try to figure out how these things could be put into place. It was an idea that was not thought through and an idea without much substance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regrettably, this is not the only example that we have of this type of policy decision making on the run. A number of the decisions made in the areas of employment and labour market programs are of the same ilk. During the non&hyphen;sitting period between these two sessions we had the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) deciding that it might be a good idea to reward schools for placing people into jobs. These claims were made on the basis of some of the work done under the pathways program at a school somewhere in Queensland that they think is a great idea. But it does not seem to underscore and acknowledge the work that schools, through careers teachers, already do. It does not acknowledge that the schools did that with the cooperation of the Commonwealth Employment Service. It does not acknowledge that the real need to even be suggesting such a scheme is because the CES is to be abolished. Again, it was something that was plucked out of the air&mdash;a decision
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3764"> apparently made on the run. Regrettably, these ideas are strewn like confetti across the political landscape, where there appears to be little thought.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday&mdash;and I acknowledge this is an unrelated matter&mdash;we had the Prime Minister developing a position on the run about the optional nature, perhaps, of the taxation rebate on savings. I offer that as an illustration of the way in which either in real terms&mdash;and that is the position I am putting&mdash;but, at the most charitable, in the perception stakes, this government appears to be continuing to make policies on the run. Perhaps these are somebody's ideas that occur to them in the morning when they get up, before they sit down to brekkie. Whatever the case, the policies are not based on thinking both the issues and the outcomes through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this case, we have a piece of legislation which, right from the title of the bill, sets the scene and the flavour for the legislation. We have a government that, in opposition, continually denigrated the programs that we had under Working Nation, such as LEAP, because they would supposedly not provide real jobs. We were told that it was unfair on the unemployed to have them participating in these schemes because, under some definition, the then opposition and now government felt they were not meaningful. What happens? The government is elected and Working Nation is smashed, not for any real reason bar the underlying ideological preferences of the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now they sit there and chant the mantra, `Let the marketplace create jobs. Let the unemployed look after themselves.' Indeed, this seems to exemplify the overall thinking of the government. Take a look at this week's budget. There is not too much, just a few smokescreens that try to attract a few headlines because of superficial criticism. Now, a couple of days later when there is detailed  analysis of these policies, everything is falling apart. At least we are seeing some fair dinkum criticism of this year's budget, unlike the way the media, in a flim&hyphen;flam way, looked at last year's budget.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most clearly, from the budget and from the speech of the Treasurer, one year down the track the government has admitted that it has failed to create jobs. It has failed to address the single most important issue that confronts Australia&mdash;unemployment. We know that they recognise that they have failed because one of the best things they have to offer&mdash;well, they claim it is a good thing&mdash;is this piece of legislation. Even before their much heralded employment service market has been put out to tender, they know they have failed and they have had to come up with something else to be seen to be doing something for the unemployed. What they have done with this piece of legislation tells us a lot about them and the mealy&hyphen;mouthed ideas that fill their heads.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead of reintroducing labour market programs to provide the unemployed with training and support while they get work experience, now the unemployed are to be dragooned into a scheme that simply requires them to work. This is clothed in the language of reciprocal obligation; but, of course, this is a deliberate con. No&hyphen;one in the opposition is against the idea of reciprocal obligation; Working Nation was based on the idea of reciprocal obligation. But, while borrowing the language of reciprocal obligation in Working Nation, this scheme is based on a far more pernicious concept&mdash;punishment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst I acknowledge the comments of the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Anthony) in concluding his speech, when he talked about youth suicide and the fact that employment brings young people a degree of much needed self&hyphen;esteem, the negative nature of this program is not the type of signal that should be sent out to young people. It is not a matter of saying to the unemployed, `If we train you, give you work experience and assist you in identifying a vacancy then you have a reciprocal obligation to take that vacancy.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was the core of Working Nation&mdash;the notion that each party to the job compact had obligations. This program is about saying to unemployed youth, `You owe us. To receive your income support from the social security system you must earn it. Our only obligation as a nation is to pay you. We don't owe you
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3765"> a real job. We don't owe you training and job search assistance and other support which has been part of our social security net for many years. You, the unemployed, owe us.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a fundamental shift in social policy in this country. It is a change from the notion that income support is owed by society to individuals as compensation for the failure of the labour market to the notion that individuals owe a debt to society for income received during the time that they are unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I acknowledge that this might have some short&hyphen;term appeal to the pollsters; it might have appeal to the Ray Martin set. But this decision will come back to haunt this government. It is appalling that a term that carries with it such negative and derogatory connotations as `dole' should actually be included in the title of the legislation. What signal does it really send out to the people that are on unemployment benefits? More than anything else, this reveals the agenda for the government: we cannot fix unemployment so we will blame the victims, stigmatise the unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The one small positive thing to emerge from this shabby debate is that it puts into perspective how pitiful the level of income support is if it can be worked out in only 15 hours. The opposition has an 11-point plan which details the minimum criteria for acceptable labour market programs. The first and most important of these points is that no scheme should displace the jobs of existing workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sadly, many unscrupulous employers may seek to take advantage of the government's proposal unless adequate safeguards are in place. In fact, the day after the Prime Minister made his work for the dole announcement&mdash;done without the knowledge of appropriate ministers&mdash;anecdotal evidence from my electorate suggested that some employers were already intending rorts. My office told me of an example of a factory owner who said, `I'm not putting anybody on. I'm going  to sack 10 and put on 16 from the work for the dole scheme.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Hopefully, measures that will be taken in administering this scheme will prevent em
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ployers from doing this. But, again, this is a notion of the signals this idea puts into people's minds. The government must ensure that employers do not act to dismiss people on the false premise that they can get a couple of young unemployed kids to do their jobs. Yet, there is nothing in the second reading speech of the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training to indicate that this type of rort will be prevented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other points in the opposition's criteria include the provision of training in any of these schemes. This legislation provides no obligation on the part of any prospective employer to provide those in his or her charge with on- or off-the-job training. The government attacked Working Nation labour market programs on the basis that they did not lead to real jobs but simply churned unemployed people from training scheme to training scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what does the work for the dole scheme do? It does not even ensure that participants learn anything during their time on the program. Whilst it heralds that they will learn a form of work ethic in that they will have to turn up, some of these people, especially as they will be people unemployed for over six months, need a lot of support in the run-up to them being able to develop that work ethic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This scheme is simply about filling in the unemployed person's time on the grounds that they owe the government for their unemployment benefits and should be punished accordingly. It does not ensure that there will be jobs available at the end of the scheme for those who have participated in it. Therefore, the opposition has called upon the government that in this work for the dole program the government force participating organisations to state up&hyphen;front the proportion of participants who will receive permanent employment after the placement. Any further contracts with the government to provide services under the scheme should only be based on the participating organisation's performance against this figure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another worrying feature of the proposed scheme is that the relationship between the unemployed participant and the participating organisations is not clearly defined. What

If this is to be fair dinkum work experience, those matters have to be addressed. Yet, the participants are to be exempted from all of these requirements of this type of legislation. Perhaps the most damaging comment about the work for the dole scheme comes from the minister's own second reading speech, in which he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government recognises that the work for the dole initiative is not a solution to youth unemployment and has not represented it as such.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What a damning indictment of this whole sorry episode. The minister admits that this will do absolutely nothing to alleviate youth unemployment and that this was never the intention of the scheme. By his own words, the minister confirms the suspicion that this scheme is all about punishing the unemployed for being unemployed. It is not about jobs for the unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to raise on that point one of the farragoes that surrounds the Green Corps program. During the election campaign, this was offered as something that was to be aimed at providing labour market programs for unemployed youth. But that has now been denied and we are told that Green Corps is an environmental program. In conclusion, I suggest that members of the House look at the budget related paper to do with the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs where, under student youth support, it says that the Green Corps programs involve young people in protecting and restoring Australia's natural heritage. But it is under the heading of a support scheme as a labour market program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition has great concerns about this piece of legislation, which we have outlined in this second reading debate. I hope that the government will carefully reconsider this policy and come up with things that are more concrete to enable people who are unemployed at present to re&hyphen;enter the labour force as quickly as possible.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before participating directly in this debate on the proposed work for the dole scheme, I
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> would like to pick up a point or two made by the member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins). As all members in this chamber know, I have a high regard for the member for Scullin, as I believe most members do. But he drew a very long bow in his introductory remarks when he suggested that we should question the whole work for the dole proposal on the basis of the statistics run in Tuesday night's budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Scullin was critical of all statisticians on the grounds that a difference between an 8.7 per cent and 8.5 per cent projected unemployment rate somehow indicated a remarkably loose use of figures. What the chamber should be considering is this underlying truth about unemployment: the figure of 8.7 per cent is better than once it was and if the  Treasurer (Mr Costello) is right and the government achieves an eight per cent figure&mdash;not all that remarkable&mdash;it will be the best figure, albeit, I freely concede to the member for Scullin, not good enough, since 1990. That is the best figure after six years of the previous government's various job creation schemes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, far from being critical of the work for the dole proposal, the opposition ought to see this proposal for just what it is. Opposition speakers have suggested that this was the only suggestion that this government was offering to the unemployed, that this was the only technique that we had to help people back into the work force. Instead of that, it is one of a segment of ideas that we are putting to the unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real solution to unemployment, as parliamentary members&mdash;not government or opposition&mdash;know, is the creation of what the member for Scullin has called `real jobs', a term somewhat derisively observed by the member for Denison (Mr Kerr), as the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) was here to attest. But I pick up the member for Scullin's term. I know what he means by `real jobs' and I know what I mean by `real jobs'. I know that real jobs are created when the marketplace believes there is an opportunity to employ people and to employ them productively. So the obligation the parliament has is to cultivate a marketplace that will put on people in order to be more productive. Frank
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3767"> ly, the task of the government is to build a marketplace in which employers want to engage employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not doubt that the previous government had a similar objective, but their task at national economic renewal failed abysmally, so unemployment remained for them and for the parliament something of an embarrassment. We are serious about national economic renewal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Denison had much to say, much of it critical, about all of the government's proposals. He said, `Look at all of the cuts that the Howard government has made.' It is as if we had a choice about it, as if cuts were something we loved doing, as if we were desperate to see any area of government expenditure and pluck it out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality, Mr Deputy Speaker, as you well know, is that all of the cuts that the Howard government has been forced to make it has been forced to make because of the budget deficit. The Treasurer has every right to be proud of the fact that in one term he will have taken a budget deficit of $10 billion&mdash;I am the first to concede, should the member for Scullin want some reassurance, that it is not the first time that there has been a budget deficit&mdash;and turn it into a budget surplus. That is good news for the unemployed, but it is not the impression you get from opposition members participating in this debate. All of the cuts that have occurred have occurred in order to generate a budget surplus, because the alternative to that was to jack up income tax, payroll tax, company tax, excise and other rates, which would, of course, be further damaging to economic recovery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let it be clearly understood. In the work for the dole program the government does not say to those who are unemployed, `You owe us, so you should be working.' There is a sense of reciprocation that the member for Scullin has referred to, but in reality the government says to the unemployed, `If you're a young person, unemployed for an extended period of time, you're in danger of getting into an  unemployed mentality, and we want you to experience what work is about.' The work for the dole program is all about giving unem
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ployed young people an opportunity to discover what work is all about. Work is not something we seek to avoid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was once&mdash;and I know very little about it&mdash;a philosophy around called the Protestant work ethic. There was this understanding that because people had not been asked to be born and discovered themselves here with various talents, they wanted an opportunity to use those talents as part of a community. That is roughly my understanding of the Protestant work ethic.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hasten to reassure the parliamentary secretary at the table that I am sure this is not a uniquely Protestant philosophy at all; it is understood by a number of people, including him. My point about the Protestant work ethic is as follows. People discovered that it was not a matter of being paid or how much you were earning; it was a chance to feel that you had a role in the community that was important if life was to be fulfilling.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The work for the dole scheme allows unemployed young people to discover that they have a role in the community and that they have talents and attributes that the community can use. You do not need a work for the dole scheme to do that, you would think, except that, sadly, if it was automatic, we would have every volunteer organisation in Australia swamped by unemployed people right now. The reality is that those unemployed people in my electorate who have been unemployed for some period of time are not rushing into volunteer organisations. They are not rushing in to discover what it is to be a participant in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This scheme gives people an opportunity to discover what work is about&mdash;to discover what it is to be part of the community and accepted in the community because you are making a contribution. It is not a matter of the government saying, `You owe us.' It is a matter of the government saying, `We would do you a gross disservice if we did not give you the opportunity to discover just what work is about and how work makes life more fulfilling. There is a mutual obligation and
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3768"> there is an opportunity through this scheme to put something back, but there is more than that. There is the chance for individuals to discover what they are about and what sort of status they may discover.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Cunningham, in his remarks on this debate, made the point that the government had been guilty of research and development cuts, much the same point as has been made by the member for Scullin and other speakers who have been critical of the budget. I put this point to the member for Cunningham: as I said in my opening remarks&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="PRICE" NAMEID="QI4">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HE4">Mr ANDREW</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will gladly respond to the member for Chifley as well. The cuts that the government has made have been made out of an obligation to balance the budget. I regret that there is not more money available for R&amp;D, a sentiment I share with the member for Cunningham. But the government has felt an obligation to balance the budget. This particular scheme is a scheme that, with minimal outlays, allows the government to let unemployed young people discover what work is about and how they can be participants in the community as it is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are told that over one-third of employers say that participation in the scheme will make little difference to the employability of the individuals, but two-thirds of the employers say that it will make a difference and that they would be keen to employ young people who have been participants in this scheme. As a result of being in the scheme, they see young people as being more employable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I noticed that in relation to this the member for Scullin made the point that the ALP felt that there should be an 11 point plan in place before they can endorse the work for the dole scheme. One of those 11 points was an obligation on these employers to state how many permanent people they would put on as a result of this scheme. No-one who has been an employer could possibly conceive such an absurd plan.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you; he has made it even more colourful. In order to help the member for Chifley, the member for Scullin made the point that he believed that one of his employers would be prepared to sack 10 people if he could put on 16 under the work for the dole arrangement. Of course, that is nonsense. There is no proposal under this scheme that allows employers to suck people out of the unemployed reservoir and put them into permanent jobs. Once they are in permanent jobs, they have the same obligations as all other full-time employees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This scheme gives young unemployed people the opportunity to discover what the discipline and the rewards of the workplace are all about. The suggestion that it will in some way take unemployed people and have them replace those already in work is a matter that has already been addressed by the minister when he introduced this very scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Previous speakers have also made much of what they have seen as the work for the dole scheme: simply getting people involved in menial tasks. As most people in the parliament know after 14 years, before coming into this place I employed people in menial tasks, principally fruit picking. If there is one thing that I really resent participating in debate in this chamber it is the emphasis on so-called menial tasks, as if to be the cleaner in the House of Representatives was some task that ought to be dismissed relative to being a member. The facts are that we need Australians who discover how menial tasks, so-called&mdash;as I said, I am dismissive of the term&mdash;can be rewarding and how there is an opportunity to feel that the skills and the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3769"> talents you have are being used as part of the community, whether your role is as an MP or a cleaner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One should not be dismissed for merely carrying out a menial task. I do not see the work for the dole scheme as being something that engages people in so-called menial tasks; I see the work for the dole scheme as being something that allows people to discover what work is about and how there can be a real sense of reward in participating in the community and allowing your talents to be used to the advantage of the community in total.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not a scheme about which the government should make any apology. It is a scheme that has clearly been well received by the electorate at large. It is a scheme that allows unemployed young people to participate in the community. That is why it is in place. To pick up the concluding remarks of the member for Richmond (Mr Anthony), it is a scheme that allows young people to feel a greater sense of self&hyphen;esteem because they have a role in the community, and the tragedy of youth suicide is best addressed by allowing young people to feel that they have a role and that they are needed and wanted by the community at large. Far from being dismissive of the scheme, we ought to be giving it a shot, because nothing else has worked thus far.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to speak on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Work for the Dole) Bill 1997. I will pick up a couple of the points made by my colleague opposite, the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew). He said that working for the dole is popular. I, for one, would not contest that, but the better question to ask the people of Australia is: do you think that every Australian who wants to should be able to have meaningful work? I think we would get an overwhelmingly strong and positive answer to that. Neither the previous government nor the current government&mdash;perhaps much less, the current government&mdash;has been able to fulfil that overwhelming desire for work for all Australians, particularly those who are unemployed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue of youth suicide has been raised in this debate on several instances. We should not avoid it, but the issues underlying our extraordinarily and unacceptably high youth suicide rate are multifaceted. I do not believe that, regrettably, there is a single&hyphen;shot solution. Without doubt, there are two main reasons for youth suicide. The despair of the individual is one of the leading causes. Ironically, relationship problems is the other main causal factor. However, our unacceptably high unemployment rate is no doubt also a significant contributor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was interesting that at the last election the Labor government&mdash;and you would expect that of the Australian Labor Party&mdash;was concerned to get unemployment down. We did something that was perhaps foolish for a government to do. We said that, by the year 2000, we believed we could get unemployment down to five per cent. I say it was foolish because, whenever governments set a target, if they meet the target, people say that it was probably too easy; if they exceed it, they say it was certainly too easy; and if they fail, then they say it is just another failure of government. However, in government, like any other form of organisational activity, we need to set targets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said that he wanted Australians to feel relaxed and comfortable. I suppose that applied to the unemployed, including the long&hyphen;term unemployed. I do not think they are feeling too relaxed and comfortable at the moment, especially as the long&hyphen;term unemployment figures trend up. The government has said to institutions like the Reserve Bank, `Do away with your priority about unemployment. Our primary concern as a government is inflation. We don't want you to have a matching or equally high concern about unemployment' or `Unemployment is an acceptable feature of our modern existence. Ignore that, but crunch down on inflation.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I did a poll of the people of Australia at large and asked, `Would you be prepared to have a slightly higher inflationary figure in the economy if we could really crunch down on unemployment and get it significantly lower?' I think that, overwhelmingly, they
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3770"> would say, `Yes, we are really concerned about unemployment. Our current high level of unemployment is not an attractive feature of Australia.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am trying to say that the coalition came to office and, in government, has demonstrated a lack of commitment&mdash;if not in the medium to long term, certainly in the short term&mdash;to doing anything about unemployment. We now have the work for the dole scheme. Mr Deputy Speaker, I need to remind you and the government that one of the first actions of the Howard government was actually to cut out funding for 117,000 training positions for the unemployed. In a sense, we are replacing them with the 10,000 positions to pilot work for the dole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would not say to you that every proposition or scheme that we developed in trying to get people job ready was an outstanding success, but overall they were successful. There is no disputing the evidence that the more you put into training, the better chance you will have of individuals getting a job. The modern dilemma that we have in Australia&mdash;and in fact in other economies&mdash;is that, if you do not do anything, particularly with the long&hyphen;term unemployed, you will have an overhang of long&hyphen;term unemployed. As your economy picks up, you will pick up the new school leavers and those re&hyphen;entering the work force but you will also have an overhang of long&hyphen;term unemployed. I notice that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Mr Abbott) is at the table. I would be surprised if he were comforted by the fact that the numbers of long&hyphen;term unemployed are increasing. That is a blight on our society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to get back to the topic of work for the dole. If we meet someone in the corridor or out in our electorates or what have you, apart from the first pleasantries, we will usually ask, `What do you do?' We credential ourselves by our activity. I can say that I am a member of parliament or that, in my previous occupations, I worked for Telecom, was a labourer with the water board, was a fencer and worked on a poultry farm. I can say&mdash;or could have said in the past&mdash;all of these things to credential myself. But what do
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> unemployed people do? What activity do they own up to? They say, `I am unemployed.' It is like putting a black mark on yourself straightaway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It really does not come as a surprise to me that, amongst the unemployed, some are quite enthusiastic about working for the dole. It actually credentials them with an activity. It puts them at least almost on a par with other people in the community. I do not think any of us in this chamber have been through the frustration of seeing jobs advertised, applying for them when they are filled, having the application be one of 100 or one of several hundred and not even getting an acknowledgment that the application was received, let alone being short&hyphen;listed. We in this illustrious chamber, the House of Representatives of the Australian parliament, have not been through that frustration. Even though I believe the scheme has flaws, I can understand that some young unemployed people would say, `Get me out of this; at least I can do some activity that will credential me along with other Australians in the community.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what is it really doing? As I started off by saying, what we want for all of our fellow Australians, whether they be young or middle aged, is that they have work&mdash;a meaningful job. As a government, as a community and as a society, we are not delivering that. How do 10,000 of these jobs stack up against the 117,000 positions that the Howard government has already cut out of the training programs that we had in place? Unfortunately, the scheme does not necessarily mean that any one of those 10,000 is actually going to be more job ready. Yes, there is the discipline of getting up and, yes, there is the motivation associated with the work&mdash;there are those pluses&mdash;but, unlike a training program, it is not going to get any of them more job ready.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If any government members have any knowledge of some of the more difficult, long&hyphen;term unemployed cases, then they know that this sort of work for the dole falls well short of the mark. I think it is preposterous to say, `We have cut out 117,000 places, we'll replace them with 10,000 places, and somehow we are affecting the suicide rate of young Australians.'</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3771">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a Labor politician, I have always believed fervently that a primary responsibility of a government is to set the preconditions for full employment, knowing that that is a tough objective and knowing that it is not easy to achieve. I have always passionately believed that. However, even the most optimistic forecast by the Governor of the Reserve Bank suggests that we are going to have six per cent unemployed by the turn of the century, and in my electorate that would be much higher. I notice that we have incorporated the 11 points that we believe make this scheme much more acceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the Labor Party side, yes, we should not lose our passion and commitment to training, to getting people job ready, but we also need to face up to the reality that too many of our fellow Australians are not going to get a job. How are we going to ensure that they have self-esteem, that they have dignity, and that they have self-worth? I believe we are well short of developing a policy towards that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I really was stung the other day by a comment from the St Vincent de Paul Society&mdash;and, by inference, Cardinal Clancy, who endorsed the work of the society&mdash;that Mount Druitt was a sinkhole of welfare. As the elected representative of the poor of my electorate, I was incensed that such a comment should be made. It really did make me think about how welfare dependent we are making some people and how we are removing self-esteem, self-worth, and not replacing the sense of despair and sense of hopelessness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because debate is being curtailed on this legislation, let me say quickly that I would always applaud things the government does towards helping the unemployed. I understand why work for the dole is a popular notion in our society, but I need to reiterate my belief that it is a poor substitute for decent and meaningful work for all of our fellow Australians. Work for the dole is not going to do much for those 10,000 who are on the pilot program, and 10,000 positions is a miserable dividend when you have cut away 117,000 positions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last but not least, let me say that we in the Labor Party, without abandoning our beliefs
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in investment, in industry policy, in encouraging job growth and in having the reduction of unemployment as a very high priority in society, need to come to grips with whatever the percentage is who will remain unemployed, whether it is three per cent, four per cent or five per cent. Whatever the percentage is, these people should not be considered to be second-class Australians. These people are entitled, as I am, and as you are, Mr Deputy Speaker, to the notion of self-esteem, self-worth, dignity and being meaningfully involved in our society. The Labor Party in that regard still has a long way to go to deal with that issue.</PARA></SPEECH>

However, before I do so I must say that it was interesting to hear the member for Chifley (Mr Price) say they were well on the way to developing a policy to help the unemployed. They had 13 years to do it!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I heard this morning the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), who is currently leaving the chamber, say that this work for the dole scheme is nothing but a bandaid solution. That means, to me, that all the programs of the previous government, over their years on the government benches, could not come to grips with the problem. Maybe one could say that the bandaid solutions were simply theirs. What we are seeing here today, and what we are debating in this legislation for work for the dole, is not a bandaid solution. It is a real solution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am surprised that the opposition derides the work for the dole scheme. The feedback I have had from my electorate indicates that it certainly has the community's support. I have already had submissions from local community groups and associations offering work and training for the work for the dole scheme and for the participants that we propose to put into the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe one of the most devastating results of unemployment is the loss of the work ethic. We are now seeing a phenomenon of young adults who left school, went straight on the dole and have never worked. They have
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3772"> no work ethic to even relate to. This, I believe, is the direct legacy of Labor's social program which created a welfare culture and a generation of Australians who have been socially manipulated to their detriment. We know that not only do long periods of unemployment lead to a loss of motivation and a desire to seek work but vital training time is also lost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A cry I hear often from young adults is that employers offer jobs for which they do not have the skills. There is no doubt that the unskilled labour market is shrinking. But this does not mean that the job market is shrinking; it means that it is changing form. We cannot hope to compete with the cheap labour force available in other parts of the world, but we can compete in other growing markets, such as technology, science and the service industries. Today, for the first time, companies are including in their assets the skills of their individual employees. They are no longer looking at staff as a necessary adjunct of business but as the vital core of their business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Young people play a vital role in our work force, but I believe we must redirect their focus. For example, let us consider the ordinary, everyday work skill of typing. Once, only young women learned to type and typing skills led them into the work force as receptionists, clerks and secretaries. Typing was a vital skill for women. I can remember when a young man was considered a bit sissy if he took up typing. Today, touch&hyphen;typing skills are just as necessary for men and women, and computer technology means efficient typing skills are necessary at both junior and senior levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just as learning to touch&hyphen;type is not a difficult task, neither is learning a computer program. No longer does the ability to type place a worker straight into the old typing pool or at the reception desk but into all aspects of business and trade. I believe it is vital that we get young people out of the mind&hyphen;set that women type and men drive trucks. Their skills and potential skills might not be evident, not even to themselves. Therefore, programs such as work for the dole are a way to enforce this awareness.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our young people have been deceived for more than a decade by a Labor government that created training programs which did not lead to jobs. Instead, most led straight back to the dole queue. Young people believe the previous government was concerned, but the figures show only a facade, even worse&mdash;a farce.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are creating systems which prove there are jobs for young people. The school to work program has already shown that it can be done. Working on the principle that schools are well placed to build a bridge for students from the classroom to the work force, a pilot program was established in my city of Brisbane. The first results have been more than impressive. Both Marsden and Acacia Ridge state high schools bid for the government contract to find jobs for their school leavers. Since January, Marsden has found work for 147 teenagers and Acacia Ridge, which came into the program a little later, has already placed 30 students in jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So much for Peter Baldwin's statement to the House in March that work for the dole was a `pathetic mickey mouse scheme'. We have already shown it is possible to break the start of that deadly pattern of classroom to the dole queue. We are doing what the opposition said was not possible under our programs: we are already putting young people in jobs. Our jobs pathway strategy does not start and end with work for the dole or the school to work program. While both break the system of leave school, go on the dole, do a training course, go back on the dole, they are just the beginning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The CES, the government agency around which so many young lives revolve, is to be restructured. The CES will no longer be a pure bureaucratic government agency but one that has to compete with the private sector in the job finding business.

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3773"> ed or due as a right', whereas the word `dole' is described in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Webster's Dictionary</EMPHASIS> as `a government payment to the unemployed and also the distribution of money to the needy'. There is a big difference in attitude created by these phrases. Not many people like to feel they are given money because they are needy. Certainly not when they are young, healthy and able to work, given the incentive and the right pathway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A decade ago I would have considered it unusual to be talking with young adults of 26 years of age who have never had a long&hyphen;term full&hyphen;time job, let alone a couple with a newborn baby. This couple, whom I know well, both live on government welfare, and neither have ever seriously considered seeking anything other than part&hyphen;time work. Now in their mid&hyphen;20s, it is doubtful they realise just how many years of vital training they have lost. We know, with the benefit of hindsight, it is unlikely they will be taken seriously by an employer looking for senior staff. These young adults are not lazy, nor do they enjoy living on the dole. But their lifestyle has developed to include a great deal of leisure time and the pursuit of hobbies which they find emotionally and physically fulfilling and rewarding. It is not surprising at their age when they apply for jobs that the salary, commensurate with their skills or their limited range of skills, is geared for a jobstarter not a mature age adult.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is like trying to teach an adult to read using kindergarten primers. Boredom tends to set in quickly and job changing has become the career path of the young. Therefore, I believe any scheme or program which gives the unemployed the chance to gain from constructive effort is of great value. The work for the dole scheme is one such scheme. With wise placement, young people will find themselves working in fields they may never have considered a potential career path&mdash;the environment, for example. This is an area which has been erroneously considered the domain of the greenies. The environment, which has many facets, is an industry where many specialists work alongside community groups. These are the types of projects I believe are perfect for work for the dole
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> participants: working alongside specialists and gaining knowledge which is of value to society and therefore to an employer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The work the for dole program has been carefully considered. The ultimate aim is employment for young people. The previous government said a great deal and congratulated itself on programs while more and more young people fell by the wayside. This government recognises the need to change the way we as a society must act to help those who have difficulty in finding work. Work for the dole is a positive part of our jobs pathway. Work for the dole is just one step and leads ultimately to an improved apprenticeship or job training system. As it is an active work program, any participant who has a child or children will be able to place that child in government funded care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I support this bill because I know it is imperative we remind our young people that they are of value. We need to remind them that they are a vital part of our community, help them become an integral part of a team and, ultimately, assist them acquire skills which they can utilise in the workplace. Voltaire summed up the situation in one sentence: `Work keeps at bay three great evils, boredom, vice and need.' Australia will be an even greater country when we see our young people off the dole queues and living fulfilling lives. This is just one reason why I give this bill my wholehearted support.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset, let me say that I believe the subtitle of this particular piece of legislation&mdash;work for the dole&mdash;is highly derogatory. It is a name that we have given something which is trying to arrest a problem that I do not believe that either party has got a handle on. In fact, many of the major economies around the world are struggling with huge unemployment problems, particularly in the area of youth unemployment. In the second reading speech of the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) to promote this bill, he said that the value of the work for the dole initiative lies in bringing young unemployed people back into a work culture to help instil a positive attitude to work and that it will give young people a chance to engage with
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3774"> the community rather than being alienated from it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those are very worthwhile sentiments expressed there but, having said that, I am afraid that the philosophy of this bill has gone somewhere off the track because later in the House I heard the minister refer to `these people' and that they had certain obligations to the community. When we have 28 per cent of 15&hyphen; to 19&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds unemployed in the western area of New South Wales, when we have 30 per cent of youth unemployment state&hyphen;wide, I wonder whether we should, as those statements imply, be suggesting that it is their problem and not ours. It is our problem to generate jobs for the youth of this country and for those who have been put off by the downsizing of industry, by the lack of an industry policy and by the exporting of jobs because of our inability to compete.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We cannot blame. We cannot say that people are going to sit back in their houses, lie in the bed and watch the television all day. There may be, and there always will be, a percentage of people who may not wish to work. But I think that it is basic to our instinct that we be rewarded and recognised for a job well done at the end of the day. There are hundreds of thousands of people&mdash;1&half; million, probably&mdash;out there who are crying out for some participation in the work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have structural unemployment. Once upon a time we used to have people we called labourers&mdash;the working class, if you like. They were people who left school at a young age&mdash;sometimes, like my father, at 14&mdash;and went out into the work force. There were jobs there. There were processing jobs, jobs in industry and jobs in the mines. But now many of those jobs have been taken away by technology. They have also been taken away by the fact that labour is cheaper offshore than it is in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whose fault is that? We cannot just stand here for ever and a day blaming the union movement and the wage structure that we have developed in this country, because that very wage structure is a sign of our very prosperity. It is a prosperity that people in this country have come to expect and we cannot
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> stand here and blame the person who is laid off for being the cause of their own problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We now have 20 hours work regarded as full employment. We have one hour regarded as a person being employed. We have a huge underemployment problem in this country, quite apart from our unemployment problem. We must tackle the problem in a far more creative way than this social security amendment. I do not wish to refer to it as work for the dole. As I said, it is derogatory of those out there who have been rebuffed five, six, 10 or 12 times. How would any of us feel if we had that sort of rejection? We want reward for effort put in and we must find a more creative way of putting these people to work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The economic policies of both sides of politics in this country have been largely responsible for the situation we are now confronted with. Downsizing, rationalisation, privatisation, Telstra, Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank alone have created a situation where thousands of jobs have been or will be lost, and they will not be replaced. We have highly skilled people as well being laid off in the prime of their lives unable in many cases to contribute. Corporatisation is the precursor to privatisation. There was the ADI factory experience in my own electorate where something like 1,100 jobs have been reduced to 120 at best in the last few years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What have we seen in the last few days but the Carr Labor government awarding a pistol contract overseas when it could have been done locally and a very competitive product could have been turned out locally. But no, we export the jobs and we import the product. What sense is there in that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I support the concept of work for the dole. I support the concept of people having meaningful work three days a week over three years, but there must be a training component in it. There is no mention of the training component in this bill at all, yet I would refer you to the original interview that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) gave on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program back in February when he was asked by Laurie Oakes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What sort of work will they do? Are we talking about painting park benches?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The answer from the Prime Minister was:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3775">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, well, yeah. . . I mean, I don't know. You know, for example, one scheme that I know worked quite well was a scheme where a lot of young people were engaged in meeting and greeting newly arrived visitors to Sydney, and part of the work they were given . . . or part of the package they were given and might be given under this arrangement . . . would be a short training course at a TAFE college as part and parcel of the package that they would be offered.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The answer suggests how half&hyphen;baked and shot from the hip this policy was, but there was some sort of undertaking in this answer that there would be a training component in this program, and there is absolutely no sign of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The labour market programs of the former government did deliver certain outcomes, although they were too short&mdash;26 weeks on LEAP. I met many young and middle aged people who had worked on that program and who had just become enthused at their contribution to what they saw as a very worthwhile program when the program came to a shuddering halt. They were forced to return for 18 months to the dole queues before they could qualify again for that program. There were features of both skillshare and LEAP in particular that I thought were very beneficial.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I always believed they should have been far longer programs so that their participants were given some sense of belonging to something on a long&hyphen;term basis. They then became employed not by the government on some work program, but they became enmeshed in the work force and became part of the work force, because that work force is largely becoming a part&hyphen;time work force these days. If they had had two days a week of belonging to a program over three years with a training component, it would have made far more sense than the short, sharp 26&hyphen;week program which largely hid them from the numbers on the unemployment figures and did not much more in many cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would be suggesting that we look at the farm sector in this program. I believe that there are many farmers out there who would love to have a person come and work for them one or two days a week. I have been criticised in my area for suggesting that by the state Labor member for the seat of Bathurst, who says that this would mean putting
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cheap labour in to take work away from other people. The jobs just are not there on the farms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was driving down the road south of Bathurst the other day towards the little village of Burraga and a farmer was standing in his yards mustering about a thousand sheep all on his own. I commented to the person with me how lonely a task farming is these days. The family farm is essentially made up of the farmer and his lady and the lady most often has to go off the farm to earn some other money to supplement the income. Having someone to help them get the essential jobs done would be useful. There is a critical situation with weed control in my electorate. They just cannot keep up with it. They have not got the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we could see our way clear to having a two&hyphen;day a week work component with training, you could employ 30,000, 40,000 or 50,000 people and they would be volunteering. There should be no sense of compulsion with 10,000 jobs being provided under this scheme initially. They would be lining up for them. It is not a sense of compulsion we should be talking about. We are talking about real people who want to work in most cases and want to be part of this community, not isolated, marginalised and made to feel like they are lepers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another useful program would be classifying and recording archival film at the regional television stations, one of which I worked for for many years. There is a heap of material of historical value sitting in cans on shelves and in unairconditioned circumstances where they will break down and deteriorate to the point where they will be useless. They need to be transferred urgently to the new digital recording technology. This will be a wonderful archival contribution and something that we could perhaps look at as one of our federation projects. We could train people in this state-of-the&hyphen;art technology to do this work. Much the same program was used in America during the depression to record the final words of the surviving slaves and those people who had worked in the pioneering part of America, especially in the southern states. They would be recording archival material,
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3776"> something of value&mdash;not the bench painting exercise that some people have been alluding to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is floundering and looking for some creative ideas to employ these young and older people in this scheme. We could use those people who have been downsized to act as the managers of this program so we do not create another bureaucracy or impose on local government to come up with the means of putting this project into play. Let's get creative. Let's not just call it work for the dole. Let's not point the finger at those people and say they are sitting back watching television all day. That would be five per cent of them at most of the 30 per cent of the young unemployed who are out there in the towns, regional centres and are really becoming quite cynical&mdash;and I can understand it&mdash;of the ability of this nation to ever deliver them any share of the economy or the fruits of the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have four per cent growth in this country&mdash;the first time we have had growth of those proportions without jobs. It is non-jobs growth. We are not generating new jobs and yet we have what is boasted by the economists, the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and everyone else who is well off to be a good healthy economy. It is not. There are no jobs being generated and there are many thousands out there who wonder when, if ever, they will be able to share in the fruits that we hope this country can generate. I would ask too that a voluntary rather than compulsory factor be built into this work for the dole scheme.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course, the budget which the government put in place this week was a pro national savings budget. One of the proudest achievements of this first Howard government will be that we took a $10.3 billion Labor deficit and we turned it into a $1.6 billion coalition surplus. A turnaround of that dimension&mdash;of around $11 billion or $12 billion over the course of the first parliamentary term&mdash;is a turnaround of about two per cent of GDP. This is a government that has put in place a program for national savings and led the way. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We must say that with a great deal of mirth we saw the Labor Party out talking about national savings and various schemes for national savings that they would like to think that they would have introduced, if they had only been able to stay in office for more than 13 years. But nothing could have been less pro national savings than their fiscal policy. Their fiscal policy would
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have been running down national savings all the way into the next century and beyond. And this is a government which was able to turn that around&mdash;a 2 percentage point change in GDP over the first term of the government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the budget on Tuesday night, we went a step further because not only are we now able to say that this government has turned from borrowing to saving, we are now able to say that this government has turned the tax system so that it now has a direct incentive for saving as well. And those measures which we put in place on Tuesday night to put to bed the tawdry episode of deceit over the l&hyphen;a&hyphen;w tax cuts were measures open to all and open to all kinds of saving.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I notice that the Labor Party is now out claiming that they are somehow concerned that the $450 tax rebate will be open to all income earners and that income earners like the Prime Minister will be able to get it as well as other income earners. Let me make this clear: this pro&hyphen;savings savings rebate which replaces the l&hyphen;a&hyphen;w tax cuts is targeted at low income earners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A Keating Labor minister who voted for the l&hyphen;a&hyphen;w tax cuts in 1992 would have received, under those l&hyphen;a&hyphen;w tax cuts, a tax deduction of $1,252 a year. A person on $20,000, under the l&hyphen;a&hyphen;w tax cuts, would have received a tax cut of zero. The Keating Labor ministers in 1992&mdash;those people now concerned about progressive tax systems&mdash;voted for themselves, with the l&hyphen;a&hyphen;w cuts, a tax cut of $1,252 per annum&mdash;and for the battlers of Australia, nothing, not one dollar. Now we find that they are all getting concerned, after the election, about progressivity in the tax system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me compare it with the measures that we introduced for the savings rebate. After you have claimed that 15 per cent rebate on your marginal tax rate, a person on $20,000 a year would pay $150 on $3,000 worth of savings; a person on $40,000 a year would pay $840 after claiming the rebate; and a person on $70,000 a year would pay $960 after claiming the rebate for savings&mdash;totally progressive. The biggest benefits are to the low income earners, and there are benefits of lesser dimension to the higher income earners as well. That is a 15 per cent rebate off a

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In answer to the member for Fairfax, who represents a very large number of self&hyphen;funded retirees in his electorate, let me say one or two things about the relevance of this savings proposal so far as self&hyphen;funded retirees are concerned. The first point I want to make is that, like people who were earning under $20,000, the Labor Party's now discredited superannuation l&hyphen;a&hyphen;w, law scheme provided absolutely no benefits at all for self&hyphen;funded retirees. The scheme that we have abandoned was savagely penal so far as self&hyphen;funded retirees were concerned. For those opposite who interject, might I remind them of something that was said by the now Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate on 10 May 1995. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we are . . . not spending the second tranche of the tax cuts in that way but rather diverting that government payout in other directions . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In other words, they decided to divert the money away from retired Australians. Retired Australians have worked their lives contributing money and when that money was collected by the federal Treasury, what did the Australian Labor Party decide to do? They decided to spit in the faces of those retired Australians, they decided to say to those retired Australians, `We won't give you any access to the l-a-w law tax cuts.' He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Obviously it would be desirable, from the point of view of self&hyphen;funded retirees, to be able to deliver them tax cuts. But there are lots of things that are desirable that are simply not attainable and not achievable. There are more immediate priorities . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Let me repeat that, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are more immediate priorities . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The now shadow Treasurer was saying in 1995 that there were more immediate priorities in the eyes of the Labor Party than delivering tax justice to self-funded retirees in this country. So can I say to the member for Fairfax that one of the most important elements of our plan is that self-funded retirees will get a fair share in relation to the taxation rebate, unlike under Labor, which offered nothing in this area to self-funded retirees. All self-funded retirees will be able to contribute.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many retired Australians who warmly welcome this initiative by the government. There are many retired Australians who have modest savings.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They belong to a generation that worked hard and sacrificed a lot. They paid their taxes. They were told by Labor they were going to be left out in the cold. Let me say to the self&hyphen;funded retirees, `Our savings scheme will bring you in from the cold. Our savings scheme will be open to you. Our savings scheme will reward your thrift.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for her question. There is a great deal of nonsense being talked about in the changes to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The facts are that, with the therapeutic group price premiums, the additional costs for people are totally avoidable. Let me repeat that: patients, if they do not wish to pay a premium, can choose to change to another brand that is no more expensive than what they are paying at the moment. It very simply maintains people's right to freedom of choice while properly limiting taxpayers' liability. It will also introduce substantial price competition into the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, something that does not exist in most areas at the moment because the government subsidises the cost of drugs to 100 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similar policies are in place in several other countries, such as New Zealand, Germany and the Netherlands. These products are grouped together because they are chemically very similar and they have very similar clinical effects.

There has been a very positive reaction to this proposal to exempt those small businesses with 15 employees or fewer from the unfair dismissal scheme in the first 12 months of somebody's employment. The initial reaction came from Senator Cook, from the Labor opposition, who said it was not a bad idea. We had the Labor shadow spokesman for small business saying the other say basically it would be political suicide for the Labor Party to oppose it. In the last 24 hours we have had a whole series of people saying it is a good idea. A spokesperson for the small business community said that Labor's decision was:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is undoubtedly true, as suggested by the honourable member for McMillan, that one of the principal features of the second budget delivered by the Treasurer earlier this week is that it dealt with some of the worst legacies of the former Labor administration. No amount of noise at question time, no amount of guffawing by those who sit opposite, no amount of obfuscation at question time or in the press can alter a number of single unassailable facts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first and most important of those is that in March of 1996 the newly elected coalition government inherited an underlying budget deficit of $10,500 million. By the third year of our first term in office we will have turned that into a surplus of $1,600 million. It is a scale of fiscal turnaround that has not been achieved by any federal government since Federation and it far exceeds the fiscal turnaround achieved by state governments in Australia over the last few years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a magnificent tribute to the particular skill and application and work of my colleagues the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance.

It said on the paper that was in this chamber this morning, `Not available prior to tabling.' As that legislation is in the middle of debate in this House at the moment, I wondered whether the supplementary explanatory memorandum would therefore have any bearing on the debate that has proceeded in this House

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I would like to report to the House on my recent visits to Singapore and China between 26 March and 2 April. Both visits were part of a deliberate pattern of visits I have made as Prime Minister to key regional countries in the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region. They follow my visits during 1996 to Indonesia and Japan, and my participation in the APEC leaders meeting in Manila.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The message I conveyed during my visit was that my government was committed&mdash;and very strongly so&mdash;to building Australia's
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3794"> engagement in the region. There can be no doubt that Australia's political and economic future is closely bound up with the future of the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region. Our success in our economic partnership with our region will be vital to our economic prospects and to our capacity to generate worthwhile jobs in Australia, especially for our children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My government is committed to ensuring that Australia's economy is equipped to compete for a share of the spectacular growth in the region, that adequate frameworks are in place at a government level with our regional partners to facilitate business and other links and that Australia plays an active part as a member of the regional community in shaping its future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to extend my deep appreciation to my hosts in both Singapore and China for the warmth and generosity of the hospitality they extended to me and to my party. This was a compliment to Australia, a measure of the regard with which Australia is held in both countries and a recognition of the great benefits which flow to both sides from our relationships.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Singapore, in meetings with President Ong, the Prime Minister, Goh Chok Tong, and the Senior Minister, Lee Kuan Yew, I reaffirmed my commitment to Australia's partnership with Singapore. In an address to a major business lunch hosted jointly by the Singapore Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry and the Singapore Australia Business Council, I outlined the strengths that Australia brings to its economic engagement with the region and the benefits of my government's reform program in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia's relationship with Singapore is one of the most diverse and active we have in the region. I marked an important element in the history of that relationship in laying a wreath at the Kranji Commonwealth War Cemetery where 1,100 Australians are buried and the deaths of 1,640 others are commemorated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Singapore is our largest trade and investment partner in ASEAN, with total bilateral trade worth $5.8 billion last year. It is one of the principal sources of visitors to Australia,
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and the second largest foreign investor in Australia's tourist industry. About 11,000 young Singaporeans studied in Australia last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We cooperate very closely with Singapore regionally and internationally. We have very similar views on the importance of APEC. The government is working closely with Singapore to consolidate APEC's role as the pre&hyphen;eminent structure for regional cooperation and to ensure that the momentum of trade and investment liberalisation is maintained within APEC. Singapore's own economic success is a testament to the benefits of liberalisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I expressed my appreciation to the Prime Minister for Singapore's strong and consistent support for Australia's membership of the Asia&hyphen;Europe Meeting, noting the appropriateness of Australia's participation in this body. We have strong defence links with Singapore and Malaysia through the five power defence arrangements. The Singapore government expressed to me its appreciation for the training facilities that Australia provides for Singapore's armed forces.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given the breadth and depth of our links it was particularly pleasing to be able to announce with the Singapore Prime Minister a new aviation agreement which provides for nearly a 40 per cent increase in services between Australia and Singapore, meaning about 30 extra Boeing 747 services between the two countries every week. The agreement will also result in a doubling of the number of air freight services between Australia and Singapore.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I may depart from my written text and interpolate, one of the events that I remember most from my visit to Singapore was a gathering at the Australian High Commission of some of the hundreds of the alumni of Singaporeans who had been to Australian universities over a very long period of time. As a reminder not only of the past but of the continuing close relationships between our two countries, one graduate of Sydney University from the early 1960s approached me and pointed out that his daughter and my daughter are currently classmates at Sydney University and that they had participated
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3795"> together in the Sydney University law review last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was a personal reminder to me of the depths of the links between us and the way in which those links span different generations of Australians. It is also a very proud reminder to any Australian politician of the massive contribution that the Colombo Plan and those educational links between Australia and Malaysia and Singapore in particular have made to the very strong bilateral relationships we have. It drives home to all of us that the association between Australia and the nations of the region is not a recent thing: it is something that is very deeply rooted in the post&hyphen;World War II experience of Australia and something to which great contributions have been made by leaders of both sides of the Australian political divide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My visit to China had, as a principal objective, establishing a good working relationship with the Chinese leadership and suggesting new horizons for our economic partnership. I underlined the continuity of Australia's commitment to a strong relationship with China, acknowledging the contributions made by previous governments from both sides of politics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Reflecting the strength of the bilateral economic relationship and the priority Australia attaches to it, some of Australia's most senior business leaders participated in my delegation. I would like to particularly thank those business leaders who accompanied me for their contribution to the visit's success. Their participation sent a very positive signal to the Chinese government about the commitment of the government and the business community to work together in strengthening the relationship with China.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Might I again interpolate another recollection of a personal kind in connection with the business delegation. One of the members of that business delegation is a businessman well known to many members of the House, Mr Lewis Ting, who is the managing partner of Ernst and Young. When we had a meeting with the Vice Premier, Mr Zhu Rongji, who will visit Australia very shortly, Mr Ting was amongst the four members of the business delegation who was invited to make a presen
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tation to the Vice Premier and, as he opened his presentation, he pointed out that one of his grandparents had been born in Shanghai and that he could trace his ancestry back to one of the provinces of China in the 11th century. And then he rather dissolved the gathering into some laughter&mdash;particularly on the Chinese side&mdash;when he expressed his regrets that he was not nearly as fluent as the minister in Mandarin. It was another very good reminder of the personal links between Australia and the nations of the region, which are so very important to building sound relationships at a national level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given our mutual interests&mdash;and the importance to the region of cooperation between us&mdash;good communication between Australia and China is crucial. I proposed&mdash;and the Premier Mr Li Peng agreed&mdash;that we should strengthen dialogue at a political level. We agreed that we would meet regularly at head of government level. I also proposed that the ministerial framework for discussion of economic cooperation be upgraded and broadened, in order to ensure our economic complementarities achieved their full potential. In short, my government is seeking a partnership in growth with China. I am pleased that we will have the opportunity to continue our discussions on this when the Vice Premier, Zhu Rongji, visits later this month.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">China is already our fifth&hyphen;largest trading partner. In the past decade, Australia's trade with China has grown twice as fast as our trade with the rest of the world. By the year 2000, China could be our third largest trading partner, after Japan and the United States. Australia will maintain its track record as a reliable supplier of mineral and agricultural commodities. China is already our largest wool market&mdash;taking about one quarter of our wool exports&mdash;and we supply about 60 per cent of its iron ore imports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I drew the Chinese leadership's attention, however, to the much greater role that Australia could play in fuelling China's economic growth. President Jiang Zemin responded well to this. Australia can play the part in China's economic growth that we played during the rapid industrialisation of Japan and Korea. Possible areas for expansion include LNG and
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3796"> directly reduced iron, DRI. During my visit China agreed to send a feasibility study team to Australia to look further at the prospects for directly reduced iron.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Investment from China could play an important role in consolidating this economic partnership. I reaffirmed that Chinese investment would be most welcome. According to Chinese figures, we are already the second largest destination for Chinese investment, after Hong Kong. Australian investment in China is also growing at a rapid rate. The composition of the business group that travelled with me reflected the scope for this partnership to expand into new areas, including manufactures, construction and services. In particular, my visit highlighted Australia's strength in financial services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During my visit, I participated in a ceremony to mark the issuing to the ANZ Bank of a licence to operate a branch in Beijing. I opened a seminar sponsored by the Australian Stock Exchange in order to explain the benefits for Chinese companies of listing in Australia. Just before I visited, AMP received a licence to open a representative office in Beijing. I supported the applications Colonial Mutual and National Mutual have made for licences to operate in China. I also opened Ansett's new office in Shanghai.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Closer political cooperation between Australia and China is also important. There will, of course, be differences from time to time between us, reflecting our different traditions, cultures and political systems. My government's approach to China will be based on the principles of mutual respect and recognition of our mutual interests. It is better that any differences are discussed openly and directly in a non&hyphen;confrontational way&mdash;in the context of a mutual recognition of the value of our cooperation to each other and the importance of it to the region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I reiterated in my discussions that Australia did not regard China as a threat. China's economic growth was to be welcomed, not feared. Rather, we wanted to see China constructively involved in regional institutions and beyond. I underlined our shared interests in APEC. I promoted publicly the benefits for  China itself and for the rest of us of early
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Chinese accession to the World Trade Organisation on reasonable terms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dialogue with China on regional security issues is important. President Jiang Zemin's ready response to my suggestion that our respective defence forces should have regular talks was, therefore, very pleasing. These talks should help provide a clearer understanding of our respective outlooks and promote stability in our region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I reaffirmed the government's commitment to the one&hyphen;China policy. Australia will pursue its legitimate economic interests in Taiwan with due regard to the sensitivities involved. China has agreed to regular consular talks and my government has agreed to discuss a possible consular agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I raised the case of Mr James Peng, and Li Peng, the Chinese Premier, undertook to pass on my concerns to the relevant authorities. The Premier assured me that China would respect all the freedoms of Hong Kong after 30 June as laid down in the Basic Law agreed by the UK and Chinese governments. Since my visit, China has agreed to my proposal for a human rights dialogue. We see such a dialogue as a constructive and potentially productive way of engaging China on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I want to say something about the importance of the human ties that bind us with the countries of the region. I have already spoken of my visit to the High Commission in Singapore and the meeting with the alumni of Australian educational institutions. In Beijing I held a reception for Australian students in China and Chinese students of Australian studies. These were significant and very enjoyable parts of my program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The store of knowledge of Australia that these links constitute is hugely beneficial to Australia. The understanding of Australia that they generate&mdash;its qualities and values, its economic, intellectual and physical attributes&mdash;is quite invaluable. Likewise, the communities within Australia who trace their origins to Singapore and China play a significant role in our relationships with these countries. These communities have made an invaluable contribution to Australia. Their success in our country and the esteem in
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3797"> which we hold them are important measures of the sort of society we are and the sort of relationship we want with our neighbours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Might I also take the opportunity of recording my respect for the high quality of the Australian missions in the two countries that I visited. At every stage of my visit I received unqualified support and very high quality professional advice. In the very important discussions that I had with the Chinese leadership, I was very grateful to have an ambassador of the quality of Mr Ric Smith, who is the Australian ambassador in the People's Republic of China. It is a reminder that there remains within the Australian Public Service a very strong streak of high quality professionalism. The quality of the representation that the men and women of that calibre give to this country overseas is something of which I think all members of this House should remain conscious, and it is something that does this country very proud indeed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The parliament rarely has an opportunity to discuss foreign policy matters or defence matters. We virtually only get the opportunity if we choose to raise these issues in private members' time or when we briefly debate ministerial statements from the Minister for Foreign Affairs and statements on visits by the Prime Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately&mdash;and I do not particularly blame this government for this particular operation; it has become longstanding over the last 20 years in parliament&mdash;in providing for the foreign affairs and the defence of the nation&mdash;one of the reasons this federal polity of ours was created&mdash;we rarely get an opportunity for serious discussion in the principal forum of the development of national policy.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Therefore, we have to operate on a thin grill, and that thin grill comes most often, as I said, with statements on ministerial visits by the Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rather anodyne and unexceptional statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) conceals&mdash;I am not saying deliberately; nevertheless it conceals&mdash;something of a hiatus, if not to say crisis, in relationships between Australians and the nations and the region around us. In the case of China, a very poor relationship has developed over the course of the last six months or so. In fact, it could be said that this particular visit of the Prime Minister, which has been on the agenda for some considerable time, had a question mark over it as to whether or not it would take place at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I strongly suspect that it was a decision taken by the Chinese leadership to set aside exception they had taken to some of the attitudes and actions of this government in order to clear the decks for the principal focus of their attention in international politics&mdash;the absorption over the next few months of the shortly to be former British colony of Hong Kong. Right around the globe over the course of the last few months the Chinese have been clearing the decks in their relationship with a number of countries where there have been points of disagreements in the recent past as they seek to focus on that matter alone. That is not to say that necessarily any of the problems that have been associated with those concerns have been set aside.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The situation that confronted the Prime Minister is a very different situation from that which he confronted when he got into office. Had there been no events from the day of his election to the day of his visit to these two countries, he would have arrived in these two countries with no question marks over Australia's policy. He would have arrived in these two countries with a background, in respect of our relationship with China, of a massively burgeoning increase in the trade arrangements and a frequent set of ministerial contacts at foreign ministerial level, at prime ministerial level and at trade ministerial
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3798"> level&mdash;at any level, in fact, you would care to name.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You would have found accompanying those visits between the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) or the Prime Minister and their equivalents in China frequent robust discussions on matters of human rights, on matters related to the situation in Tibet, on matters related to security arrangements in the region, on matters related to Australia's relationship with the United States and on matters related to Australia's attitudes to the Western alliance. Those discussions would have been held with no problems attached to them whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that there was mutual agreement that there are matters that we would disagree on from time to time did not mean that the matters which we disagree on had to be set to one side or have a special process created for them. What you got was a situation where you could raise them, as most countries do, in a normal bilateral relationship between two countries and no special problem or special arrangement needed to be made for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is part and parcel of conducting your diplomacy on the basis of a free and independent nation with your own views on your strategic circumstances, your own views on your strategic needs, your own views on human rights or whatever, not one that is marshalled and incorporated within the lowest common denominator of what is capable of being sustained by both sides.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was not the situation that the Prime Minister walked into; the Prime Minister walked into a totally different situation. It was a totally different situation largely of a making of his own government, starting with a reneging on those DIFF contracts with China, followed by the belittling of the Chinese ministers who complained about what had happened with those DIFF arrangements, telling the Chinese then out of our largess that they might be able to secure one or two of these projects provided they renegotiated our aid arrangements with them, followed by speculating about uranium sales to Taiwan and then undisciplined babbling by the defence minister&mdash;when the foreign minister was trying to fix up some of the problems
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> associated with this&mdash;about the nature of the Chinese threat and how the American alliance might be used to counter it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was followed by a set of unexceptional arrangements being put in place with the Americans, arrangements that continued a deep and abiding relationship that we had in place and that we enjoyed with the United States, claiming new things that were in fact old or initiatives that had been started under the previous government as something new. That allowed an impression to be created out there in the general public and, more particularly, in the region around us that a new strategic partnership had started with the United States.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We on this side of the House value our relationship with the United States. We value it personally. We value it as part of our nation's security. But we never felt the need to clothe the claim for it and rub people's noses in it because there was a more sophisticated attitude to the way in which you conducted a security dialogue with a region and with nations in the region who may have had some degree of sensitivity about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From that followed a plethora of commentary from Chinese officials, including very senior Chinese officials, warning Australia that they would not tolerate for one minute a new pincer movement, as was being suggested by one of them, between the United States and Australia in relation to China and they would not tolerate for one minute in any sense from the Australian side that they were being contained. What you see in that process is this: a situation in which by overclaiming, by bumbling, by incompetence, by insult, the Australian government placing itself in a position where it could not discuss in strategic terms the principal partnership that we have with China.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What an extraordinary thing to visit one of the major powers in the Pacific, probably the major power in the Pacific in the next 30 or 40 years, and have a curtain drawn over our relationship with the United States in any discussions with them because it was too embarrassing for us to mention and because of a bit of pressure there it was pushed quietly off the agenda.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3799">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What sort of relationship do we have with the countries in the region? It reduced the Prime Minister's visit to a well&hyphen;focused, state Premier's visit. I am not going to belittle the fact that there were achievements there on the economic front. If you see a Premier go to China or any other country in the region now, you will see them accompanied by a bevy of business people. You will see them arriving at trading agreements, trading arrangements. You will see the business interests of Australia advance. How else over the last 13 years did the trade between China and Australia increase exponentially in a nation which values very much government to government contact backing up the activity of the private sector?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many state premiers who have done very well in that regard as they have presented themselves in China. As something the equivalent of that, so did the Prime Minister. He presented himself effectively in Beijing as a state Premier with Australia's considerable wares to lay on the Chinese table. But that is the job of a Premier. That is not the job of a Prime Minister. The job of a Prime Minister is to engage the major powers in this region across the board, across the board of all our strategic and security concerns, across the board of all the issues that we regard as morally important in the region, be they on human rights or anything else. It does not mean you march in and rub people's noses in it; it means that you raise it forthrightly in the sessions which you have. When you have those concerns, you raise them effectively.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Above all, with China, we have to be able to discuss what we hold as important in security terms and why we have those concerns, why we have those views and why we have those relationships. We have to obviously do it in a sophisticated and effective manner, and to allow an impression to be engaged that we were somehow or other trying to put China into a position where we and the Americans were going to contain it was not the best introduction, I do have to say, to what ought to have been the sort of dialogue that we ought to have had. But, somehow or other, with the powerful relation ship we had
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> with the United States for 13 years, we managed it. We managed to hold discussions with the Chinese on major security issues; the Prime Minister did not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister went there and obtained an agreement to consult on human rights issues and he touts that as favourable. I am afraid to say I cannot see it that way. I do not think every time you visit China you are going to be required to raise human rights issues. You raise them when you need to. If you do not need to, you do not bother. The notion that you need to have an automatic consultation of this incorporates you in a dialogue and restricts the capacity of other people to make those points, and that has been noted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can you imagine what would happen if an Australian Prime Minister of the Labor Party came back from China and the leading communist party newspaper in China produced a set of comments like this&mdash;`Wise choice' the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">People's Daily</EMPHASIS> said of Australia as we walked away from the United Nations resolution on human rights in Geneva. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> reported the activities by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">"They are not willing to bind with the US," the Communist Party paper said. "They are not willing to continuously act as a human rights judge and not willing to set up a pointless confrontation with developing countries.</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">"The result shows that confrontation on human rights is also becoming unpopular in the Western world."</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The response of the people in the United States to that Communist Party newspaper set of commentaries would be one of mild humiliation. If the Liberal Party had been in opposition and we had been in government, we would have been pasted all over the walls of this chamber for that particular set of commentaries. How the wheel has turned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the wheel has turned for only one reason. When this government came back into office, it took a giant backward step. It handled its international affairs with complete incompetence&mdash;not just mild incompetence but complete incompetence&mdash;and the consequence of that is now worn by our principal
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3800"> ally. The humiliation is worn by our principal ally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that we have got ourselves into a situation which penalises not so much us any more. We have been incorporated into a dialogue acceptable to China&mdash;a most important country&mdash;and taken out of a framework in which we, with our Chinese colleagues, can discuss what is most serious on our hearts about the security of the region. We are going to pay a price for that. That price is going to be a long time coming, but we will pay it. We will pay a price for that particular set of propositions. And, as I said, it was a completely unnecessary set of conclusions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do have things to say to the Chinese about security matters. I think the ASEAN initiative in the ASEAN Regional Forum actually does operate in the best way, without going down the stale road of containment of setting up, in the informal sort of way the countries in the region like, for security dialogue, confidence building and functional integration. There is a lot to be done on that. Did the Prime Minister present any views on that to his Chinese interlocutors when he was in China? I doubt it. It is certainly not incorporated within the framework of his statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But there is a lot of water flowing under the bridge in that particular area at the moment&mdash;a lot of water. Good work is being done, and the Chinese are involved. Attitudes are being expressed by countries in the region as to what contribution could be made. We are part of that forum, but what is our view?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is our view on the security arrangements for this region? What view could have been presented to the Chinese interlocutors if we had not been frightened off the ground, frightened off the territory? Any government with the defence interests of its nation at hand would have presented that view, but we were frightened off from having a dialogue with one of the principal powers in the region, a power which will probably be the principal power in the region over the next 50 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we had a great premier's visit and a non-entity of a Prime Minister's visit in the course of that. It was a framework made available not by the Australian government on
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the importance and significance of the views of the Australian government, but by a sensible, tactical decision by the Chinese that they clear the decks in the intervening period from a few months ago to the point of time when Hong Kong comes back within China. It was not much of an achievement by the Prime Minister, and the problem is that I do not think the Prime Minister has the first idea of what these problems and concerns are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister went to Singapore and the Prime Minister made some very good comments both about our relationship with Singapore and about the building of those relationships with the students. We thank him for the comments he made, but the five&hyphen;power defence arrangement and all those agreements in defence terms with Singapore were made by Senator Ray, by and large, and then briefly by myself when I happened to be in office.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise this afternoon to speak on an issue of major public importance and it goes to the question of what I would describe as a fairly important road show&mdash;the Mr Wishy-Washy and Mr Smug Road Show. I want to deal with the performance of that road show over the last 12 months and, more importantly, in the last couple of weeks. Because I tell you what: this road show in the last couple of weeks has gone out of its way to create certain expectations in the Australian community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the most important issues that the Australian community is looking for some leadership on at the moment&mdash;and the road show has even touched upon this issue in the last couple of weeks, especially in the media in regional Australia&mdash;is that all important question of jobs, the sense of job security. I suggest that an emerging major problem confronting Australia at the moment is not just the issue of youth unemployment but, importantly, the issue of rising unemployment amongst blue-collar middle&hyphen;aged males.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem with the road show goes to the failure, I suggest, of the government to address in its budget the need to find jobs for 802,300 unemployed Australians, including 264,400 long&hyphen;term unemployed Australians and, unfortunately, 90,000 young unemployed, who, even this week, have to confront cuts in expenditure on education and training, contrary to what the Minister for Schools, Voca
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tional Education and Training (Dr Kemp) would have the House believe today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1997 budget has failed to deliver. It has failed to deliver miserably to the Australian community on the issue of jobs and job security. It has failed to deliver to the battlers and their families. It has failed to deliver to the mob that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) likes to refer to from time to time. I suggest in passing that failure to deliver represents a continuation of trend with respect to the performance of this government since they were elected 12 months ago. They have failed to deliver to the Australian community on a range of matters. The real issue that the Australian community is looking for with respect to leadership at the moment is the issue of jobs&mdash;the question of some hope and security for the future of the Australian community. That is the No. 1 agenda item out there in mainstream Australia at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did the wishy&hyphen;washy and smug road show say to the Australian community today? It was not a big tick about doing something to create jobs and a sense of security in people's lives. It was a big snub to the battlers. That is what it was: a huge snub to the Australian community about the issue of jobs and a sense of security and hope in life. I will tell you why it is worse&mdash;because, in the last couple of weeks, they finally got some feedback from the Director of the Liberal Party, Mr Robb, who has recently vacated the chair. One of his parting gestures was a message to the Prime Minister along these lines, `Look, Mr Prime Minister, your minister for employment, Senator Vanstone, is right'&mdash;you know, the senior minister of the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training&mdash;`when she basically suggested that, if we do not deliver on the jobs front'&mdash;and she has said it on a couple of occasions, much to the upset of the Prime Minister&mdash;`then you really do not have a right to be re&hyphen;elected at the next federal election.'</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LS4">Mr MARTIN FERGUSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, as the member for Dobell said, she was even reprimanded by the party organisational structure and by a range of members on the frontbench. I suppose when it comes to a question of
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3802"> leadership, we should not be surprised that the Prime Minister has failed to deliver on the question of jobs and job security. As I have said, it represents a trend in government of the Howard government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You look around at the big issues&mdash;and budget night is about the big road show. The Australian community sits there and listens to the television and the radio. It is looking for direction. It is looking for the hard decisions. It is looking for a Prime Minister and a Treasurer to actually stand up with some commitment and say, `We've got the answers and we are going to give it our best to do something and to deliver to you.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But you know, it is not just jobs and job security. Where has the government been, for example, on the issue of the Hanson debate? Where has the Prime Minister been? He has gone missing in action. Where has he been on the race debate? I will tell you where the Prime Minister has been. He has gone missing in action. Where has he been on the all&hyphen;important question of industry policy? Again, missing in action. Where has he been on the issue of regional Australia&mdash;the question of Cairns, Ballarat, Bendigo, all those important regions which are experiencing great difficulties with respect to unemployment and social dislocation at the moment? Where was he on industry policy in regional Australia? Gone missing in action. Even on the question of women and their capacity to take their rightful place in the Australian work force and the issue of access to child care, where was the Prime Minister? Unfortunately, missing in action again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He might like to go over to China and sell out on the question of human rights and come back to Australia and suggest that that is a big achievement but, I tell you what, the Australian community at the moment is concerned about bread and butter issues, the issues of jobs and job security. I suppose leadership does require a bit of stature, a willingness to make hard decisions&mdash;not intellectual pygmies who go missing in action when the hard decisions come around, but people who are prepared to lay out a plan and basically, in essence, put their heads down and tails up and get on with the job of doing
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> something to create that environment that encourages investment and confidence, which in turn leads to jobs and real job creation in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose budget night is about lots of lights, dazzle, big numbers and big speeches. We even had the Treasurer (Mr Costello) dancing around&mdash;a bit like some have suggested before, the loaded dog, at the dispatch box last Tuesday night&mdash;tongue hanging out one corner of the mouth, the make&hyphen;up on and the stick of dynamite hanging out of the other side of the mouth. He was prancing around because, unfortunately, the Speaker was a little bit late and he wanted to spit out this great picture about where Australia is going on the issues of jobs and job security. All of a sudden he rises to his feet: `Here I am to tell Australia about how fortunate they are. Firstly, they have got me'&mdash;the loaded dog&mdash;`as the Treasurer of Australia. But I am going to tell you about your future this evening.' So he starts off at page 2: `These are the key issues, helping families'&mdash;well, I think jobs and job security are important to families&mdash;`boosting small business, creating jobs'&mdash;the third point on page 2&mdash;`and encouraging saving.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We sat here. We have looked at all the regional press and the stories&mdash;all the expectations that have been created in the last couple of weeks. I recall that that was the same day that the Australian Bureau of Statistics released the long&hyphen;term unemployment figures and the figures relating to unemployment in regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just over a month ago I did have cause to look at these regional unemployment figures. In question time some months ago the Prime Minister said to me that after 12 months of a coalition government I would have the right to ask him a question about unemployment. So I waited for that 12 months to lapse&mdash;I am a very patient man&mdash;and what did those figures say about regional unemployment? They said 77 per cent of regional Australia is worse off on the unemployment front as a result of the first year, one-third of the normal life of a parliament if it runs its full term, of the Howard government.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3803">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since those figures came out the message has been spelled out by Mr Wishy-Washy and Mr Smug Road Show all around Australia, backed up by Dr Do&hyphen;Little, the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. He does very little for jobs, very little for universities, very little for equality of access to education. I think he is concerned with only one issue at the moment: Dr Do&hyphen;Little feels he should be sitting at the cabinet table rather than his senior minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today the Prime Minister wanted to talk about the reaction of some of the business community. I listened to his long list of friends, but there are other commentators&mdash;such as Katie Lahey, who is only the Chief Executive Officer of the New South Wales Chamber of Commerce. It is appropriate we quote what she said about the budget because it is fairly relevant to the issue of unemployment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">There were no real initiatives (in the budget) to help business soak up the unemployed, which is a concern.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I agree with her. She even did a survey of members of the New South Wales chamber. And what did that survey say? It said&mdash;and this is factual&mdash;that 76 per cent of members surveyed by the New South Wales chamber believe that the budget would not create jobs. That is what the business community believes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then I go to Access Economics&mdash;friends of the coalition, as you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, and frequent advisers who do detailed work in the preparation of coalition policies. What did they say today? It is reported in the media that they have suggested&mdash;and I believe this is also the view of the Research Bank Governor and the Secretary to the Treasury, as spelt out last week; unfortunately, the minister for employment did not know the difference between the two when questioned last week&mdash;that economic growth of 3.75 per cent would lead to an unemployment rate above 8.25 per cent. That is what Mr Richardson of Access Economics said this morning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Anyhow, the road show has gone on, and unfortunately the reviews have not been too good. The critics have been looking at the budget, including the Treasurer of Queens
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> land, Mrs Sheldon, and the Liberal Party leader, who have also canned the budget on the unemployment front.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem is that, when the reviews start to go bad&mdash;and we understand some of the critics get a little bit bitchy at times&mdash;the main players, Mr Wishy-Washy and Mr Smug, go around backdooring one another. That is what is happening in the gallery at the moment. Mr Smug is up there saying, `Look, if I had had my way it would have been a better road show. But, unfortunately, Mr Wishy-Washy was interfering. It is also his budget. If I had had my way, we probably would not have even mentioned the issue of unemployment in the budget because that is not a real priority.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So at the end of the show we are going to have to live with the bitchiness between the road show main players, Mr Wishy-Washy and Mr Smug. It might be appropriate for them to play their little games, but it is about time we faced up to the fact that $21 million on the work for the dole scheme, with its 10,000 places and people working two days on and then having five days off, will not produce the goods. It is about time we faced up to the fact that the Federation Fund of $1 billion&mdash;with funding to commence not this year (I wonder why it will not commence this year) but in 1998-99, stretching out to 2001; and it will be interesting to see the pork&hyphen;barrelling that occurs under the Federation Fund&mdash;will not produce the goods either; nor will the government's savings policy, that great rip-off that is occurring with the frontbench of the government looking after itself, produce the goods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is about time we faced up to the fact that after 12 months this government has failed on the unemployment front. Unemployment is higher. Youth unemployment is higher. I understand why there is some sensitivity on the other side of the House: because it is now accepted in the Australian community that those so-called battlers that the Prime Minister was going to do so much for have been forgotten&mdash;forgotten on the savings front and forgotten on the unemployment front. What is the real problem confronting middle&hyphen;aged male battlers now? The real problem is that
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3804"> there is little hope for them or their families on the unemployment front as a result of this budget. There are 146,000 men between the ages of 35 and 45 who are looking for work and direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The time has come for this government to face up to the fact that it has got to stop and think about what it is not doing. What it is not doing at the moment is delivering on the issue of jobs, delivering on the issue of job security, delivering on the need to get our young people back to work and delivering on the need to get out there in middle Australia, amongst those middle&hyphen;aged men who want to look after their families, and ensure that we create a sense of hope and security for their future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the challenge for Dr Do&hyphen;Little and for Mr Wishy-Washy and Mr Smug Road Show. When it comes to performance, after all the expectations of the last couple of weeks the critics are going to be just as negative as they have been over the last couple of days.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If anyone were listening to the speech we have just heard from the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson), the ex-president of the ACTU, one of the architects of Australia's unemployment, they would be deeply disillusioned if they ever had any illusions about the Labor Party. What we have heard is pathetic empty rhetoric from the architects of the deeply entrenched unemployment that Australia now has.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) recently moved the member for Sydney (Mr Peter Baldwin) from his portfolio because he was not making any impact. I suppose any person hearing this debate would wonder how long it is going to be before the member for Batman is moved from his portfolio. They might remember, I suppose, that he is an ex-president of the ACTU. We know that ex-presidents of the ACTU are untouchable within the Labor Party because it is the ACTU who pays the bills and calls the tune. It is worth remembering, when we hear this
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> pathetic performance today, that this is nothing new from the member for Batman. When he was President of the ACTU, some 600,000 trade union members actually walked out of the trade union movement, which would have to be the most abysmal performance of the century by any ACTU president.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But of course the ACTU have absolutely no credibility on employment because they were the people pulling the strings throughout the whole period when the previous Labor government was creating the problem that this present government is fixing. For 13 years they implemented their policies. The result of those policies was a million unemployed, unemployment over 11 per cent, the worst unemployment since the Great Depression.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They had absolutely no answers whatsoever to the question of how you create jobs for Australians. In fact every policy they pursued&mdash;to pursue the narrow sectional interests of this trade union based party&mdash;made unemployment worse, because the trade unions in the end under the member for Batman were not interested in creating jobs; they were interested in trying to hold on to their rapidly diminishing membership, and their policies showed that. Over the last six years of the Labor government, as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said in question time today, the Labor Party succeeded in creating 16,000 additional new full-time jobs.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="SCOTT" NAMEID="YT4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YT4">Mr Bruce Scott</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;How many?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BT4">Dr KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Sixteen thousand additional new full-time jobs in the last six years of their government. A million people were unemployed and they created 16,000 full&hyphen;time jobs. That is their performance. And they seriously expect the Australian people to listen to this empty rhetoric and imagine that they have got any credibility whatsoever on the issue of unemployment. It took them 13 years to drive Australia down into the condition that it is in at the moment. That is not going to be fixed in 13 months, and every Australian knows that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us just have a look at why Labor failed so badly, because we certainly heard nothing today which would give anyone any impression that the Labor Party have a policy to deal with unemployment. They have no policy
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3805"> to create jobs. They have not got one now. Not one was articulated by the member for Batman and not one was put in place over their 13 years in government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the reasons for their failure. I suppose if you went to the core of their failure and asked why the unemployment situation is as bad as it is in this country, you would find that it is because for 13 years the Labor Party, manipulated by the ACTU, trampled right over small business. With the highest interest rates in the world, they drove tens of thousands of small businesses in Australia into bankruptcy. During their last major recession, they destroyed some 300,000 jobs in small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And then, just in case that was not enough, the member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton), sitting here at the table, the architect of the unfair dismissal law, went out and told small businesses that no matter how unsatisfactory any of their employees were the government was going to make it almost impossible for them to dismiss them and give a full-time job to somebody who could do the job. Sitting at the table today are the two great job destroyers in this country. We have had to take the necessary action to get rid of their laws, to get rid of their job destroying policies, and that is what we have been about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you get down to the economic fundamentals, you will not create the jobs we need in this country when Australians are not encouraged to save. The greatest dis&hyphen;saver in this country for the last 13 years of Labor government, and particularly for the last six years, the years of the Keating&hyphen;ACTU government, was the Commonwealth government. They had $75 billion of accumulated deficits. They were spending money they did not have, after they had put up taxes and after they had ripped off small business in budget after budget. They put in place the most complex tax laws this country had ever had. Between 1983 and 1994 the tax act tripled in size from 1,300 pages to 3,792 pages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The compliance costs for company tax equalled 22 per cent of the total revenue they got from company tax. It was so expensive for business to comply with the tax laws the government had put in place. The fringe
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> benefits tax was a nightmare. The act was 300&hyphen;pages long. How was small business supposed to cope with that? New Zealand had 50 pages. But, no, the Labor Party needed 300 pages. The capital gains tax compliance costs were also burdening small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On top of all that, you could not stop Paul Keating spending. When the present Leader of the Opposition, the weak Leader of the Opposition, was the Minister for Finance, Paul Keating as Prime Minister trampled right over the top of him and spent up very big indeed&mdash;$75 billion worth of deficits&mdash;and ran Australia into a huge debt. They were the job destroying policies that this government is now coping with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On top of that, of course, Labor completely failed to respond to the changes that were affecting young people in particular&mdash;the huge changes taking place in the youth labour market. Between 1983 and 1996, there was a disappearance right across Australian industry of the unskilled jobs that young Australians dropping out of school early used to get. They let the apprenticeship system die on its feet, because the trade union movement of course liked all those complexities. They were not going to interfere with the apprenticeship system. They were just going to leave it there to die.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Consequently, in 1995, the last year of the Labor Party in government, the number of young people in apprenticeships and traineeships as a proportion of the work force was the lowest for three decades. At the end of 13 years of Labor, 30 per cent of 14 year-olds in this country could not read properly, and that is why small business was finding it so difficult to give these young people jobs. They did not have the literacy skills. They did not have the numeracy skills. They could not work the cash registers. What happened to vocational education and training? Almost nothing was done on it. Nothing was done in schools over the 13 years of the Labor Party government. Vocational education and training went down the drain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the first term of the Howard government, we are spending on vocational education and training in schools almost four times the amount that Labor spent over its entire 13
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3806"> years in government. What was their answer to the problems of young Australians? To pour money into massive, expensive short-term training programs that did not lead to real jobs. They demoralised the young people of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last year of the Labor government, the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) spent $500 million on his new scheme. It had a four per cent success rate. He bought jobs at the cost of $143,000 a job, almost bankrupting the country. And the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) says, `Let's go back to Working Nation. That's what we need for Australia's young people.' Let me say that this government has a commitment to provide young Australians with quality training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The saddest thing I suppose&mdash;I cannot resist pointing this out&mdash;is that if you go around this country and you ask where the biggest problems are they are in Labor Party electorates. Go into the Labor Party electorates in the cities and what used to be the Labor Party electorates in the regions and ask: what did the members do for their constituents over the 13 years they were in power? Some parts of these electorates look like war zones.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did they do in 13 years? There are some people who are unkind enough to suggest that the Labor Party deliberately likes to keep its supporters struggling, because it thinks it can scare them into welfare dependence and then it will tax the rest of the community to provide the benefits and frighten them that the coalition is going to take away all their welfare benefits. It likes its supporters to be poor. Of course, its supporters have realised that, and that is why they turned against the Labor Party in droves. They know that, unless you have a government with the leadership, the courage and the understanding to address the fundamentals, you will never redress these problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first job of the coalition has been to repair the budget, to put an end to the massive spending which destroyed savings and investment in this country. For the second time in a row, in this budget, there was no increase in income tax, no increase in company tax, no increase in wholesale sales tax and no increase in petrol excise. In fact, there
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> were tax reductions. What a different story to the Keating budgets year after year, pumping up taxes and destroying jobs!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, this government got rid of Laurie Brereton's unfair dismissals law. We will begin to see the effects of that over the coming months as the benefits of our new law, our fair legislation, come through. Thirdly, we have reformed the tax system. We have simplified the fringe benefits tax. We have introduced the major reform of the capital gains tax rollover provisions which will be tremendously beneficial to many small businesses as they roll over their funds from one business into another, like business or unlike business&mdash;a major benefit to small businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fourthly, we have put into place major improvements to education and training opportunities for young people, not the short-term programs that lead nowhere&mdash;so beloved by the member for Batman and his cohorts on that side of the House&mdash;but real, decent, quality education that will give young people the basis on which they will get real jobs. The first national literacy plan in the history of this country has been put in place, and every child in this country in grades 3 and 5 will be tested against those national standards. For the first time, we have got commitments to have a look at the literacy level of every child when they come into school and to make the resources available to give those children the skills they need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the first time in this country's history, we will have, under the policies of this government, a national apprenticeship system. This budget provides funding for over 100,000 new apprenticeships and traineeships in the coming year. This government has committed itself to $187 million to expand vocational education and training in schools and to make sure, for the first time, that students have the opportunity to get industry recognised and accredited skills in schools that will lead them on to jobs. We want to give to those students who are dropping out of school something to keep them in school, something relevant&mdash;that they can see is relevant&mdash;that will help them move from school into employment.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3807">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fifthly, we are putting into place a sensible work for the dole scheme. It is not a scheme that is going to manipulate the statistics. That is what that $500 million of the member for Hotham was all about. One effect it had was to redefine the long-term unemployed as short-term unemployed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not coincidental that two days after the budget was presented the opposition raises as a matter of public importance the question of unemployment. We raise that question because we believe that employment and unemployment are important issues. We believe that they are not only important economic issues but also important social issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We just heard a great deal of rhetoric, which we have become accustomed to, from the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp). He has developed a reputation over the years for fudging the figures. His presentation in response to the shadow minister for employment and training, the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson), was another good indication of the way in which the figures can be fudged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After this government's first 12 months&mdash;one&hyphen;third of the way through the term of this government&mdash;he was referring to what they are going to do about apprenticeships. The number of apprenticeships in Australia at present compared with 12 months ago when this government came into office is lower, and the number of traineeships in Australia is lower. These are the sorts of opportunities that the minister and his colleagues on that frontbench, together with their supporters on the backbench, are providing for young Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, you and all members of this parliament and all members of this national community heard in the lead-up to the last election these same people talk about the creation of real jobs. They said that they would cut out the programs&mdash;and they did&mdash;cut out the traineeships and cut out all of those market programs that were so important to tens of thousands of Australians and re

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5A5">Mr ROBERT BROWN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the last 12 months&mdash;in the first third of the first term (and the last term) of this present government&mdash;34,000 more people are unemployed. In March 1997, there were 34,000 more people in Australia unemployed than there were in March 1996, when that government came to power. As well, there are 14,000 more in the ranks of the long-term unemployed. So in both of these areas, whatever the rhetoric, whatever the fudged figures from the minister or members of the coalition, the Australian people want to keep in mind exactly what the first 12 months of this government has meant to them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The budget that was handed down a couple of days ago should have made the question of what this government is going to do to address the problem of unemployment one of its central planks&mdash;and it did nothing. Responsible, informed and competent commentators have also indicated that as far as unemployment is concerned the budget offers nothing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the Labor Party came to government in 1983, unemployment in Australia was almost 11 per cent. When we left government, it was below 8&half; per cent and was edging down. We made as our target a level of five per cent by the end of this decade. After the budget was presented, the commentators indicated quite clearly that the figures that were being presented by the government in connection with the budget were fudged. When they spoke about unemployment coming down to eight per cent at the end of this next 12 months, the commentators said, `No, it will not.' The growth figure that they projected is recognised as being insufficient to bring their 8.7 per cent unemployment down to eight per cent over this next 12 months. The good doctor, Dr Kemp, the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, who just responded to the shadow minister for employment and training, has the responsibility in this chamber for representing his senior minister&mdash;I think the position should be reversed&mdash;from the Senate.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3808">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My colleague the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) referred just a short time ago, by way of a very constructive and useful interjection, to the fact that what we should be doing is referring to the situation which has developed in our area&mdash;in the area of the member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) and the member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris)&mdash;of Newcastle. Let me do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of March, in the Hunter region as a whole, the unemployment rate was 12 per cent. It was up 2.5 per cent in the previous three months. The number unemployed in the Hunter region was 31,000. That had increased by 7,000 in the previous three months. The participation rate in the Hunter was 61 per cent&mdash;one of the lowest in Australia. We might ask ourselves: why were people in the Hunter, unlike people in many other areas of Australia, including those on the lower North Shore, giving up on the prospect of getting a job? Why were they opting out in disillusionment, frustration and despair? Why were they giving up the struggle to find a job? They are giving up the struggle because there are no jobs there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the same proportion of those people who could be in the labour force in the Hunter were looking for jobs as are looking for jobs in the lower North Shore, then there would not be just 31,000 people identified as unemployed in the Hunter; there would be over 60,000. The unemployment rate&mdash;which is officially 12 per cent in the Hunter&mdash;would be not 12 per cent but 21 per cent.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5A5">Mr ROBERT BROWN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He could take Vanstone with him. In fact, it might be better if Vanstone went first. We in the Labor Party believe that when the market mechanism
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> breaks down the responsibility of governments and public policy is to put into place programs that will compensate for that market breakdown. That has not happened as far as the government is concerned. In fact, in the face of the decision that was made by BHP just recently to withdraw from primary steel making in Newcastle, the response of the Prime Minister was, `I'll listen to anyone. They can come to me with their submissions. But I will not intervene.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further than that, the Prime Minister also said that he will visit Newcastle, in effect, to recharge their batteries. He has not had an opportunity, as I am reminded by Laurie Ferguson, Martin's brother, also a member of the Ferguson family which has made more contribution to the welfare of workers in this country than any thousand of the present ministers. The number of people who will now, as a result of that decision by BHP, find themselves unemployed is 2,500 directly in BHP and, of course, the flow-on effect will mean there will be somewhere between 6,000 and 12,000 people in the Hunter region who will be unemployed as a result of that. We are not just talking about 2,500 people losing their jobs; we are talking about 2,500 families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Overnight, when the decision was made by BHP to withdraw from Newcastle, the total share value of BHP increased by $1 billion. Where did that value come from? It came out of the pay envelopes and off the dinner tables of those 2,500 employees of BHP who will lose their jobs. It came, as well, out of 6,000 to 12,000 other individuals and families in the Hunter Valley who are going to be placed in a similar situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was talking as well about the breakdown of the market. This is what happened to those people in Newcastle. In 1983, the output per worker in Newcastle was about 160 tonnes per employee. They were told then that what they needed to do was to achieve an output of 500 tonnes. They achieved it and surpassed it, and it is now over 600 tonnes per employee. But they were told then it had to reach 1,000. In the face of that, BHP announced its withdrawal and this government sat on its hands. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think their time expired a long time ago. The MPI this afternoon, the debate we have had on work for the dole, proves one thing beyond a shadow of a doubt: that this Labor opposition is totally bereft of any fresh ideas, of any approach to the unemployment problem or to any of the difficulties they left this nation with after 13 years of Labor's failures. Thirteen years of Labor failures, and we hear the same rubbish and rhetoric in here this afternoon as we sit through an MPI on work for the dole.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is Labor's answer? Labor's answer is very simple: let us create a big government, the bigger the better. Then let us make big promises, wrap them in all sorts of goodies. Then let us tax big as well. So we tax big; we have big governments; we spend big. We make big promises and we deliver nothing. The next big thing we do is we go out there and whip the media into a frenzy. We come out with all the rhetoric we can come up with to hide the truth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the truth? The truth is you failed the Australian people for 13 years, and if you had your way you would continue to fail them for the next 13 years.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Your budget.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2K6">Mr BROUGH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will come to the budget. Don't let that worry you. One of their answers was the One Nation statement. It sounds a bit like the one notion statement, or the one notion party. We are starting to see these terms reiterated in other forms in this place. They spent some $12&half; billion. That is pretty typical of the Labor Party: tax the workers, tax business, get this big bucket of money and then just throw it at the problem and hope that the problem will be washed away. The only thing that was washed away was the hopes and aspirations of the average Australian person out there who was put onto a merry-go-round of training programs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those training programs did create some things; they created the illusion that unemployment was coming down. The Two Billion Dollar Man, Simon Crean, who overspent in
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the last 12 months in labour market programs, put people into programs that were never going to create a real job for them. He built their aspirations up and then pulled the carpet out from underneath them. That is what he did. In doing so, he artificially deflated the real unemployment problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us go back to the election of 1996 and remember what the public told us out there. `We know the unemployment problem is much worse than the people in the government of the day are telling us, but they do not want to admit the problem.' This government has faced up to the reality. We do not hide people in short-term, worthless, fruitless programs like you did. We now subscribe to a program where labour market programs have real outcomes. New work opportunities: now there is another great little piece.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the minister said earlier, the real net impact was four per cent. Four out of every 100 people who undertook a new work opportunities program achieved a job that would not have been created otherwise. That is a cost of $143,000 per person. I would say that perhaps even the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) would be able to find a few jobs for people if someone put $143,000 per job into his pocket. But all he was able to do as the ACTU President was lose those jobs. He was very good at that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So let us just look at the budget on Tuesday night. What it did was not throw a bucket of money at this problem and hope that it would go away. We did not try to cloak it in mirrors and smoke. What we did was go to the actual structural problems that this country was left with after 13 years of Labor. Now I do not expect you to believe me. So let us look at the comments&mdash;some of which the Prime Minister has already stated today&mdash;from different industry groups. The Chief Executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry said:</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Small business&mdash;that is something you would not know too much about&mdash;the single biggest employer in this country, and here they are saying that what was in the budget was good for them and good for employment, which is good for the unemployed people of Australia whom you left as a legacy of your 13 years.

<PARA STYLE="Para">This is a job destroying tax&mdash;high taxing, high spending, big government. There it is again; state, local and federal&mdash;you cannot get away from it. That is all that you have ever been good at.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us have a look at some of the programs. In my own electorate of Longman, which is a beautiful part of the world, we have gone a long way towards working with the community to address the problem of unemployment. No longer do we shove the unemployed into short&hyphen;term programs, hope that no-one sees them and that they are forgotten. We are having the community work with them. The Caboolture area schools industry links scheme&mdash;CASTLES as it is known&mdash;which is part of the school&hyphen;to&hyphen;work program has been successful throughout Australia in a number of locations, including Labor strongholds such as Port Adelaide. Here we have business working with schools to ensure that young people have every opportunity from the very start to get into the workplace. They understand what work is about and, more importantly, business also starts to understand the young person. That is a great initiative which involves the community. The Marsden school has picked up on the pathways program. They have almost completed their first stages which have been wonderfully successful. Approximately 150 young people deserted by Labor were picked up through an innovative program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us face it&mdash;your programs did not work. All you have said today is, `Let's have more of the same.' It looks good in the press. It looks good on the front pages of the paper&mdash;`X billion spent on One Nation.'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the debate just finished on the matter of public importance, the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, Dr Kemp, told the House that we have deep, entrenched unemployment. It is entrenched, I would suggest, by economic policies that are not working particularly to the benefit of those who do not happen to be shareholders and do not happen to be part of that sector of the economy that is doing particularly well. In that downsized economy, where thousands of jobs have been shed, these people are victims of a policy of four per cent growth. For the first time in our history, it is non&hyphen;jobs growth. That is certainly not a situation peculiar to Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let's not blame the unemployed for their own fate. Let's encourage them to be creative
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3813"> with this work for the dole project. Let's not marginalise them even further by referring to `these people' whom `this community' expects to participate, because these people are very much part&mdash;as I said earlier&mdash;of this community. Let's get creative and look at something like the Alberta welfare reforms. I would urge the government to take a look at these.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mike Cardinal, MLA for that particular province in Canada, came up with this scheme in 1991. He later became the Minister of Alberta Family and Social Services and immediately set out to reform the entire welfare system. His philosophy was that people wanted to work; any job was a good job. Training was the key. That is something that is noticeably absent from this work for the dole project, despite the very strong suggestion from the Prime Minister on the day he announced it&mdash;in the way I referred to earlier: off the hip,  not very confident about it&mdash;he did say, or strongly suggested, that there would be a training component.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1995&hyphen;96, due to the Alberta Community Employment program, 67 per cent of welfare recipients no longer depended on welfare one year after completing the ACE program. In 1995&hyphen;96, under the Alberta Job Corps program, 78 per cent of welfare clients no longer depended on welfare one year after completing the program. Again, in 1995&hyphen;96, under the Employment Skills Program, 70 per cent of welfare clients no longer received welfare one year after completing the program. I wonder whether these initiatives in Canada have been carefully studied. If so, why aren't some of the components of that highly successful program included in this program which, I believe, offers very little?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Youth groups associated with this program say in their submissions to the minister that to talk about compulsion is entirely counterproductive. The Australian Youth Action Coalition is not supportive of the concept, especially the compulsory participation. The Brotherhood of St Laurence do not support the scheme if participation is compulsory. The Catholic Social Welfare Commission says that the scheme should not be compulsory. The Council of Social Service is not supportive of
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> compulsion. The Salvation Army has similar views to the above. Compulsion is the thing that should not be part of this scheme if it is going to be acceptable in any way to the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are thousands of people out there who would line up for a scheme if it was creatively formatted. What we need is training. As I said, there is no sign of it. We need a complete review of our economic strategy in this country. Again, the government might refer to the comments of Dr Michael Crawford, a leading management consultant, who, in a circular late last year, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Australia's conventional economic wisdom is well overdue for some reality checking. The experiences of the last forty years do not support the economic theories followed by recent governments, including the current one. Until those economic theories are scrapped, Australia's economic performance will be abysmal, with low growth and high unemployment.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">. . . until the government introduces some very different economic policies, plan on 8%&hyphen;9% unemployment to go with 3%&hyphen;4% inflation . . . While we have been reducing tariff protection against imports, we have been providing subsidies to exports . . . This is now beset with problems . . . Reduction of those subsidies will inevitably curtail the growth of our exports, increasing the need to limit imports share.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He finishes up by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">So, given the international trade policies pursued by successive governments&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">this and the previous one&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">any approximation to a reasonable balance of payments can only be achieved if Australia retains, and even increases, its unemployment rate.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is the sort of problem that is giving us this deep and entrenched unemployment to which the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) refers. He, at best, can blame the former government but he is not coming up with anything that is substantially creative enough in soaking up those people who cannot be part of that increased prosperity and growth that we are supposed to be enjoying.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The outcome from this program need not be a job. There has been too much focus on the outcome being a job at the end of it. The jobs are not there. We need to have people feeling
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3814"> that they belong, we need them to be skilled at the end of it and we have to have a healing of the `them and us' divide which is creating a huge social problem in this country. It is tearing away at the fabric of our society. It is creating the attitudes that have led to the formation of the party of my colleague who sits next to me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot believe that people, when they get laid off from Newcastle, might not be tempted to march down the road to sign up for those movements with no answer to our problems. Certainly, the sorts of questions they are asking are the sorts of questions they are hearing nowhere else. That is the danger, unless we create a program in this country to soak up the 30 per cent of kids who have not got work out there. Ten thousand work for the dole positions will not do it. There is no training there and nothing worth while. And all we can do is blame them for their position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is bankrupt of any morality, and both sides of politics can sit and argue all they like, but they have got to get their heads together and come up with something that has real guts that people can believe in or we are going to see a continuation of this sort of movement and we are going to rue the day we did not address the basic problems that created this. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for Calare (Mr Andren) is obviously sincere in what he says, and perhaps his plea for both sides of politics to get together to address the unemployment problem is a genuine one. It also may be a good one, because unemployment is this country's major problem as it comes into the year 2000 and the next century. The figures as they are today&mdash;8.7 per cent&mdash;are enough to shame any government. But, unfortunately, Australia does not face this problem of high unemployment alone. It is endemic around the world&mdash;particularly in Europe. At the same time, I note that the US has a current unemployment rate of 4.9 per cent, and I will refer to that later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In opening, may I say that I support work for the dole, and I always have. When I first came to this parliament, one of the first things I did was ask David Connolly, who was then
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the shadow minister for social security, why we could not have a work for the dole program. His reply was that it was too expensive. The costing had been done, and he did not think it was worthy of the expense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had been a strong supporter because, prior to entering parliament, I had worked for the South Australian Health Commission. I am a psychologist by training, but most of my work has been in research. I did a needs study of an area that later became the seat of Hawker&mdash;later to be abolished. As part of that needs study, I concentrated on youth. The study was divided into several parts, and one of them was looking at the needs of youth in the area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We looked at all sorts of things to do with youth&mdash;drug taking, health needs&mdash;but the big problem, even then, was unemployment. I remember I was invited one day by a youth worker to come to see some of the kids who hung out on a vacant lot near Westfield shopping centre. I met him, and he took me to meet these kids.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A rougher bunch of kids you would have a hard job finding. The smell that was hanging around the trees where they were sitting was quite unmistakable, and they were happily&mdash;or perhaps I should say `unhappily'&mdash;sitting there, smoking marijuana and looking extremely tough. I sat down and talked to them for quite some time. I asked them what I, as somebody who was doing a needs survey, could do for them, and they said, `Find us jobs.' That was general amongst these kids, who were, as I said, the tougher looking kids. They were the sorts of kids that you would try to avoid if you went down the street, because you would wonder what was in their mind. In fact, all that was in their mind was a job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At that time I thought that, if they did not have a job, at least working for the dole would give them something to do with their day and would get them out of what happens to you when you become long-term unemployed. That was also part of the study that I did&mdash;looking at the effects of health on the long-term unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You probably would be aware of the vicious circle that being unemployed engenders:
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3815"> your self&hyphen;esteem goes down and depression comes on; the lower your self&hyphen;esteem, the greater the depression, the less appealing you are to a potential employer and the less likely you are to get a job. The cycle goes spiralling down and usually ends with people having serious health defects. We also know that it can end in young people committing suicide because of the general lack of hope that they have and the state of their life cycle. Just the ability to get out and meet other people makes a tremendous difference to that. It can lift people's spirits no end to be out there doing something and achieving something and to feel that, at the end of the day, they have done a good day's work. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Sydney (Mr Peter Baldwin) said that he disliked the term. He commented that it was an overwhelmingly pejorative term. I do not see it as that; I see it as what it is. I suspect that the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) agreed with him because he suggested that we change the name. Work for the dole is what it is and we should not be ashamed of that&mdash;there is nothing to be ashamed of. It provides an outlet for young people who are unemployed and have nowhere else to go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister for education made it clear that this is not an employment program. It is not a substitute for employment; it is what it says it is&mdash;simply working for the dole. In that I think it can do a lot of good because it can provide somewhere for young people to go, young people who really get tied up with staying at home and with the absolute tearing apart that goes on after they apply day after day for jobs and do not get an answer. In the end they really do stop applying. I would like to give my full support to this program, while acknowledging that it is not an answer to what is now Australia's major problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem, as I have said, is endemic in Europe, as well as in Australia, although it is interesting to note that the UK's unemployment rate has come down&mdash;I think mostly because they have very much followed the path of the United States. Also, the Netherlands are doing some interesting things inasmuch as they are looking at various countries to see what is working.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to the member for Calare that I am not aware of the program in Alberta, and I certainly would be interested to look it up. However, I would ask him whether the figures he gave us were self&hyphen;selected figures, that is, were the people selected the ones most likely to benefit or were the people randomly selected? If it was the latter, then they are very impressive results indeed, and I would be interested to look at them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last week the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia appeared before the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Financial Institutions and Public Administration and was questioned quite closely about unemployment and what he saw as the future. The governor made it very clear that he divided it into two areas: growth in GDP and structural growth. He said that he could not see growth in GDP bringing a decrease in unemployment of more than perhaps 2.7 per cent. He was talking about good sustained growth to the end of the century. He said that, if we really want to bring down our unemployment rate, we have to look to structural adjustment. Of course, in that he meant greater flexibility in the workplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is aiming to bring about flexibility so that the workers and those who are supplying the jobs can better fit together and not be constrained by outmoded rules and regulations that make people fit into a system designed a long time ago. We have to free it up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would hope that the Governor of the Reserve Bank was not suggesting that we would go totally down the American road, although, when you look at the American statistics, you will see that they are extremely impressive. In about the 1980s our unemployment rate was about six per cent and theirs was 7.2 per cent. They are now down to 4.9 per cent and we are up to 8.7 per cent. While their unemployment rate has gone down, ours has increased. The OECD has put that this is a result of greater flexibility in the US market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I believe that market has extreme flexibility, and it has come at a great cost. If you have a look at the prison population in the US, you will find that, since 1980, it has
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3816"> actually tripled. I believe the figure is something like 379 per 100,000. In Australia in the same period it has gone from something like 68 to 88, so it has increased by a third. There is a huge difference in that country, and I suspect that that is not a statistic that we would like to copy. I cannot say that that rise in crime or in prison population is a result of that extreme flexibility in the United States, but I would be surprised if there was not some connection between the two.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the member for Calare said, we have to look to creating new jobs for the unemployed. We have to have some fairly inventive ideas to do that. I did notice in the newspaper some weeks ago a little item which I believe said that in France now they are offering a tax deduction to families who pay people to work in the home. I thought that was an excellent idea but, if we do that, we have to get rid of some of the prejudices we have in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We went through a period in our history when the schools were teaching the pupils, `Don't settle for a second-rate job. There are good jobs and there are bad jobs. You go for the good jobs, forget the bad jobs.' I think that was one of the cruellest things they could have ever done because work is good. There are no such things as good jobs and bad jobs; there is only the way you do those jobs. So we have to look at the possibility of creating new jobs in Australia where we did not have them before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our manufacturing sector is reducing its requirement, and hopefully it is not because it is closing down but because of the technological advances. I remember going into a factory in Queensland where they used to have 80 people on the floor. It is a wood factory. There is now one person sitting in a computerised chair and that one person moves around pressing buttons directing where each of the logs are to go. He replaced 80 people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the problem that we are facing at the end of this century. We have had a technological revolution. We have to go back and say, `This is akin to the Industrial Revolution,' but hopefully we are more of a civilised society now than they were then and we will
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> take on our responsibility to our unemployed and see that they do have employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the responsibilities of government is to provide jobs for the people in the society because work now has come so that it defines a person. We ask somebody their name, where they live, what they do. We as a government and as a society must take on that responsibility to provide jobs. We need to provide not just jobs but an equitable society because the last thing we need is to go back to the times of the Industrial Revolution when there was an enormous gap between the rich and the poor. There are signs that that does seem to be happening in this society when we see salaries of millions and millions of dollars going to executives of companies while average weekly wages stay at just incredibly small amounts of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We cannot have a two&hyphen;tiered society, but we must have a society that does offer jobs to those who want them. While we are reaching that end, the work for the dole scheme, while not an answer for everyone, would at least provide some outlet for those young people who have been caught in that unemployment spiral. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As someone who has spent some years working with unemployed young people and long-term unemployed young people, I feel that I have something to contribute to this debate on the government's proposed work for the dole scheme or, as one young constituent in my electorate described it, the government's community service order without crime legislation. The accepted mythology in this place is that the work for the dole scheme has widespread support. That is based largely on anecdotals from the media, from the minister and from members opposite. A recent survey conducted in my electorate by the youth unemployed task force demonstrates that the majority of young people in my electorate reject it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only real opportunity the government had to demonstrate that this proposition had popular support was to announce it before the last election so that a proper debate could be had about it and the detail of the scheme could be assessed and debated thoroughly.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3817"> They did not do that. In fact, they specifically ruled it out. They specifically said that they would not be introducing such a scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real challenge for youth unemployment, as has been acknowledged on my side of the House and sometimes on the other, is the creation of real jobs, not mickey mouse schemes, for unemployed people. Since this government was elected, 34,000 more people have joined the ranks of the unemployed. As previous speakers have pointed out, there are fewer apprentices and trainees than there were previously when Labor left office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The work for the dole scheme is predicated on a fairly simple and weary and old political strategy that can only lead to bad public policy. It is a strategy which tries to convince people that it is the fault of the unemployed, it is the fault of the people who find themselves economically and socially dispossessed, that they are so. Rather than confront the contradictions in our economy, rather than confront the difficult decisions which actually deliver solutions which create employment and sustained economic growth, we seek to introduce these sorts of schemes which lead the community to believe that it is the unemployed's fault that they are so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dr Kemp and others have made great speeches saying how popular this proposal is. They have suggested that the vast majority of young people support the proposal. Why then make it compulsory? Why make it compulsory if it has such widespread support? The reason they are making it compulsory is to introduce an idea into the minds of the public that it is the unemployed's fault that they are unemployed, that they do not get off their backsides. We have heard a lot of claptrap about instilling a work ethic. The fact of the matter is there are more people who would like to work than there are jobs available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">BHP is an example of this dynamic. It is fiddling while Rome burns. Thousands of people are losing their jobs and the government refuses to intervene and do anything about it. Fiddling while Rome burns is an apt analogy, particularly for the ACT&mdash;perhaps the ACT is being torched while the government is fiddling. In the public sector, 16,500 jobs will be lost as a result of the budget that
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> has just been handed down&mdash;16,500 very competent, hardworking and dedicated public servants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous speaker, the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), said that it is the role of government to create jobs. That was one of her statements. I agree with her: it is the role of government to create jobs where the private sector is not doing so and where the government lacks the fortitude to intervene in the market to ensure that there is sustainable development. It is not the role of government, in my view, to add misery to misery by getting rid of another 16,500 workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The strategy of blaming the unemployed gets government off the hook. It allows the government to pursue an economic strategy that is predicated on high unemployment. In my view, this government's strategy is predicated on high unemployment. The compulsory element of the scheme illustrates that scapegoating is occurring.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Scapegoating is a favoured strategy used by the right wing of politics and the ultra right wing of politics. It is a strategy adopted indeed by fascist parties that says blame the immigrant, blame the unemployed, blame the Aboriginal, blame the student, blame the public servant, blame anyone but those who are responsible&mdash;those with the power to make improvements, the public and the private sectors. It is not surprising, therefore, that I hear young people describe this scheme to me as community service orders without the crime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us debunk some of the misconceptions about the scheme. The scheme does not apply to just young unemployed people, it applies to all age groups. The scheme will not just be used in the community sector. Indeed, a lot of the examples member opposite have used that will be good for this scheme to adopt have engaged the community sector. The reality is that the private sector equally can use the scheme to replace their own waged employees. The boss will not have to pay anything to the person at all. No occupation is exempted. In fact the scope of the program is virtually unlimited, except for the 10,000 cap.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3818">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation provides for the secretary to the department to approve work schemes, but there are no guidelines for the secretary to include or exclude projects&mdash;no age guideline, no anti-exploitation guideline, no appeal process. There will be no health and safety protection at all for work for the dole conscripts. There will be no workers compensation protection for the conscripts. The conscripts will not be paid in accordance with the award. The government has selected the wrong rate&mdash;a lower rate of pay that is not appropriate&mdash;because the lower rate of pay in the award is in exchange for real training. That is not provided in the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the boss can engage a conscript for free, with no wages and with no safety or training responsibility, then I believe Australian workers have a lot to fear from this legislation because it will be tempting for some employers to terminate their waged employees in order to attract conscripts. I hope this does not occur, but I think there are unscrupulous employers who will be tempted to do this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ten thousand jobs are threatened by this legislation, whether they be professional, para&hyphen;professional, trade, non-trade, skilled or semi&hyphen;skilled workers. All of these people are threatened by this legislation, and sacking the existing waged workers is made all the easier under Reith's unfair dismissal laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we say that the scheme should not displace existing workers. And what is wrong with that? Why is the government opposing the opposition on that simple proposition if it does not intend to encourage the irresponsible employers to sack waged employees to put conscripts on?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The scheme should not displace prospective workers either. This is affected by a requirement that organisations contracting to provide employment projects must state the proportion of people who will obtain permanent employment following the placement. Future contracts should be based on the performance against these commitments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some speakers opposite have said that this is impractical, but the position is that employers should not get away with operating their business on the back of free labour to the exclusion of paid employment. If the govern
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment lets them do this, the prospect for unemployed people to obtain work becomes even more bleak. Nothing would prevent a labour hire company, for example, from engaging free labour from the work for the dole conscription program and then hiring them out to a factory for a fee&mdash;and of course that would do jobs over in the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government must ensure that the people concerned are covered by workers comp and relevant safety legislation. Perhaps that is why the conservative end of politics in earlier years thought this sort of proposal would be too expensive, because in the old days they had some commitment to workers comp and safety legislation. They thought they should foot the bill. However, the scheme does not provide for workers comp in the event of injury.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I went to a big meeting of young people recently with a few other colleagues, and we asked the young people what they thought about work for the dole. At first blush, many hands went up supporting the proposal. Then we said, `How many of you would support work for the dole if you didn't have health and safety protection?' About 50 per cent of the original hands went up. Then we said, `How many of you would support work for the dole if it could be replacing paid employment&mdash;that is, the employer does not have a prohibition on terminating a waged employee to put on a conscript?' No hands went up. In the absence of the detail on first blush, many people thought this would be a great idea, but the devil is in the detail and, in my view, it is Dickensian.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government were seriously suggesting that the scheme would deliver the goods for the unemployed, then it would set targets for its success. It will not do it. It will not set targets for its success because it knows it will fail. I agree with AYPAC&mdash;the peak youth organisation in this nation&mdash;which concluded that work for the dole and compulsion do not work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So Labor amendments to this legislation may be successful or they may not. It is imperative for the government to feel committed to do something about unemployment, so it is imperative that scapegoating strategies
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3819"> fail. It is imperative that the community does not start to blame the unemployed, does not start to blame migrants and does not start to blame Aboriginal people for the social and economic dislocation which they are engaged in. Replacing employees with unwaged conscripts is Dickensian and, in my view, will be rejected by the community, if not the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did anticipate that the previous speaker, the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Dargavel), would have spoken for a few more minutes, but it is pretty clear that he ran out of steam on a bill&mdash;the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Work for the Dole) Bill&mdash;about which he professes to have a great deal of passion. I think it is very disappointing for the Australian people to hear the Labor Party, which was overwhelmingly rejected at the last election, seek to criticise and condemn what this government is doing: that is, bringing in an innovative scheme which will give people, principally the young, the opportunity of working for the dole. In doing so, they will obtain a work ethic, and also make a substantial ongoing contribution to the community.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a comprehensive range of solutions. Unemployment is not an easy problem to solve but at least this government, unlike its predecessor, has brought forward suggestions and ideas. We know that young people are a very important resource for this nation. We do not think that it is acceptable that 30 per cent of them should be thrown on the job scrap heap. We do not believe the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp), who is at the table, should  throw his hands up in the air, as did his
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> predecessor, and say, `It is all too hard.' This government has announced a range of programs and training to be a pathway to real long&hyphen;term employment. The former government used to look at a placement in a training program as being a successful outcome. However, we consider only a real long-term job as being a successful outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to join the debate on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Work for the Dole) Bill. We do not see our initiative as being a panacea for solving all of the problems of youth unemployment, but we consider it important that government give the lead in setting up a framework, an infrastructure, to provide young people with the opportunity of having a sense of self&hyphen;worth in making a contribution to the community. Unfortunately, long&hyphen;term unemployment without any chance of a job destroys self&hyphen;esteem and brings about a whole range of other social problems, including family breakdown and a very high level of youth suicide. To avoid this we need to create jobs, and create an environment where people are able to get into work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The aim of the work for the dole initiative is to help young people remain motivated while they are looking for work. It is not a replacement for work, but is designed to create a work ethic to make young people employable, to give them the opportunity of getting one foot on the employment ladder. We aim to help to make sure that they do not feel left out by society the way the Labor Party shunned 30 per cent of our young people. I think that was very sad.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government believes that it is fair and reasonable that people receiving unemployment allowances from the community be asked to make a contribution to the community in return. Arrangements for work for the dole projects are currently being developed and, most importantly, the minister has pointed out that pilot projects will be located primarily in areas of high youth unemployment in rural and regional Australia. And the Sunshine Coast, an area that I am proud to represent, is an ideal location for a pilot project because we have chronic high youth unemployment. The minister was no doubt as
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3820"> heartened as I was at the outstanding response his scheme received when it was announced. A story in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunshine Coast Daily</EMPHASIS> of 16 February had `Scheme attracts hearty support' as a headline. I quote from the paper:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The Federal Government's proposal to impose a compulsory work for the dole scheme has gained widespread support on the Sunshine Coast.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Later the article goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The proposal attracted the almost universal support of the general public&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">and so on&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">while the Coast's conservative politicians were predictably in favour of the scheme.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">But the fact of the matter is that employed people and unemployed people right across the Sunshine Coast saw this as being a worthwhile idea. It is an attempt by the government to give young people a chance, yet we find those opposite&mdash;who are negative, who for 13 years did absolutely nothing to create opportunities for young people&mdash;are now not supporting this government's initiative. I want to highlight a report from the same newspaper where a young unemployed person aged 17 is referred to, Andrew Roberts. The paper says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Andrew has been unemployed for more than six months since leaving school during Year 12.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">He said he would welcome the chance to work for the dole.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">`I wouldn't mind doing it. It would be good. I hate being unemployed, it's boring.'</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I found that the response of Andrew was similar to the attitude of so many other young people right across the nation. The minister at the table, and in my view he is one of the very best ministers in the government, has brought forward this program which the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) announced. It is fairly clear that the community is on side, it is obvious that unemployed people are supportive, but once again we find that the Labor Party is out of step. Once again we find that the Labor Party is a group refusing to recognise that it ought to be supporting the program brought in by the work for the dole initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is vital to recognise that work for the dole projects will be of value to the community. Young unemployed people will obtain work values. I challenge the honourable
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> member opposite to tell me how he feels when he speaks to young people who have been unemployed for a number of years. They would no doubt tell him, as they tell me, that there is no point in getting out of bed. If they do get out of bed, they might drift around with friends. Some of them fall into crime and a lot of them watch television. At the end of the day, if and when they apply for work, they are less employable. We aim to create a sense of self&hyphen;worth and a work ethic. Projects will be of lasting value not only to the participants but also to the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not looking at this as a slash and burn program. We do not aim to save money through the work for the dole scheme. Some pilot projects in rural and remote areas may cost as much as several thousands of dollars per participant in addition to the unemployment allowance payments. This government is making a genuine attempt to assist young people. The priority group for the pilot projects will be those aged under 25 years and who have been in receipt of unemployment allowances for at least six months. However, work for the dole pilots will not be restricted to that age group. People aged 25 years or more will be considered for some pilot projects. It is very important to recognise that unemployment in this country is not limited to those under the age of 25 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Fraser quite incorrectly peppered his whole speech with the term `conscripts'. Personally, I find that offensive. I think that is inaccurate and entirely inappropriate. If he wants to oppose the government's policy, let him get up and do so, but in speaking out against what we are saying, as is his democratic right, he should at least keep to the truth. The fact of the matter is that we will not have conscripts. Referral to pilot projects will be, as much as possible, voluntary. However, if the response from volunteers does not provide enough participants, then eligible clients will be compulsorily referred. Referral of eligible clients to projects could involve a strategy which ensures that a mix of clients, all of whom would have been unemployed for at
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3821"> least six months but for a different duration, is included.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Participants will continue to receive their unemployment allowance payment and they will work a set number of hours to earn it. Those hours will be determined having regard to relevant awards. Most participants will work in the order of two days per week. They will be paid for it, and they will have plenty of opportunity to continue to look for work. The other three days will be used to look for a real long-term job in the workplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A criticism of the scheme is a claim that training is not involved. The Labor Party is the last group in Australia which should talk about training. Let us look at their training programs. They placed a lot of people in training program after training program, seeking to give them some skills for jobs which simply did not exist in the community. When I was doorknocking in Caboolture prior to the 1993 election, a person said to me, `Look, I have been to eight training programs.' But at the end of the day he was still out of work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The work for the dole initiative will give people the opportunity to work at the workplace. In doing so, they will obtain practical training that will fit them out for a real long&hyphen;term job when they successfully obtain one. The initiative is different from the previous government's programs in that participants will still be recognised by the government as being unemployed and would still be required to look for work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Work for the dole is not designed to artificially manipulate the measured rate of youth unemployment. The initiative is expected to have little, if any, effect on the reported youth unemployment level. We all know how the former government placed people in training schemes at critical times in the political cycle so as to depress artificially the official rate of unemployment. What they did was dishonest. Our scheme will give people a work ethic and enable them to make a contribution to this country at a time when they would otherwise be sitting at home and not working.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that, in exchange for the dole, people ought to make such a contribution. Does the Labor Party believe that people
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ought to receive payments and then not go out to work? This scheme we are looking at is a win-win&hyphen;win situation. There is a win for the community because the projects involved will have long-term benefits. We will create a pool of employable people. When employers advertise in newspapers, they will get people who understand what getting up and going to work is like. Employers will not waste their time interviewing people who simply do not understand how important it is to be prepared to work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another benefit of this scheme for the community is that the social problems associated with unemployment will be reduced. If young people are active, motivated and happy within themselves, obviously the levels of family breakdown, youth homelessness and certainly crime we have experienced in the past will be reduced. So the scheme will provide ancillary benefits to the community generally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, we are all aware of the very high level of youth suicide in this nation. As Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs, an all&hyphen;party committee, I inform the House we recently held a seminar on the topic `Aspects of Youth Suicide', opened by the Prime Minister. It is very clear that social problems in this country are contributing to the number of young people lost to youth suicide. If we can create a greater sense of self-worth in our young people, then obviously we will take a step towards reducing the level of youth suicide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said that there is benefit to the community. There is clearly benefit to the young person. Young people will see that, by learning to understand that an employer expects a fair day's work for a fair day's pay, when they go for a job they will be in a much stronger position to be able to gain work. I employed people for many years in my legal practice. I know that if someone came to me who had worked for the dole under the program suggested by the minister then that person would have been an infinitely more employable person than someone who had been out of work for a number of years and
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3822"> who in fact had lost the idea of what work was all about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been handed a note from the whip saying that I am to speak for only 15 minutes. So the other five minutes of pearls and gems which I was going to cast forth will have to remain unuttered at this time. But, in summing up, I want to point out that this program is one of the most imaginative programs that any government has ever introduced. I know that we are having only a certain number of pilots to start with, but personally I would like to see this scheme expanded right throughout the nation. I think that this is very important. The minister should be commended. Those people opposite, who failed for the last 13 years, stand condemned because, instead of saying, `This is a great idea, we'll back you 100 per cent,' their negativity is coming out yet again. They are the last people to criticise this government for coming forward with innovative solutions.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Why is the House debating the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Work for the Dole) Bill? We are debating this bill for two reasons. The first is that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) was caught out misleading the Ray Martin program concerning the extent of his knowledge of AFP investigations into his former colleague Senator Woods. He got into such strife over misleading the Ray Martin program&mdash;it is one thing to mislead parliament, but to mislead the Ray Martin program is another thing altogether&mdash;that he became desperate for anything to take the heat of that particular issue.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UK6">Mr KELVIN THOMSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You should go home and change your tie. The second reason we have this bill before us this afternoon is that the government wants to come up with its own pretend solution to unemployment&mdash;this Clayton's solution to unemployment from a government which has run up the white flag of surrender where jobs are concerned; a
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> directionless government which has no fair dinkum solution to unemployment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Treasurer (Mr Costello), in his televised speech on the budget, mentioned the word `unemployment' only once. For the first time in living memory a budget speech failed to disclose the record on jobs and on growth for the past year. The reason why was simple enough. The Treasurer predicted last year that he would bring the unemployment rate down to 8&frac14; per cent. Instead, it has risen to 8&frac34; per cent. The most recent figures show that nearly a quarter of a million people are now long-term unemployed&mdash;a 23&hyphen;month high. The economic growth which was forecast for next year, despite the pick&hyphen;up in the world economy, comes in at just 3&frac34; per cent&mdash;still under the four per cent which the Prime Minister and everybody else accept is necessary for any genuine, serious reduction in unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have another 16,500 Public Service jobs to go next year. There are no job creation schemes worth the name. There is no restoration of the labour market programs which were savaged last year. They are so crucial for job readiness and training in skills. There are no new regional programs worth having and, indeed, there is a further assault on export promotion spending.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my own electorate of Wills and in the area of the north&hyphen;western suburbs of Melbourne we are seeing alarming employment statistics after a year of this government in office. The latest Bureau of Statistics data reveal a fall in the number of people employed in the north&hyphen;west statistical region to 104,600. That is 4,300 fewer people in work in this region than in the previous month and over 16,000 fewer than a year ago. Those latest figures mean that jobs have disappeared quicker in the north&hyphen;west region than in any other part of metropolitan Melbourne. We have had a change during the past year, from April 1996 to April 1997, of 16,000 fewer people in work. That is a 13.7 per cent drop. So unemployment in the north&hyphen;western suburbs of Melbourne has risen and we are now the jobs black spot of Melbourne.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that the government needs to change its job destroying policies of public
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3823"> sector job shedding and cuts in support for manufacturing industry. We urgently need a change in policy. Instead, what we get is the work for the dole scheme with its shabby and demeaning title, which the opposition will certainly seek to amend.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister, in his announcement, spoke of mutual obligation between the community and unemployed people. Let me say right out front that I have no problem with mutual obligation or reciprocal obligation&mdash;the obligation of unemployed people to look for work and to make their services available to the community in these sorts of ways. The Labor Party indeed pioneered the term `reciprocal obligation' in its job compact between the government and the unemployed as part of the Working Nation jobs programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But reciprocal obligation is a two&hyphen;way street. The government has obligations also to create real training opportunities and jobs for the unemployed. But this mutual obligation takes the government out of the equation. What we have is the slashing of $1.8 billion from properly paid and structured labour market programs getting unemployed people job ready and getting unemployment down. We have a government whose cuts to labour market programs have meant that an estimated 117,000 young unemployed people have lost access to these programs. Those opposite have the nerve to come in here and say, `Look at us. We want a pat on the back. We're introducing a work for the dole scheme for 10,000 people,' yet they have cut places for 117,000 young unemployed people. Make no mistake, this is a mickey mouse program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Work for the dole projects will not provide proper training. They are not even designed to lead to a real job. The people participating in the projects will not have the protection of the Occupational Health and Safety Act, the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act or the Workplace Relations Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under this government, the overall unemployment rate and the youth unemployment rate have both risen, reversing their downward trend under Labor. What we have here is a scheme simply designed to divert attention from the government's complete failure to deliver on its promise to generate real jobs for
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> young people and, indeed, divert attention from other scandals which were besetting the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In their view, unemployment is a problem only for taxpayers. If people are working for the dole, taxpayers will feel happier about their taxes contributing to the jobsearch allowance or unemployment benefits, and therefore the problem is solved and will go away. But unemployment is much more than that. It is a problem&mdash;a most serious problem&mdash;for the unemployed themselves. It does lead to increases in crime, it does lead to family breakdown and it does lead to suicide, as other speakers have mentioned. It is also a problem for the nation in that we fail to utilise our productive capacity. This is no solution for the problem of unemployment at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This kind of solution is not acceptable not only to the Labor Party but also to leaders of Australian churches, who have pointed out that work for the dole risks deploying youth as cheap labour and has the debilitating image of earning handouts. To this end, we will be proposing amendments designed to make this a genuine, fair dinkum labour market program which the community could indeed be proud of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that the scheme must not displace existing workers. We believe that resources need to be made available to enable payment activity at the relevant national training wage award rate. We believe that participants should be guaranteed accredited on&hyphen; or off&hyphen;the&hyphen;job training within the work activity, that appropriate case management and supervision should be available to all participants to assist them making decisions about opportunities under work for the dole arrangements. We think that participants need to be able to leave the scheme, to accept employment opportunities without penalty and that access to financial assistance ought to be available to potential employers to cover costs such as supervision and materials. Through these sorts of amendments, this program can be turned into something worth while which, presently, regrettably, it is not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only does the bill do nothing to address the underlying causes of unemployment, but
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3824"> also its other genesis comes from the opinion polls. The Prime Minister(Mr Howard) and the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) have declared to the House that the government is encouraged by strong public support. I have to say that I and many other members have received a lot of negative feedback from young people who want to know why the government feels compelled to beat them up. They want to know why the government does not believe that they are searching earnestly for work when they spend a great many hours each week applying for jobs, interviews and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This comes from a party which has a great fascination with public opinion polling. We have seen a bevy of ministers denouncing the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) in recent days, not because anything she said in recent days was extraordinary by her standards, but because Liberal Party technocrats had examined the polls and concluded that not to say anything might lead Australians to believe that the Prime Minister was weak and vacillating. Well it might! Like Rasputin, the pollsters have the Prime Minister and his cabinet in a trance. It is those same technocrats who informed the Prime Minister at the height of the Bob Woods affair that something was needed to distract media attention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the heart of the work for the dole bill is a belief by a lot of people on the other side of the chamber that people who are on the dole do not look hard enough for work. That is simply not my experience. My experience is that there are simply not enough jobs around for a lot of people who are serious and sincere in their desire to find work. Many on the other side have allowed themselves to support this bill not because they believe that it will genuinely address unemployment but because they know that it is driven by opinion polls. They are as desperate as the Prime Minister to see the government's flagging popularity restored. Just because something is&mdash;to quote the fictional <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Frontline </EMPHASIS>producer&mdash;sexy, does not mean that it is good policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By supporting this bill, members opposite are pandering to base politics. It will do nothing to solve unemployment, and they
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> know it. It is simply a smokescreen, a mask, to enable them to claim that they are doing something about unemployment and, as such, it is a disgraceful tactic and one which Liberal and National Party members should have no part of. At the same time that the Prime Minister is finally castigating the member for Oxley over her politics on race, he is engaging in the same baseline political tactics on unemployment&mdash;and we wonder how he manages to stay relaxed and comfortable with this duplicity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill before the House does absolutely nothing for unemployed Australians. It will not create one additional job. It will create additional bureaucratic red tape, but it will not create a single constructive job which adds wealth to this nation. It is ironic, and indeed tragic, that the government is introducing this bill at the same time that its poor record on employment is becoming clearer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I indicated earlier, we have seen jobs shrinking in the north-west and certainly no action is being taken by this government which will provide lasting work of value to people in my electorate. What I believe the government needs to do is to reverse the job cutting policies which it has engaged in over the course of the past year. It needs to restore the Working Nation programs, which were getting unemployment down to five per cent by the year 2000. It needs to provide fair dinkum support to manufacturing industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is regrettable that its cuts to manufacturing have had such an unfortunate and adverse effect in my electorate. It needs to ensure that public sector services remain healthy and that regions get support. Those are the things that it needs to do in order to provide real long-term, lasting jobs in this community, jobs which will be of genuine benefit to all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party will not be opposing this legislation, but we will be moving a raft of amendments designed to improve it. They are designed to make it a fair dinkum labour market program which will be of benefit to unemployed people and to restore it from the shabby state in which it was introduced to this House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;After 15 months, Australians have begun asking: what has their Prime Minister (Mr Howard) been doing? What does he stand for? After seeing this budget, they have a right to ask: where are we going? What has all the pain been for?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And the sorry list goes on. Last year we had the perverted morality of core promises and non&hyphen;core promises. Behind this cloak, the Howard government dodged and weaved its way through its election promises, picking and choosing as it went. `Be relaxed and comfortable,' we were told. `Trust me,' he said. How can Australians trust the Prime Minister or feel secure or confident about their future if they cannot be confident about their present circumstances?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this country has is a poll&hyphen;driven Prime Minister. A Prime Minister who will not make a move until the polls tell him to move, and tell him which way to move. We cannot afford a Prime Minister like that. Australians were promised certainty, security and, most importantly, leadership. The government has not delivered on any of these. Rather, they have delivered uncertainty, insecurity and indecisiveness, and across the country a mood of quiet anger and frustration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Howard struggled so hard and so long to be Prime Minister. Now he occupies that office, he is like a rabbit caught in a spotlight&mdash;stunned and uncertain which way to turn. This budget just confirms the narrowness of his vision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A budget should, at the very least, be good economics. Labor has always agreed that Australia will benefit from bringing the federal budget into balance. But it has questioned the methods of achieving that goal and that timetable. We have argued that it should be achieved without destroying valuable public programs, without slowing the economy, without destroying services in rural and regional Australia and without budget tricks.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3826">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The budget relies on stealing $3.7 billion from workers' superannuation plans in four years. These super co&hyphen;contributions, which were promised and which were funded in last year's budget, have now been struck out and the stolen $3.7 billion used to prop up the bottom line. It relies on an optimistic unemployment forecast so that the bottom line looks better. Worst of all, this budget rips off low income and middle income workers to fund the coalition's extravagances and indulgences. How else can you describe the federation slush fund?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People should realise that this slush fund is being paid for by their stolen $3.7 billion superannuation co&hyphen;contributions and by increased charges they will be paying at the chemist and for child care. No money for old people's proper medicine, but a billion dollars for obelisks, fireworks and centennial champagne.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget is about the welfare of the Liberal Party and not the welfare of ordinary Australians. On this criterion, the second Howard budget confirms the government's dismal first year record on the key issues of jobs and economic growth. As a result of its first budget last year, which saw the economy slow to a crawl, the government has now been forced to revise down its forecast for growth in the current year to 3&frac14; per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the world economy growing healthily, the strong foundations of the economy they inherited and the housing cycle recovering, this government can surely do better than the 3&frac34; per cent forecast for next year. Remember this: four per cent growth in each of Labor's last four years and not a four per cent in sight in this budget. Even the Reserve Bank Governor thinks that Australia can sustain four per cent growth without creating inflationary problems. Without another period of sustained growth around the four per cent mark like that achieved in Labor's last term in office we cannot reduce unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under Treasury's economic growth projections, the unemployment rate will still be above 7&half; per cent by the end of the century. That is with all the assumptions underpinning the government's policies&mdash;industrial relations and everything else behind it. When the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government talks about jobs growth and job security, the only solution it can offer is more changes to the industrial relations system. No wonder workers feel uncertain about their future. It is a dismal economic outlook from a government that has nothing to offer on jobs and growth. Jobs growth has stalled. The latest labour force figures for April show trend employment growth is dead flat&mdash;exactly 0.0 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the January mid&hyphen;year economic review the government revised up its forecast for unemployment from 8&frac14; per cent to 8&half; per cent, a change the Treasurer described at the time as being mainly due to `rounding'. What a great relief that must be to the 23,000 extra unemployed people! This means,`Oh, we're not unemployed, we're just rounded!'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So much for `rounding': the forecast unemployment rate for the June quarter of 1997 has now been increased again, to 8&frac34; per cent. Since the coalition has been in office, virtually no extra full&hyphen;time jobs have been created. The number of unemployed people has risen by 31,500. Long&hyphen;term unemployment is at its highest level for two years. Even if the stronger growth forecast for next year is achieved, unemployment will be higher than it should and could have been. Claims of better economic prospects next year do not change the fact that the government has caused the economy to grow too slowly and, as a result, thousands of Australians are needlessly unemployed. The government's dismal record in office does not generate confidence that it can deliver on the slightly stronger growth forecasts in this budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Jobs growth and job security are the No. 1 issues in this nation. Labor has said that over and over again. Nothing is as important to the economic and social future of our community as generating new jobs. In doing that, we can start to make an impact on our unacceptable levels of unemployment, and, at the same time, provide people currently in work with some sense of security about their employment futures. But the Howard government has been fudging on the jobs issue since it was elected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the election, Mr Howard told us he had a plan to reduce unemployment. Where is that
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3827"> plan? Did it ever exist? Then at the start of this year, the government told us to judge their employment record after they had been in office for 12 months. Well, the 12 months are up; 15 months are up. We can now judge the performance of a government which is not even game enough to set itself a jobs target, and bothers to mention unemployment only once in its budget speech. When you look at the government's performance, you can understand why.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16">In Labor's last year in office total employment grew 176,000;</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="DOT" TYPE="NORMAL"> In your first year in office, it rose by 44,000.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is the record on which this government wanted to be judged. I leave it to all Australians to make their own judgments about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government says that it is confident that the unemployment rate will fall to eight per cent, but can we be confident? Last year the government loudly forecast the unemployment rate would fall to 8.25 per cent, but it is stuck at 8.7 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are 31,500 more unemployed Australians now than there were when the coalition came to office. The reason? The government in last year's budget axed government jobs, abolished jobs programs, cut skills training, slashed industry programs and deserted regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what does it do in this year's budget in response to the rise in unemployment? More of the same. There are nearly 90,000 young unemployed Australians and there are more than 700,000 older unemployed Australians. We all know that thousands of workers in
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> their 40s and 50s will lose their jobs in Newcastle, while this government sits idly by. The numbers of unemployed will continue to mount up during the next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let's be clear about this. As the federal government retreats towards Sydney and Melbourne, most of the job losses are going to be in regional towns. While the National Party is lost in action, the federal government is pulling the rug out from centres like Cairns, Townsville, Orange, Ballarat, Bendigo and Whyalla. As the Howard government closes its CES, Social Security, Medicare and tax offices, 16,500 more public service jobs will be lost mainly in rural and regional Australia. This follows the 12,600 already gone. And you can add some 4,000 private sector jobs that will go as these offices close. In addition, more than 20,000 jobs are to be lost from Telstra and the government's Defence Efficiency Review will mean the loss of a further 8,000 defence jobs, many in regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what is the government doing about jobs? Virtually nothing. The government has admitted that its work for the dole scheme will do nothing whatsoever to reduce Australia's high and rising youth unemployment rate. I don't think there are many Australians who have yet come to the knowledge of the fact that there are only 10,000 people picked up in this so&hyphen;called work for the dole scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The announcement of the new federation slush fund will do nothing to `generate jobs' quickly. It does not even begin until July 1998. Meanwhile, vocational education and training funds have been cut for the second year running and, sadly, even the number of apprenticeships fell in 1996&hyphen;97, as did the growth rate of traineeships. That is what happens when a Prime Minister and his government just do not care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday at the Press Club the Treasurer nominated national saving as the government's most important economic objective. But the government's decision to scrap the superannuation co&hyphen;contributions policy is a huge blow to national saving. Let's remind ourselves where the $3.7 billion stolen from workers' super plans was going. It was
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3828"> going&mdash;all of it, plus as much again in individual workers' contributions&mdash;straight onto the bottom line of private saving.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That $3.7 billion has now been pinched to pay for a re-election slush fund. And there's a savings plan that only the most well&hyphen;off can really benefit from. The effect on national saving can only be negative. It frightens us to see just how negative. The three plus three per cent co-contribution scheme alone would have contributed an extra $400 billion to the national savings pool over the next 20 years. And the coalition has just knocked it off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let's not be fooled about what is happening when the coalition puts the torch to national savings: they are redistributing national savings as income, and they are redistributing that income. Workers now in their mid&hyphen;30s, on average weekly earnings, will each lose around $110,000 from the lump sum they would have received on retirement under Labor's plan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But where does this money go? I'll tell you where the maximum benefit doesn't go:</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It doesn't go to the three million taxpayers who have no interest income to declare.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It doesn't go to 42 per cent of taxpayers on below average weekly earnings who don't receive any interest.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So where does it go?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Well, it definitely goes to the 463 people declaring incomes over $1 million a year, who earn on average $52,000 a year in interest.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It goes in multiples to members of wealthy families who split their savings income using trusts or other arrangements;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It goes to big shareholders like the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me give you a symbol of how this budget divides Australian society. On the day BHP announced the closure of the Newcastle steelworks, the price of BHP shares went up
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 50c. If you were a senior BHP manager with share options worth $110,000, your decision to close the steelworks would have made you a $3,000 capital gain overnight. And, under the scheme announced in this budget, that $3,000 would also have entitled you to the full $450 savings rebate. But, if you were a steelworker, you lost your job. Soon you will start to spend your savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The vandalising of health care continues in this budget.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On health and on other social services, the government's intentions over the past two budgets have been absolutely clear. As far as it can, it has walked away from its fundamental responsibility to provide a safety net of service to Australian families&mdash;families that have the right to expect their governments to help see them through times of stress and vulnerability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not what the Prime Minister promised in his third so&hyphen;called headland speech to ACOSS in October 1995. In that speech he gave eight `ironclad guarantees'. Guarantee No. 8 was that `there is no secret plan to slash $10 billion from social welfare'. Well, at last count, on Tuesday night, he only had a few hundred thousand dollars to go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Honourable members will also remember his promise to preserve Medicare. He has hung on to the name, and some of its main features, but he has also quietly but effectively undermined it in the meantime. Doctors' payments for home visits have been reduced. Eventually it will be impossible to get a doctor to call at your home, no matter how sick you are. There is nothing in the budget for a public hospital system starved by the cumulative effects of funding cuts from Commonwealth and state governments. Hospital waiting lists get longer and facilities continue to deteriorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having taken $500 million out of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme in the last budget, the government has cut it by another $700 million this time. This is the budget measure with the cute title of the<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> </EMPHASIS>`Therapeutic Group Premiums'. This actually is the `New Drugs Tax'. And it means that Australians will pay more for the latest, safest and best medication for such conditions as high blood pressure, depression, cholesterol and ulcers.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3829">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the new drugs tax, the government will only provide a full subsidy for the cheapest drug in each of six groups of drugs. If patients require one of the more expensive drugs, they will have to pay the difference. So choose your illness carefully, with an eye to market values. For, if your doctor prescribes a new drug which has fewer side effects and is more effective, you will pay up to $20 a script more. And none of the new drugs will count towards the safety net threshold.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This new drugs tax will establish a two&hyphen;tiered health system: one tier for the rich, who can afford the newest, safest most effective drugs; and the other for battling Australians, who will have to make do with the cheaper, less effective and less safe drugs. It means that pensioners and families who are doing it tough will be forced to choose between what they need and what they can afford.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There's more. A number of medications will be removed from the PBS scheme altogether. They include treatments for stomach problems, diarrhoea, muscle pain and anti&hyphen;fungal medicines. Pensioners and other concession card holders now pay $3.20 for these drugs. From next year, they will pay up to $9. We had the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) in this place today screw up his face in contempt and arrogance and say, `Besides, you can't stop me doing this; I do need to put it through the Senate.' In the usual sneaky way of this government, neither this nor the new drugs tax will count towards the safety net threshold.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the last two years, the government has found ways to strip between $300 million and $400 million out of schooling, more than $250 million out of vocational education, nearly $900 million out of the university system and nearly $2 billion out of labour market programs, many of them provided through TAFE colleges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has gone to enormous lengths to wheedle dollars and cents out of working families by forcing increases in HECS charges, by forcing students to start repaying HECS debts before they're earning a halfway decent wage, and by squeezing the Austudy and Abstudy schemes until they scream.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nearly a third of all the cuts in the last two budgets have been at the expense of help for families on low incomes. Let me give instances of the injury done to women and older family members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Child care is enormously significant for women, for example. It can decide whether a woman can go out to work or not. It decides whether she is free of anxiety. Access to good quality health care is uppermost in the minds of the average female member of an Australian household. Yet this government has ripped more than $820 million out of child care in less than a year. Despite the fact that women have supported them so royally over the years, their reward is $820 million out of child care in less than a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Older people, having worked and paid taxes all their lives, are another group which has been savagely treated by this government. It cut $500 million from aged care services in its first budget alone. It followed this up with one of the most cynical and callous laws ever seen in this parliament: the one that means that older people needing nursing home care&mdash;at their most vulnerable&mdash;would have to sell their homes to get that care. So much for a caring government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Politics might be becoming an increasingly technical discipline nowadays and increasingly difficult for the majority of voters to identify with. So this government can fiddle with means testing, indexation, cut&hyphen;offs and the like in the hope that their real agenda can be obscured behind technicalities&mdash;and they might even succeed from time to time. But I will tell you where they stand naked before the Australian people, where all the fudges and the statistics can't protect them: it's when people lose jobs. It's when the BHP board comes out and says that 2,700 workers are going to lose their jobs in Newcastle when the plant closes down. Then you have exposed&mdash;if they are a government that rely on simplistic economics textbooks&mdash;their failure to deliver jobs and job security.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Australians discover that their elected government is always the one turning up at the funeral of a steel plant with a bunch of wilted flowers, rather than having the plan to save it before it dies, then they have a right
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3830"> to be angry. They have a right to demand a better alternative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Well, they do have an alternative. And if they cast their minds back they might remember how that alternative dealt with exactly the same problem when we inherited it in 1983, along with a $25 billion budget deficit which we put into surplus. In response to BHP's intention to pull out of steel making in Newcastle, the Labor government implemented a steel plan: a plan which everyone supported, including the Prime Minister, who said he agreed it saved the steel industry in this country and that he would&mdash;and I quote&mdash;`not be stingy about giving credit to Senator Button for what he was able to do in relation to that'. Do you remember that? That was a government that did things. It was even praised by your Prime Minister, who has monumentally failed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fourteen years later, the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) is out to a long lunch when BHP announces its intention to pull out of steel making in Newcastle. When a crisis meeting of Newcastle steelworkers was held, the minister was donning his black tie for a cocktail party at the Crown Casino opening in Melbourne. Not my shadow minister, who received the same invitation; he was there in Newcastle listening to people's concerns.</PARA>

Let us just see if they decide to do something or just order the white carnations for another funeral.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In two budgets now, the coalition has steadily surrendered or reduced activities that have been accepted for generations&mdash;and by Australians of all political colour&mdash;as core
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> responsibilities of service to the community.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the passage of the International Tax Agreements Amendment Bill (No.1) 1997. This bill will provide for the insertion into the Income Tax (International Agreements) Act of 1953 the text of the notes exchanged between Australia and Vietnam, amending the comprehensive double taxation agreement between the two countries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These notes were exchanged with Vietnam on 22 November 1996 and give effect to Australia's undertaking in 1992 regarding double taxation. In 1992, the double taxation agreement with Vietnam was signed with the purpose of Australia granting tax sparing for special Vietnamese tax concessions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tax sparing is a situation whereby Vietnam offers tax concessions to attract foreign investment. Under these tax sparing credit arrangements, an Australian investor who takes up an offer of specialised tax concession is deemed to have paid the tax actually forgone by Vietnam for the purposes of Australian foreign tax credit rules. These arrangements are necessary in that, without tax sparing credits, the concessions granted to Australians by Vietnam could be negated by Australia's foreign tax credit rules.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Three conditions must be met to qualify for tax sparing concessions under the terms of these notes. Firstly, the activity undertaken must meet the conditions of a specified Vietnamese law contained in the notes. Secondly, the incentive must be for a specified activity listed in the notes which will result in genuine economic development and active business income. The third condition allows for the exclusion of certain activities and tax sparing incentives. These include the banking and the finance sector, and some shipping and aircraft operations. Also included in this condition is a general anti&hyphen;avoidance provision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the time of the negotiations on the parameters of the credit notes there were a variety of tax rates applicable to foreign investors in Vietnam. These ranged from 25 per cent down to 10 per cent. It was therefore important to establish a benchmark for the underlying rate in order to calculate the amount of tax forgone by Vietnam. It was agreed that this benchmark rate would be 20 per cent.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3833">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As is the custom in Australia with tax sparing arrangements, the benefits are provided to Australian residents for a period of 10 years. There is provision for the extension of this period, which began on 1 July 1993, on the grounds of a future agreement. The notes will enter into force when the future exchanging of diplomatic notes advising of the necessary constitutional processes has been fulfilled. A final binding treaty, and the enactment of this legislation, will complete the processes required by Australia for these purposes. This exchange of notes is an important step in the recognition by Australia of the importance of Vietnam to our region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last few years Vietnam has started taking great strides in its economic development. On 28 July 1995 Vietnam became a full member of ASEAN. Only two weeks earlier, the USA announced its normalisation of diplomatic relations between the two countries. These were two significant events in the opening of Vietnam to international trade and growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Basic elements of commercial operations are currently in place and rapidly expanding. There are an abundant number of business opportunities emerging but there is currently not enough local capital to develop these possibilities. During the 1990s, Australia has experienced a tenfold increase in bilateral trade with Vietnam and we are currently one of the top 10 foreign investors in Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As part of the coalition government's commitment to assisting trade in our region, the minister, Mr Fischer, established the Market Development Task Force in 1996. The role of the task force is to better coordinate government activity within the trade portfolio. The task force is involved in setting realistic and achievable priorities in bilateral market access, trade promotion and trade development. The task force is about achieving outcomes and has recently given close examination to the emerging markets in our region, including an examination of the possibilities arising from increased growth in Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The relationship between Australia and Vietnam is one of increasing strength and cooperation. As part of Tuesday's federal budget, the government announced that country program assistance to Vietnam will be maintained. This means a coalition commitment of $66 million in aid to Vietnam over 1997&hyphen;98. Projects in Vietnam that will be funded include malaria prevention, providing a reliable supply of clean water, general sanitation projects, and the construction of the My Thuan bridge. The My Thuan bridge will open up the Mekong delta to increased economic development and is one of Vietnam's highest infrastructure priorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is an important part of our increasing trade relationship. It is a signal to the Vietnamese that we are taking our maturing trade relationship seriously. As trade between our two countries increases, it is important that the government can come to a fair agreement on tax sparing that matches the changing nature of the trade relationship. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The International Tax Agreements Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1997 sets out to enhance Australian business opportunities in Vietnam by providing a more agreeable tax environment. It serves to formalise Australia's undertaking, given in 1992, to grant tax sparing arrangements for specific Vietnamese tax concessions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Double tax agreements are generally supported in principle by Australian tax experts and are acknowledged to be an integral part of our economic internationalisation. However, a submission made to the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties in March of this year on behalf of the Institute of Chartered Accountants, the ICA, reveals a number of concerns with this particular agreement. The ICA is concerned not only with the limited application of the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3834"> legislation to Australian exporters but also with the lack of consultation with industry in the treaty making process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Braddon (Mr Miles), in his second reading speech on behalf of the government rightly points out that tax sparing is utilised by the Vietnamese government to encourage international investment in Vietnam. He also suggested that without tax sparing credits:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Vietnamese tax concessions granted to Australian residents could be negated by Australia's foreign tax credit rules which would effectively top up Vietnamese taxes paid to the level of tax that would be payable on an equivalent amount of Australian domestic income.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He paints a very rosy picture of the benefits of tax sparing for Australian investors in Vietnam. Those Australian companies which qualify for the exemption will no longer be forced to pay the difference between Vietnam's tax rate and Australia's. This is both reasonable and sensible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Institute of Chartered Accountants makes it clear that whilst tax sparing does not represent a cost to Australian revenue:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many of the features of the tax sparing agreement are those insisted upon by the Vietnamese government. These include the cap on the tax sparing rate, the exclusion of accounting and auditing services from tax sparing relief, and the defined permitted activities.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ICA acknowledges at the same time that these conditions are consistent with Vietnamese domestic taxation law. However, it is obvious that only a limited pool of Australian investors in Vietnam will benefit from this agreement. Services&mdash;including accounting, consulting, banking, commercial and insurance&mdash;will not be able to utilise the tax sparing agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Treasurer (Mr Costello) has also conceded that aircraft and shipping operations will only benefit in part from this tax relief. Many tax experts believe this to be inappropriate. The Institute of Chartered Accountants maintains that other prospective tax sparing agreements should not be restricted to reflect the domestic law of the country in which the tax sparing income is sourced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It agrees that some Australian enterprises could be encouraged to export to foreign markets by tax sparing negotiations, but it stipulates that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Until the source country extends its domestic law to allow a tax concession, no practical issue will arise.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The ICA agreed that it is necessary to maintain the integrity of tax sparing arrangements with Vietnam, but it went on to note:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In material terms, the Vietnamese domestic law will limit tax sparing available to Australian taxpayers, and this would make the conclusion of the double tax agreement expedient in its present form.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">To date, our trade with Vietnam has been quite limited. Australia's 1995&hyphen;96 trade table showed Vietnam as 32nd among our top 45 trading partners. Total two&hyphen;way trade between Australia and Vietnam in that year amounted to around $527 million, which represented a 0.3 per cent share of our total trade figures. Significantly though, our total export dollars were almost half that of our total import expenditure. In fact, our net exports are calculated at minus $131 million for the year 1995&hyphen;96.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This figure represents a substantial reversal in the flow of trade from 1989 to 1990, when Australian exports exceeded Vietnamese imports by some $66 million. We certainly have some ground to make up if we are to establish balanced two&hyphen;way trade with our Vietnamese partner. Now is the time to do it.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3835">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">David Lague, a journalist with the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, observed on 3 March 1997 that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Vietnam's economic reforms and the possibility of funding from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, mean trade could grow rapidly over the rest of the decade.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Lague notes that, as Vietnam overcomes longstanding regional antagonisms and re&hyphen;establishes economic relations, both within and outside the Asian domain, investment opportunities in Vietnam will boom.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The formalisation of this double tax agreement and the recent appointment of Australia's first trade commissioner to Hanoi are a recognition of the opportunities evolving in Vietnam. Australia currently ranks as the third biggest foreign investor in Vietnam, trailing only Taiwan and Hong Kong. A number of analysts predict that the United States will soon reassess its trade embargo on Vietnam and that it is essential that Australia consolidates its investment and trade relationships with Hanoi before that occurs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As indicated earlier, the ICA's submission to the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties expressed concern over the inadequate consultation in the formulation of this double tax agreement. It correctly asserts that the Australian Taxation Office should seek early and extensive deliberations with all relevant professional parties. The ICA submission goes on to read in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Future tax related international agreements should be subject to the full consultative progress, as occurs and operates well in some other aspects of taxation law and policy.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The clear inference there is that proper and meaningful consultation with industry did not occur in this case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill formalises an undertaking made five years ago between the Australian and Vietnamese governments. There is no excuse for the circumstances described, or for the former government not to have canvassed industry feedback on the nature of the agreement in that period. Given the coalition's election commitment to reforming the treaty making process, there is no justification whatsoever for this tardy management of legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his speech on 2 May 1996, the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) promised the Australian community a more consultative and accountable treaty making process. Amongst other things he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Every Australian individual and interest group with a concern about treaty issues has the opportunity to make that concern known.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consultation will be the key word, and the government will not act to ratify a treaty unless it is able to assure itself that the treaty action proposed is supported by national interest considerations.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Clearly, the Institute of Chartered Accountants is not satisfied with either the timing or the extent of consultation on this particular tax agreement. They argue that they have not seen the Minister for Foreign Affairs' `democratic deficit' in our treaty making process applied in this instance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ICA submission suggests that organisations with expertise in the field of international tax law should be consulted once the initial round of diplomatic negotiations has been conducted. I am interested to hear the coalition's response to this recommendation, given its pledge to its Australian electors at the last election to be more inclusive than its predecessor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Treaties noted that the consultation with industry was unsatisfactory in the lead&hyphen;up to making the double tax agreement with Vietnam.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3836"> The member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss), who sits on the treaties committee, noted that there had seemingly been no discussion with the professional bodies in Australia in regard to this international tax agreement. He observed:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This was a very complex issue, and it was only when the committee drew attention to the fact that there had been this lack of consultation that there was able to be a resolution of some of the issues of concern. The consultation should not be left to the time when the Treaties Committee makes these reviews.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I repeat what he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The consultation should not be left to the time when the Treaties Committee makes these reviews.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The chairman of the committee, the member for Groom (Mr Taylor), said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We were concerned that the consultation between the ATO and professional accounting bodies and the quality of the national interest analysis that accompanied the agreement was less than satisfactory.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">According to the chairman, the national interest analysis&mdash;the NIA&mdash;was not only unnecessarily difficult to understand but it actually omitted important information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The whole point of introducing NIAs was to facilitate parliamentary scrutiny of treaties. In the words of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, they are designed to `note the reasons why Australia should become a party to a treaty.' The exclusion of important information from any NIA, whether the exclusion is intentional or not, has the potential to render the whole process a farce.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ICA is not only concerned about the timing of the dialogue between industry and the government, it is equally concerned with the content of this dialogue. It suggests that for Australia's treaty making process to be fully transparent, consultation with industry should cover all aspects of the proposed tax agreement. The ICA's report said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no justification for the consultation to be confined to those areas of a treaty which the ATO or Treasury decide are significant.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the ATO has reservations due to the confidential nature of the international negotiations, it is submitted that they are unfounded. Members of the profession have expressed their willingness to sign the same secrecy provisions which bind members of the ATO in order to promote consultation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Neither the ATO nor the Treasury should wield discretionary power in this matter. The Institute of Chartered Accountants is right to assert that all aspects of this and future international tax agreements should be the subject of objective and consistent checks and balances. The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) is recorded in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  as having said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I firmly believe that the impact of international laws in the domestic context makes it imperative that we continue to improve (that) transparency and recognise the fundamental right of people to scrutinise the way international law is made.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Amen to that. That was what the minister had to say 12 months ago; yet here we are today, debating only the second international tax agreement since he made that remark, and we have both the Institute of Chartered Accountants and the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties questioning the treaty making process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill does provide incentives for certain Australian businesses to develop the Vietnamese market&mdash;to what extent, though, is anyone's guess. The fact that the financial impact statement provided with the proposed legislation can at best only estimate an annual cost to revenue of somewhere between $10 million and $15 million indicates that no&hyphen;one is really sure what impact this agreement will have on Australia. Specifically, Australian businesses investing in infrastructure in Vietnam should benefit from this tax exemption. It is on this ground that I support the bill.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3837">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, this agreement has demonstrated big holes in the coalition's supposedly impervious treaty making process. Perhaps the Foreign Minister's new code of conduct is working well in the area of Foreign Affairs, but it is obviously not effective in the domain of the Treasury or the Australian Taxation Office. The Institute of Chartered Accountants and the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties have described substandard practices in both the timing and nature of consultation within industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Industry groups have called on the Australian Taxation Office to commit to a review procedure. A review of the ATO's method of consultation is, of course, of particular importance, given that the coalition government has indicated that it will negotiate as many double tax agreements as it can in the future, and I stress `as many as it can'. If double tax agreements are a necessary part of economic globalisation&mdash;and clearly they are&mdash;they need to be negotiated to maximise the benefits to Australia. That will necessitate a truly open and accountable process of consultation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that the ATO expects to present a proposal to the Treasurer later this week, seeking authority to consult more widely on international tax agreements. One option that the ATO is exploring is the publication of details of pending double tax agreements in the national printed media. That would certainly be a step in the right direction. However, it would not bring about a reform of the subjective manner in which the ATO arrives at the details of future tax treaties, if the present example is to be relied upon. Further, this proposal will not guarantee more time for discussion by experts and interested persons unless the ATO publishes, or makes available, details early on in the negotiation stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I indicated earlier, Australia's dealings with Vietnam are limited relative to our trade with other nations. But what the International Tax Agreements Amendment Bill (No.1) 1997 serves to highlight is the critical need for a truly open and meaningful consultation process in this country. It is equally obvious that such a process is not operational at present.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the maintenance of checks and balances like those outlined by the Institute of Chartered Accountants that contributes towards a workable and sustainable democracy in Australia. Those proposals deserve serious consideration by the government. I repeat that I support the measure.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Although the bill before us, the International Tax Agreements Amendment Bill (No.1) 1997, is not controversial in the sense that it is not being opposed, it is an important bill. I must commend the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) for his excellent presentation of the issues involved in this bill and some of the problems related to it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true to say that in a sense this bill is symbolic because it is dealing with one area. But the ramifications of the bill are huge in the sense that we also have agreements similar to this with Malaysia, Singapore, Sri Lanka, China, Kiribati and Korea, and we are looking to other agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this context, it is very important that we get the nature of these agreements correct and also that we learn some things about how we can benefit Australia in this process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Essentially this proposal is concerned with the notion of tax sparing, which has to do with allowing Australian companies to gain a tax concession on the basis that they have been given a tax concession by the government of Vietnam. The government of Vietnam, like many Asian countries, gives tax concessions for investment in various industries and also concessions when profits are made.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3838">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this situation it is important that you do not get a negation of that effect by the company then having to pay tax in Australia and being put in an awkward position. This bill is intended to extend this notion of tax sparing in relation to Vietnam so that we have a situation where companies can claim the same concession basically being transferred into Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting that this phenomenon is occurring and I read out before the other countries with which we have these arrangements&mdash;they are all Asian countries. What is important here is that it is in Asia that we see this massive effort&mdash;not just in Asia but primarily in Asia, especially in Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore and China&mdash;to give big concessions to industry for investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note this point in the context of Tuesday's federal budget. What was interesting in the federal budget was the complete absence of any incentives at all for Australian industry. You could not get a bigger contrast when you think about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are supposed to think of ourselves as part of the Asian region and associate ourselves with the Asian region. Virtually every country in Asia gives significant and major concessions for industry development, especially manufacturing industries, and we do not. We don't do anything. There is absolutely no reason why anybody should invest in Australia when facing the kinds of concessions given to companies to invest, especially in manufacturing and production, in other parts of the world but especially in the Asian region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Vietnam has opened up its economy and more and more foreign investment is going into Vietnam. I read recently that Vietnam is trying to copy what has been going on in China under the policies of Deng Xiaoping. I have just come back from a visit with a parliamentary delegation to China. You would not believe the development and the production that is going on there. It is very hard to believe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This kind of development is also starting to happen in Vietnam. In China, they build whole cities like Shenzhen&mdash;with 3&half; million people in 15 years&mdash;and huge skyscrapers, railway systems, roads, bridges, five&hyphen;star hotels and factories, one after the other. There is production, manufacturing and development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Compared to all that dynamism, the Australian economy is a disgrace. Yet we are saying, `Let's try and get Australians involved in this process.' That is why I support this bill to get Australians involved in Vietnam and, by extension, in the other countries where we have double taxation arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we have learnt nothing ourselves from all of the developments in the Asian region. We do not give these sorts of concessions; we do not even think about it. We are obsessed with only one thing and that is whether or not there is a surplus in the budget. We have no idea about spending a dollar so as to make two or three in the future, especially in infrastructure development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very interesting that investments in infrastructure in Vietnam will be covered in these proposals, yet we ask ourselves, `What is happening with investment in infrastructure in Australia?' We have an infrastructure investment situation, but it is measly compared to what is required for this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we think about budgeting, the analogy is often used about the household. The Treasurer (Mr Costello) said you cannot spend what you do not have. If you took that idea totally literally, nobody would ever buy a house on a mortgage because they certainly do not have the money. They have to borrow the money.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3839">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Borrowing for investment in growth, infrastructure and development of industry is an investment in the future. Such borrowing is going to come back in a positive way, just as when you invest in a house and you go to the bank and you borrow money, it comes back positively. That simple fundamental economic lesson seems to be one which is totally missed here because this government is totally obsessed with an ideology that is out of date; it has been rejected around the world. What are even conservative governments around the world doing? Most conservative governments are actually borrowing. They are investing, they are growing their economies, they are pushing them along&mdash;with the exception of the Australian government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to Vietnam and the other double taxation arrangements, as the member for Curtin mentioned, even this particular proposal is not sufficiently wide and open. A number of possibilities have been closed because this agreement was achieved without sufficient consultation with interested parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That shows the total ignorance our public servants have about what is happening in Asia. Basically, they are hopeless. The advice they have given to the government about what is happening in Asia&mdash;how the various countries of Asia are developing their economies, how they want Australian investment and Australian dual projects, how they want Australia to get into China, Vietnam and all those other countries&mdash;shows that our bureaucrats, our public servants, do not have a clue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me give an example. What would happen to a businessman in Vietnam or China who applied for a visitors visa to come to Australia to have a look around and see what business he could do? He would probably be rejected. A number of businessmen in China and Vietnam and so on have been put off by the fact that they cannot come here because they cannot get a visa for a month or two to have a look around. They are given a grilling. This is our idea of how to do business with Asia.</PARA>

This is one example of what is going on. The reality is that unless we improve our approach, our knowledge, our understanding of what is going on in Asia, that unless we actually decide that we are going to get together with the communities in Asia in terms of dynamic economic development, then we are going to be left behind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do not think that there are not alternatives to Australia for these people. There are alternatives. Other countries are already looking at taking a section of our trade, even primary commodities. If you think the business we already have is guaranteed, you should see the competition occurring amongst companies from all over the world that are trying to get into Vietnam, China and other Asian countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia was not admitted into the discussions between the European Community and the various countries of ASEAN. We were not admitted into the discussions between China and the European nations. The danger is that these arrangements will occur amongst Europe, the United States and the Asian nations and we will be left in some kind of backwater.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we make agreements of this kind, we should have people go there, look at what is required, and do whatever we can to promote business, interconnections, trade and investment between Vietnam and Australia and, indeed, between China and Australia, as well as Malaysia,
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3840"> Singapore and the other countries of Asia. If we do not do that, we will be in a very serious situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This general arrangement of international tax agreements was initiated by the Labor government. It was, as I mentioned, one of several such agreements which the Labor government initiated. The previous Prime Minister had a commitment to improving links with Asia. He understood the importance of links, especially economic links, with Asia so that we could become part of the action in that dynamic region of the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Naturally, the Australian Labor Party was involved in developing these agreements and it supports the general thrust of the legislation although, I must say, I agree with the qualifications and the problems outlined by the member for Curtin. The legislation could have been more extensive. It could have allowed for greater investment and, most importantly, it could have been based on consultation between the people affected, in both Vietnam and the Australian companies and individuals interested in doing business with Vietnam.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3841">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that the International Tax Agreements Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1997 is a very important bill. It will give the force of law in Australia to the exchange of notes that took place on 22 November 1996 amending the Australia&hyphen;Vietnam double taxation agreement. The exchange of notes was announced by our Treasurer (Mr Costello) on 22 November 1996. The notes implement, effectively, the tax sparing provisions of the double tax agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A benchmark rate of 20 per cent has been set for the Vietnamese tax otherwise payable. If the prevailing Vietnamese tax rate drops below 20 per cent that lower rate will become the benchmark. When the notes were negotiated, a variety of nominal tax rates were applicable to foreign investors in Vietnam, ranging from 25 per cent down to 10 per cent. Under the notes, the tax sparing is for the 10 years commencing from the date of effect of the Vietnamese double taxation arrangement, which is 1 July 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government firmly believes that this exchange of notes will contribute positively to the strengthening of trade and investment and to a wider relationship between Australia and Vietnam. That is particularly important, given the importance of its geographic location in the Asian area, but also because of the need to continue to strengthen our relationship with Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the new arrangements introduced by this government to promote greater community awareness and discussion of treaty obligations, these notes and a national interest analysis were tabled in the House on 11 February 1997. The notes have already been reviewed by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the first tax treaty to be reviewed by the committee. It held two hearings on this treaty and took submissions from the Australian Taxation Office, the Institute of Chartered Accountants and the Australian Society for Certified Practising Accountants. It was during that process that a number of important issues concerning these notes were clarified. The committee reported on this treaty in March of this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tabling of the committee hearings has permitted significant public debate and clarification of these notes already. The committee recommended that the exclusion of accounting and auditing services from the tax sparing would be kept under review and if Vietnamese legislation is amended, negotiations commenced to provide tax sparing. Importantly, the committee did not recommend changes to the notes and supported the early ratification.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important that we consider the fact that this is the very first bill that has been considered under the new arrangements that this government put in place in relation to international treaties. Under the previous administration you would not have had this process of consultation. Therefore, it is an important step forward and a very positive one. I think that coming out of it, it is important to make sure that we do proceed constructively in relation to the way that we deal with foreign treaties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) raised the issue of consultation. Can I say that the government will be positively looking at improving consultation as part of the treaty process. The government will be responding also to the recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. Not only is this bill important from the point of view of international treaties, it is also important from the point of view of our relationships with other countries, and in this case Vietnam.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I propose to speak only briefly in relation to this bill. The Crimes Amendment (Forensic Procedures) Bill 1997 represents the fulfilment of yet another commitment made by the previous Labor government. In the Justice Statement launched in May 1995, the previous Labor government committed itself to the introduction of:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a forensic procedures bill to allow police to apply for court orders to take samples from suspected criminals for identification.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As the Justice Statement went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The use of forensic samples is a very important tool in crime investigation. The compulsory taking of samples is necessary for effective law enforcement. The lack of such powers might advantage criminals. The Commonwealth legislation will build in substantial civil liberty safeguards.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Later in 1995, the Crimes Amendment (Forensic Procedures) Bill 1995 was introduced and passed through the House. That bill was based on the Model Forensic Procedures Bill developed by the Model Criminal Code Officers' Committee of the Standing Committee of Attorneys&hyphen;General. In turn, the model bill drew on the recommendations of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report on Body Samples and Examinations</EMPHASIS>  published by the Victorian Consultative Committee on Police Powers of Investigation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1995 bill found its way to the Senate and, following consideration by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee which reported in October 1995, the bill lapsed when the parliament was prorogued for the 1996 federal election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill currently before the House relies heavily on the 1995 bill, although amendments have been made adopting most of the 20 unanimous recommendations of the Senate committee. Only three of those recommendations have not been adopted in full. Recommendations 1 and 3 sought to limit the power to take body samples and conduct examinations, particularly of breast swabs in the case of recommendation 3, to circumstances in which the offence was punishable by imprisonment for five years or more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has applied this recommendation, save that it has reduced the scope of the exception to apply it to indictable offences only. It also appears, on the basis of further consideration, that the Senate committee, in agreeing to recommendation 3, failed to fully appreciate the nature of the procedures contemplated by the relevant provisions. Accordingly, the opposition believes that these amendments are appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recommendation 2 prevented the taking of dental impressions. This recommendation was based on the state of forensic dontology as it was in 1995. I am advised that technical developments made since that time mean that low&hyphen;invasive techniques for the taking of dental impressions are now available.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3843">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It follows that this bill remains, in essence, and largely in substance, Labor's 1995 bill. I note that this bill is also designed to serve as a model for state and territory forensic procedures bills. I hope that the various jurisdictions will give strong consideration to bringing their laws into line with those to be adopted in this bill. The consistency of Australian criminal law has long been overdue. As it is implemented, it will greatly enhance citizens' knowledge of and consistent treatment by the law. It will also enable our law enforcement authorities to spend less time worrying about which law they need to apply and more time catching and prosecuting criminals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The benefits of the bill, both in its longer term use as a model for the states and territories and in its immediate application to provide consistency of forensic procedures for the prosecution of Commonwealth offences, are obvious. What concerns me on a personal level is that I had some reservations in the previous parliament on aspects of this bill. I voiced those reservations within the caucus committee of the Australian Labor Party. A number of those reservations are still relevant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to be very careful as a parliament not to bring in legislation just to the lowest common denominator. If we are going to be invading people's liberties, then there has to be some protections. Whilst the opposition will be supporting this bill, I put on notice to the government that there are a number of submissions that I anticipate are still coming to the opposition as to how the bill could be improved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I put the government on notice that, between the passage of this bill in the House of Representatives and its final consideration in the Senate, the opposition is going to be consulting with a number of community groups and individuals who are working at the coalface to ensure that this bill has adequate protections and to see whether it can be further improved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not going to do that in a destructive manner. We hope to do it in a constructive fashion, because there have been some improvements in terms of forensic dontology and other aspects of forensic behaviour in that time. We also need to look at these things afresh. Some time has elapsed. We want to get the federal model right so that the states can pick it up, but we want to have the right balance. We want to be very careful that we do not put in some protections because they are too hard or because some states might not like them. I put that reservation on the table.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have not been able to give specifics because we have not had further submissions, but I have been personally contacted by people in this area who lobbied me last time. I think it is a matter that I should put on the record, that on the previous bill I was not totally happy with it. We hope to discuss these matters with the government in a constructive fashion. The Labor Party does not want to just take an oppositionist role. These things have important ramifications when they affect the powers of police. I am not one who subscribes to the view that what we do is legislate to the lowest common denominator and then you have a situation where some police could abuse these powers. And that is the situation&mdash;there has been a number of royal commissions conducted around this country that show that police have abused powers that have been given to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By and large, the opposition is supporting this bill. It is an improvement on the bill that we introduced in the last parliament because the government has picked up some of the recommendations of the Senate committee. We would just ask that the government look again at some of the reservations that were in the Senate committee's report that did not form
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3844"> recommendations. There were some reservations of committee members and we would ask the government to have a look at whether, with the passage of time, some of those reservations might now be further considered to be put into this bill. The opposition commends the bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am always very concerned about amendments to legislation which give police greater powers. I am always concerned that those sorts of amendments have to be carefully looked at. Having said that, I wish I had more time to carefully look at these amendments to the Crimes Amendments (Forensic Procedures) Bill. We must always remember what was said nearly 150 years ago by Vice&hyphen;Chancellor Knight&hyphen;Bruce, I think it was, in a case that I cannot remember the name of. In talking about the striving to get people convicted if they were guilty, he included a cautionary note in relation to the question of truth. He said, `It may be pursued too keenly. It may be loved unwisely. It may cost too much.' It is a principle that I think has to always be borne in mind in considering these sorts of matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is always a matter of getting the balance right between the community's interest in ensuring that people who commit serious criminal offences are convicted and punished, and the interest of the individual who may be caught up in that process and who has been dealt with harshly in being so caught up. There have been a number of very prominent examples of that this century where individuals have been caught up. As I think I have said before in the House, once the criminal process begins it is not very nice to be on the other end of it. It is a very all&hyphen;embracing process and people who get swept up into it really find it very difficult to get out until those magic words are pronounced by the jury.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have seen a number of cases where judges have virtually told juries to acquit because of the paucity of evidence and the way the investigative procedure has been conducted. With that in mind I also say that, on the other side of the coin, it is important for police to be armed in a modern age with all the powers that lead to the undertaking of forensic procedures so that they can carry out investigations in a thorough and proper way. The investigative arm conducted by the police is not frozen in time, and ought not to be frozen in time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are constant changes and developments in science and technology that must be kept pace with. In that regard I think it is also important, in the overall context of the community's interest in ensuring that guilty people do get found guilty and do get punished, to say that the end result must also be considered. I have, for example, great difficulty&mdash;I mention this since the Attorney&hyphen;General is here&mdash;with the fact that appeal courts can enter verdicts of acquittal where scientific evidence is being questioned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A very notorious case in relation to that is the case of the Queen and Raymond Carroll. Carroll was charged with the murder of Deidre Kennedy. It was a shocking crime that occurred in 1973 in Ipswich where a 17&hyphen;month&hyphen;old child was murdered. Carroll was charged quite a number of years after&mdash;I think almost 10 years after&mdash;with the offence. He was found guilty by a jury but the court of criminal appeal quashed the conviction and entered a verdict of acquittal. In that case, the question of a bite mark on the child's thigh was concerned and the admissibility or reliability of various evidence about that particular matter came into close focus. With the advances in technology that case may well be able to be re&hyphen;opened but for the fact that the court of criminal appeal has pronounced on it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not passing judgment on the Carroll case. What I am saying is that one must look at the overall need to ensure that guilty people are brought to justice and I question the powers
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3845"> that are given to appeal courts to enter verdicts of acquittal where scientific evidence is raised in sharp focus.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Other">Mr TONY SMITH &mdash;I am very concerned about the powers of the courts of appeal to enter verdicts of acquittal. I throw that into the melting pot merely to emphasis the fact that in a legislative package like this, we have to think of all of the ends that are sought to be achieved. It is no good having these sorts of procedures which are good, in general, if we do not also look at the powers of the courts of appeal. Generally speaking, I do not believe that a court of appeal ought to have the power to enter a verdict of acquittal, but there are always exceptions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Very briefly, in relation to the bill, they are model provisions drawing on the 1989 Coldrey report. It is basically the creation of a code for taking bodily samples for examination. It balances the interest of the public and the rights of the suspect, and there is a great emphasis in the particular legislation on the rights of the suspect. Non&hyphen;consensual examination can occur within strict guidelines. It does end the present reliance upon varying state jurisdictions for their particular legislation. For example, in Queensland it is section 259 of the criminal code. In passing, I would like to have, as a defence lawyer, this particular set of provisions in Queensland instead of section 259, which is a fairly rigid section in terms of the powers that are given to take samples. I do not need to go into it, but the rights of suspects in relation to section 259 of the code are very much circumscribed. But, of course, there is always the supervisory jurisdiction of the court at trial and the exercise of discretionary principles that might arise under Bunning v Cross, and other cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have mentioned before the fact that forensic science is not frozen; it is constantly evolving, and this has to be borne in mind. I have just a couple of concerns about the bill itself&mdash;I emphasis again, I have not read it all, unfortunately. I find a couple of inconsistencies in the bill and I think that these should be addressed. Generally, may I say at the outset, there is an awful tendency on the part of legislators, and even at courts of trial, for courts to patronise people of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander descent. At times, it can become nauseating at the bar table to hear prosecutors asking questions of Aboriginal people in a manner which I do not think is intentional, but gives the impression that they almost believe that the Aboriginal person does not have a brain at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mention that in order to point out something that perhaps should be addressed in the legislation. Clause 23WX, subclauses (1) to (4), and also clause 23XR&mdash;by way of looking at the trend in the legislation&mdash;cover procedure, of course. Clause 23WX in part reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> A suspect who is:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) a child; or</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) an incapable person;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">must be represented by an interview friend and may also be represented <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> by a legal practitioner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> If the applicant believes on reasonable grounds that the suspect is an Aboriginal person or a Torres Strait Islander not covered by subsection (2), the suspect must be represented by an interview friend&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Please note the mandatory provisions&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">and may also be represented by a legal practitioner.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3846">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Subsection (3) does not apply if the applicant believes on reasonable grounds that, having regard to the suspect's level of education and understanding, the suspect is not at a disadvantage in relation to the hearing by comparison with members of the Australian community generally.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I have no problem with that provision. But you cannot say that, because a person is an Aboriginal, they are somehow different in terms of knowledge and understanding. So there ought to be a discretion for the applicant to make that assessment: it is quite common in other legislation. Similarly, there is that trend in clause 23XR.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the time limits in the bill, in relation to people under some disability, are such that the examination for forensic procedures must be carried out within two hours, for a child or an incapable person not in custody. In relation to Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander persons, there is also a two hours mandatory provision. But, for a suspect not covered by either (1) or (2)&mdash;that is, not a child, an incapable person, an Aboriginal person or Torres Strait Islander person&mdash;the limit is four hours. I see that as inconsistent with the other clauses of the act. Really, there should be a discretion there&mdash;to follow the clauses that I have referred to&mdash;to permit a longer period if the applicant, the investigating police officer or some person involved in the investigation believes on reasonable grounds that, having regard to the suspect's level of education and understanding, the suspect is not at a disadvantage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me to follow; otherwise, you are drawing a distinction between one section of the community and another, and there are plenty of people of European descent who are at great disadvantage in the community, and plenty of people of ethnic and other origins who also are at great disadvantage, and they are not covered. Looking at the rest of the act, I believe there should be a provision that allows a degree of liberality, if you like, so that we are not focusing on one section of the community and patronising it by saying that, somehow or other, that section of the community requires a two&hyphen;hour limit because we accept that that section of the community is simply not generally capable of having the same level of understanding and judgment that another section of the community has.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, from many cases I have done in your neck of the woods up in the South Burnett, there are many people of Aboriginal descent who, in terms of their level of understanding and knowledge, would leave for dead some people of European descent whom I have acted for. On the other side of the coin, there are people of Aboriginal descent who do need great assistance in relation to interview procedures and procedures of this particular nature. It is a matter that really ought to be looked at, to give some sort of consistency to the overall thing. I put that point respectfully, Mr Attorney, and I am sorry for the notice. I did speak to one of the officers only this morning about this. It is something that I think should be looked at, overall.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another thing occurred to me: what about the position of transsexuals? I can imagine the case arising where a transsexual person is going to have to be examined. Where do we go, in terms of the act, with that person? That is going to happen. It is not so unusual to find oneself in that situation today, and yet that is really not covered in the bill. After all, we are trying to construct a piece of legislation which will lead to a more effective administration of the criminal justice system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have looked generally at other sections. As I say, it is a much more comprehensive piece of legislation, which I generally support&mdash;subject to those qualifications and subject to the fact that I have not considered the entirety of the bill. But, generally speaking, I support it as an instrument that balances fairly the needs of the community against the individual rights of the suspect who is being interviewed. Subject to those particular matters and the important matter
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3847"> of ensuring that the whole package in the criminal justice system is always looked at when one is introducing measures of this nature, I think, on the whole, it is a valuable piece of legislation in the Commonwealth Crimes Act and one that will, in my view, achieve a good deal of good by ensuring the administration of the criminal justice system.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) commenced his second reading speech by saying that the Crimes Amendment (Forensic Procedures) Bill is long overdue. It does, as previous speakers have indicated, arise from legislation that lapsed when the parliament was prorogued before the last election. As the member for Banks (Mr Melham) indicated, the opposition supports the legislation. On the basis of the bill including some of the proposals that have come out of the Senate committee process, it believes the legislation is in some respects a modest improvement on earlier legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation represents a very important step towards a higher level of commonality between the various criminal justice jurisdictions in Australia. In this area of the law, as the member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith) indicated, there is not yet adequate commonality. Certainly, this legislation contributes to that and builds on the pioneering work that was done in Victoria and makes it better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a whole range of areas in the administration of the Attorney&hyphen;General where evolving commonality is clearly desirable. Perhaps one of the closest examples to the processes involved in this legislation is the national automated fingerprint identification system&mdash;and that involves a very important collaborative effort between different jurisdictions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mention also the evolution of the role of the national exchange of police information process, the operations of the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence and the establishment and work of the National Institute for Forensic Science. There is a range of evolving areas where, as a national parliament and on a bipartisan basis, we ought to be doing everything possible to ensure that this greater degree of commonality between Australian jurisdictions continues to evolve. Obviously, the gun laws, in the context of the discussions here last year, are another important example of that on&hyphen;going evolution of commonality. This legislation, hopefully, will take that process forward in the very important area of forensic procedures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also seeks to strike the fundamentally important balance between ensuring the rights of the accused to fairness in the investigation and prosecution processes and ensuring that our law enforcement agencies have the advantage of the most up&hyphen;to&hyphen;date technical capacities in relation to investigation and prosecution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would imagine that the principal application of this legislation will be in the area of biological samples. In the forensic science area there is a range of other technologies that may relevant, including the analysis of textiles, for example, and the analysis of glass or metal specimens taken from crime scenes and the like. But I think it is in the biological specimens area that this will be the most relevant, and that is clearly a rapidly advancing area of technology and one which is very important for the reasons I have suggested. It is certainly a technology that has a very powerful capacity to implicate suspects. It also has, probably even more importantly, a very important power to exculpate or remove a suspect from consideration in relation to a particular offence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should not get too carried away by the importance of this&mdash;and I will get onto the point of not getting too carried away by the aura of science in a moment. In very serious offences such as murder, the scientific evidence may only be peripheral. In a large number of murder
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3848"> cases there would not be much doubt about the identity of the person who carried out the killing. The question before the court is usually one of intent rather than identity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to matters such as rape, often the courts are not dealing so much with identity or with the act of intercourse that may have occurred, but with the question of consent. The question of consent is often before the court in those matters. One should not be unduly carried away and think that this particular technology is going to solve all the problems, but it is clearly going to be important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It needs to be understood that the aura of science should not dominate process. Not too long ago, in the United States in particular, serious questions were asked in the courts about DNA sampling. For example, in the early 1990s, arising primarily from a case called the Castro case, the US National Academy of Sciences said that DNA technology was sufficiently questionable for it to call for its non&hyphen;admissibility in relation to court matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Earlier in this decade, the Tran case in New South Wales was often talked about as one which raised serious questions about the quality of the DNA evidence being presented in our courts. I am advised by forensic scientists&mdash;and I make no pretence of understanding the particular technologies in a scientific sense&mdash;that PCR technology is now commonly used in most Australian jurisdictions, though I think there is some doubt about what Tasmania uses. As I understand it, many of the problems related to the adequacy of the scientific techniques and the scientific methodologies of earlier technologies have now been overcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I add the cautionary note that forensic science is not without its faults and problems. The most notorious case in recent times in Australia was the Chamberlain case, which led to the 1987 Morling Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Chamberlain Convictions. It was found that the scientific evidence in that particular case was seriously flawed. According to Morling, a number of tests were done without the results being verified. It found that there was a failure to use adequate controls, particularly in testing blood samples from the Chamberlain car.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The commission also found that testing was done on articles from which a clear result could not be expected and that there was a failure to use a control or scientific methodology in such circumstances. The commission found a failure to take adequate account of the effects of heat in a car with the effluxion of time when interpreting test results.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Things have moved on considerably since that time but, nonetheless, as well as the findings of the Morling royal commission in relation to scientific evidence, there has been a range of other cases, such as the Stuart matter in South Australia and the Shannon royal commission, which found reasonable doubt as to the validity of scientific evidence used in the conviction of Edward Charles Splat. The list goes on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a tendency unfortunately, I would submit, for police, courts and juries to give an aura to scientific evidence. In many cases that aura is undesirable. It has led to a situation where, as a community, we need to make sure that there are rigorous controls in relation to the evolution of that science at all times and that an adequate balance is achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> This legislation has considerable merit in that respect but it is a matter that needs to be continuously and rigorously looked at if injustices are to be minimised in the future. It is very important in that process that the commonality of approach between jurisdictions in Australia be rigorously pursued. If there are major problems in scientific evidence in one jurisdiction, that will discredit similar evidence in other jurisdictions. It will create circumstances where not only do innocent people run the risk of being convicted&mdash;as was the case in the Chamberlain matter&mdash;but where guilty people are not convicted because the evidence is tainted.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3849"> This was the case earlier this decade, in my understanding, in the United States, where, as a result of the Castro case and the position argued by the Academy of Sciences in the US, there was very serious doubt. Guilty individuals who should have been convicted were not convicted because that evidence was not presented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are also questions of costs involved in this process. Once again, we do not want to get carried away, but it can be a very expensive technology. I understand that the Victorian Institute for Forensic Medicine charges something like a couple of hundred dollars to carry out elemental DNA testing. In some circumstances, that can rise significantly higher, so there are limitations on the utility of some of this stuff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also provides for the establishment of a database where blood samples are taken from individuals convicted of serious offences. That is going to be an extremely important tool to investigations provided it is properly managed and properly utilised in the same way as the national automated fingerprint identification system. But it is a more complex matter and a more difficult matter than fingerprinting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was a story in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 3 April which was headed, `Criminals in line for DNA database'. Perhaps the Attorney&hyphen;General, in winding up this particular debate, might be able to update us as to where the evolution of that particular proposal is. It is clearly a very important one, but it is one that, in the context of forensic evidence generally, because of its importance both in implicating and exculpating suspects, needs to be extraordinarily carefully managed if it is to retain credibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure that the database is not going to be particularly useful in prosecutions. I would have thought that if it was put before a court or a jury that a significant basis for prosecution was that the person had been checked off on the database and a match had been found, that would be clearly indicating to the jury that the person had prior convictions. By definition, a person is not going to be on the database if they have not had a prior conviction. A person is entitled to be tried without the jury having knowledge of prior convictions. How the database will be used in the process of prosecution or what the utility of it is in that respect is very much a matter for discussion. I would welcome any comments from the Attorney&hyphen;General on that. It is quite clear to me at least. I hope that the relevance of the database is going to be for investigation and not for prosecution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Overall, the opposition does support the bill, as I indicated at the outset. In fact, the member for Banks indicated that there are some modest improvements in the legislation as a result of the government picking up some of the Senate committee's points. We wish it rapid progress. But I have a feeling that the legislation is going to be back before the parliament in the not too distant future, given the fairly dynamic nature of this area and the evolution of forensic science for some further update, and that seems eminently sensible and appropriate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Crimes Amendment (Forensic Procedures) Bill 1997 is an example of parliament trying to keep pace with rapidly changing technology. It can be seen in a number of other areas that are readily used today such as the Internet, where our children find it very second&hyphen;nature. I think the older generation has some difficulty coming to grips with it. The problems are then with parliament. With it being prorogued, our major democratic system finally comes round to catching up, as it were, to technology.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The technology here is not very high flying. There are things as basic as fingerprinting. We have gone so far with DNA identification now that we can actually isolate genes which are
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3850"> causing a particular disease and treat embryos before they are born. There is the ability to clone animals, and there is some doubt whether the technology exists yet to clone human beings. Technology is presenting us with so many moral questions well ahead of our human and moral development to be able to answer any of those questions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While you have crime in the community, people's perception of crime escalates. They become very apprehensive about crime, demanding solutions to the problem that is affecting them in their environment. This is true especially of females in that the ordinary use of the community is severely curtailed by apprehension about their movements after dark, thinking, `Am I alone?' or `Is the taxi safe?' Every female suffers some curtailment of her ordinary right to the night by that fear of crime, especially rape and sexual abuse. That severely curtails females' rights to go about their business in society and it changes their behavioural patterns quite considerably.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Women are demanding some action on that. They can see where technology is going. They can see the extraordinary science that is available and they also see a number of alleged criminals beating the rap. Often in a lot of sexual abuse and rape crisis counselling the female is put on trial at the trial rather than the suspect. This sort of technology just facilitates the police roles and meets the public demand for not only apprehension but conviction. This sends a clear message to the community that crime does not pay&mdash;`You will be apprehended and the chances of you getting off are very narrow; we will have all sorts of technology to beat you.' Certainly in the future, the way that technology is going, that will be so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently, the forensic procedures we are looking at are really quite basic and non&hyphen;intrusive. I refer to the external examination of the genitalia or anal area, the buttocks, or, in the case of the female, the breasts; the taking of a sample of blood; the taking of a sample of saliva or a sample by buccal swab; the taking of a sample of pubic hair; the taking of a sample by washing from the external genitalia or anal area of the buttocks or, in the case of the female, the breasts; the taking of a sample by vacuum suction; scraping or lifting by tape from the external genital or anal area, the buttocks or, in the case of a female, the breasts; and the taking of a dental impression. These are not really the intrusive types of examination that is available and will get exceptional results.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The dignity of the suspect is also protected in a number of areas in terms of who is able to take that sample. It generally has to be an appropriately qualified person, generally a medical practitioner, a nurse or a dentist. In some cases, such as taking a sample of hair, other than pubic hair, or the taking of handprints, fingerprints, toeprints or footprints, it can be a constable. So we are setting up safeguards to protect the suspect's dignity. Obviously the samples will be taken by individuals of the same sex and there is the option to have the whole procedure videotaped or recorded. Again, that is protecting the suspect. They can decline to have a video taken and, again, that protects their dignity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also an important section, clause 23XU, which provides for the sharing of samples with the suspect. In other words, if any samples are collected, the suspect must be given an examinable amount so that he can carry out his own testing procedures, using his own expert. If there is not a sufficient amount taken to provide that, then he is entitled to be present when the appropriately qualified person tests that sample. That is an important preservation of the suspect's rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the member for Maribyrnong (Mr Sercombe) said, there is a lot of scepticism about technology today. I think the Lindy Chamberlain case was the classic case. There is scepticism
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3851"> about technology: yes it is high tech, yes it is very accurate, but how many people are experts? Whenever you introduce technology into a bureaucracy, and you give it to people who signed up as policemen 20 years ago to organise, there is some standardising that has to occur. There has to be some training and there has to be some expertise developed in the area to satisfy people's wariness of new technology. The classic example is radar traps. We are still having ongoing disputes about the use of radar in order to convict speeding motorists. That technology is still being challenged in the courts and the operators are being found to be wanting in some cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you introduce technology it has to be probably not as current as what is available, but it has to be sufficient that those currently in the field can get up to speed with it, and use it appropriately and accurately. It is the accuracy that is available to us with modern technology that is being sought and demanded by the public. They are demanding not just an apprehension or far flung accusations; they are demanding a conviction. This technology is there and, in the future, I think criminals will be very wary about their prospects of getting away with anything as more and more technology is incorporated into police procedure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently, we have seen a classic move in the drugs scene  where people have gone from secreting a drug in their luggage and passing it through Customs in various forms, to having it on the person, strapped around the body, and now to it actually being in bodily cavities. As technology moves and as police procedures move towards apprehension, the criminals, who do read papers and are aware of the movements and the powers of police, continue to move to avoid them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These procedures are just one step in the continual process of being able to apprehend and convict people who have committed crimes in our society. I think the member for Maribyrnong had some scepticism about the databases that can be created from these procedures. They are purely statistical and statistics are very important. He mentioned a few in relation to whether it was actually the intercourse in a rape case which was being disputed or whether it was the consent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With statistics, police can analyse where their cases are falling down and where further funds need to be spent to repair the holes in the prosecution case. With the statistics which will be collected on that database of samples and of convicted people, we will start being able to profile things. There are safeguards such that personal information relating to that sample can be deleted. It really is a database just to give us more information on crime and to analyse crime, criminals and our actual conviction procedures.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GK6">Miss JACKIE KELLY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is an important point too, because a lot of the material is time delayed. A lot of material has to be tested within a certain time, a lot of material has to be destroyed when it is tested. If that is so and that material is destroyed in the testing process, then the prosecution is unable to admit that in the case. It is only admissible by the suspect if the material is destroyed in the testing process, so any analysis out of that material cannot be used in evidence against them. That is safeguarding the suspect's right.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The whole movement today in criminal apprehension is always a balancing act between demands of society for the right to go about their business, and use public areas with immunity, and the individual's right to be treated with dignity, to be innocent until proven guilty and not to have to submit to a number of invasive or intrusive or degrading procedures to prove his innocence or otherwise. It is always a balancing act. This act has certainly got
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3852"> the balance fairly in favour of the suspects. You will still see a greater push by victims of violent crime wanting greater powers of investigation and greater certainty in conviction, and procedures where the witness does not have to go through the whole trial again with forensic evidence when a lot of circumstantial evidence is able to be produced which clearly puts the criminal at the scene of the crime. With an act of sexual intercourse or with drugs, it puts them fairly well in a limited narrow sphere where they are relying on defence such as consent or very legal technicalities to get out of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The important message is that the rope is closing. We are doing more. We are moving a fair way down the track to give the night back to females and to really frighten off the criminals with the certainty that they will be caught. We do have national legislation, which will gradually see adoption throughout all the states, where they cannot come to the ludicrous situation that occurred with one of my constituents. The sexual assault occurred in Tasmania, the offender went to Victoria, they moved to New South Wales, and nothing has happened because, out of the three jurisdictions, it all got too complex. Evidence collected in Tasmania would not be admissible in New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Very complex jurisdictional issues are a great loophole for criminals to scoot through. It is certainly something that we have to make a move to legislate on and give to Australians in such a mobile and fast&hyphen;moving society. We are no longer the Federation of 1901 of a two&hyphen;day draycart drive to Melbourne. Within an hour, you are changing states, you are getting out of jurisdiction and you are getting away with murder. It is important that we send a very national message that the rope is closing, it will not be tolerated and we will keep moving in this direction. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I want to start by thanking members who have spoken today, the member for Banks (Mr Melham), the member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith), the member for Maribyrnong (Mr Sercombe) and the member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly), for their valuable contributions. This bill does raise a number of difficult questions for us as legislators. As the member for Maribyrnong reminded the committee in the second reading speech, I indicated that it is a bill that is long overdue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At present there is no general Commonwealth law dealing with medical or forensic examination of persons in lawful custody. The state and territory laws on which the Commonwealth currently relies are often unclear and subject to varying and limited safeguards. As the member for Lindsay has pointed out in her concluding remarks, the virtues of uniformity are plain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill has been developed after a most exhaustive process of consultation. I believe that it achieves a right balance between the privacy of the individual and the needs of effective law enforcement. If that puts me at odds with the member for Lindsay who thinks that it favours the offender, then we will have to agree to differ.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does provide a comprehensive scheme for obtaining forensic samples, setting out in clear detail the powers and obligations of police and an exhaustive range of safeguards to protect the rights of individuals, with particular provisions for Aboriginal persons, Torres Strait Islanders, children and incapable persons. Unless a suspect gives his or her informed consent after receiving all of the relevant information, including the right to refuse, no intimate procedure may be performed except by order of a magistrate. To make that order, the magistrate must be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the person
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3853"> committed a relevant offence, that is, the same standard as for arrest. However, if a person is in lawful custody, non&hyphen;intimate procedures may be carried out by appropriately qualified persons, as ordered by a senior constable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further safeguards include: time limits for conducting procedures; the right to contact a lawyer and to communicate with him or her in private wherever possible; the right of certain suspects to interview friends; the right to an interpreter when necessary; tape recording of requests to consent and the conduct of procedures, and the provision of full information about the relevant procedure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most importantly, the bill includes a legislative barrier to the admissibility of evidence which is obtained from forensic procedures which are carried out in breach of the legislation. All procedures must be carried out by appropriately qualified persons. There is a right to have a medical practitioner of choice present during most procedures, and a medical practitioner of the same sex if practicable. There are limitations on the numbers of constables that may be present during the carrying out of a forensic procedure and restriction on the presence of opposite sex constables to cases of necessity. There are also comprehensive requirements for the destruction of forensic material after a conviction is secured or charges dropped.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is grateful for what might be described as the lack of opposition by the opposition to the bill, although the member for Banks did indicate that the opposition proposed to monitor the debate in order to see whether the bill could be improved during its passage through parliament. That is, of course, legitimate. It would help that if any deficiencies, or alleged deficiencies, are identified, they are made known to us so that the issue can be addressed and an appropriate answer can be given if there is one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Banks raised the issue of certain recommendations of the Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs not being accepted by the government. Among the Senate committee recommendations which were not taken up are some I will mention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recommendation 1 limits the operation of the bill to offences with a maximum penalty of five years or more. This has not been adopted. The relevant offences tend to have maximum penalties of two to five years, being offences against the person in the main. The most useful application of the procedures would be excluded if it were limited to those with a penalty of five years or more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Reference is made to dental impressions. I think the member for Banks acknowledged that there had been an advance in technology since the original bill was prepared. Evidence before the committee, I am advised, was in fact outdated and came from the mid&hyphen;1980s. The government has received up&hyphen;to&hyphen;date expert advice, which indicates that such evidence, using modern techniques, is both reliable and useful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third recommendation was that the examination of female breasts should only be in relation to alleged offences of over five years maximum penalty. Similar arguments apply to that as I offered in relation to the non&hyphen;adoption of the first recommendation. In certain crimes, especially violent or sexual crimes, evidence may be found on any part of the body, and the government saw no more reason to exclude the female breast area, subject to appropriate safeguards, than any other area of the body.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recommendation 9 was to the effect that the suspect definition be confined to persons a constable believes, rather than suspects, on reasonable grounds to have committed a relevant offence. That has not been picked up. That would have had the effect of excluding many people from the protections of the bill. The police could still seek their consent for procedures,
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3854"> as they can for non&hyphen;suspects, but the protections in the bill would not apply. Several other recommendations, which were not fully accepted, were in fact accepted in part or in spirit or implemented in a somewhat different way. Greater detail on these matters can be found in the government's formal response to the committee's recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Dickson expressed some concern about aspects of the bill relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, particularly the possibly patronising effect or appearance of provisions treating Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders as disadvantaged. He pointed out that this would be the case no matter how well educated or socially competent they may be. He gave an example in relation to the application of the lower two&hyphen;hour time limit for the procedures in relation to those people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That provision and similar provisions in part 1C of the Crimes Act, relating to pre&hyphen;charge investigation periods, were inserted following full consultation with Aboriginal organisations and also result from recommendations of the Senate committee. The government was aware of and concerned about the possibly patronising connotations. But those, it appears, were outweighed by the benefits of the provision in the eyes of the affected groups consulted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Maribyrnong expressed some reservations about the reliability of DNA evidence and he raised some questions about databases. The bill does not require a court to admit any forensic evidence and it does not require a jury to give forensic evidence any particular weight. It merely allows forensic evidence to be obtained and leaves the question of admissibility and the question of weight to the judge and to the jury as appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recent criticisms of DNA evidence are an understandable reaction to the widely held but inaccurate view that DNA matching can always conclusively determine guilt or innocence. In fact, the value of DNA evidence varies from case to case, depending on the quality of the sample at the crime scene, the nature of the tests performed and the distinctiveness of the DNA in question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In some cases DNA evidence will be of little value; in others, it may show a high probability that DNA found at a crime scene is the suspect's DNA. The defence can conduct its own analysis of the defendant's DNA. If it is able to create real uncertainty as to the reliability of DNA evidence on which the prosecution relies, a jury would be unable to find the defendant guilty beyond reasonable doubt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1996 Esteal<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Interim report on the establishment of a national convicted offender database</EMPHASIS> considered comprehensively the international evidence now available in this area and concluded that it is a powerful tool in law enforcement. It has the potential to reduce costs by eliminating suspects at an early stage and focusing the investigation to allow optimal use of investigation resources. Dr Esteal's final report is due to be presented to the Australasian Police Ministers Council meeting in July this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to databases, the bill does not establish any database, nor does it require any law enforcement agency to create a database, but it does recognise two kinds of existing databases. The first are identification databases, such as fingerprint databases, which contain a description of certain forensic material and the identity of the person from whom it was obtained. This allows police to match forensic material found at the scene of a crime against material in the database to identify suspects. However, as soon as forensic material is required to be destroyed, all information about that material must be removed from the identification database. All other material will be destroyed if proceedings have been unduly delayed, if the suspect is not
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3855"> convicted or if evidence arising out of the procedure is held to be inadmissible because there was a breach of the bill's requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other type of database that the bill recognises has a quite different purpose. Information about forensic material taken in accordance with the bill may be entered in a statistical database, but only in a form that cannot be used to identify any person. A statistical database of forensic material is a necessity. Much forensic evidence involves comparison with a large sample group. For example, the more DNA records the police have, the more accurately they can state the probability of two samples of DNA having come from the same source.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A couple of other matters were raised that I think warrant comment, not because they were critical, but in a sense because they were supportive and raised issues of some significance. In the course of raising questions as to the quality of some evidence, in particular DNA evidence, the member for Maribyrnong suggested that science should not dominate the process. I think what I have said in relation to DNA evidence in particular should answer that, in that at the broad level science does not under the rules of evidence dominate the process. And I do not think competent lawyers or courts will allow it to do so. The question of cost does arise, but that is really outside the terms of reference of this particular bill and no doubt will be a matter addressed in other forums, in particular those dealing with legal aid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Lindsay perhaps adopted a slightly different approach to some issues than other speakers. That might not be surprising, given that all the other speakers were male and the member for Lindsay is female. The principle that there should be certainty of identification, a high level of skill in investigation and therefore the probability of greater conviction is important in offering the community both assurance of protection and the fact of protection. Women in particular have a perception that there are great risks in the community. Statistically those risks are in fact quite slight and the perception is of a greater risk than there really is. This is well documented by work done by the Australian Institute of Criminology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Maribyrnong referred to the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence, the National Police and Research Institute and the Institute of Forensic Science and made the point that there is cooperation between different law enforcement agencies and, in particular, police forces, through these cooperative bodies. That is a very important point to be made. I think we could also add there that the Institute of Criminology, with its Criminology Research Council, similarly operates, in effect, as a cooperative body. There is a great deal of cooperation between the different law enforcement agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The existence of the ABCI, for example, enables the possible setting up&mdash;to give another example&mdash;of a paedophile database. The existence of the National Exchange of Police Information, another cooperative body, was crucial in setting up appropriate uniform procedures for registration and licensing of firearms under the uniform gun laws that have been introduced in the last 12 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The uniformity of law that would arise if each jurisdiction adopts a bill based on this model, a model developed by the Model Criminal Code Officers Committee, would be undoubted, a point emphasised by the member for Lindsay. The passage of this bill through this parliament will constitute a milestone in moving towards that target.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will hand up a replacement explanatory memorandum. This replaces the original one which was found to contain some minor errors, such as numbering errors, affecting a few sections, inaccuracies in describing the effect of two provisions and some typographical errors. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Child Support Act and associated regulations are by their very nature complex and technical, and they deal with very emotionally charged issues. The task of the Child Support Agency is, of course, an enormous one. It has responsibility for most areas of child support, from regulation to assessment, to collection of child support and payment to the custodial parents. It must also assess and adjudicate on any request for a variation of child support liability, based either on an estimate of changed circumstances or on any other review grounds contained within the act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been a number of problems with the Child Support Act, many of which were identified in the 1994 report of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues. Of course, those of us working in our electorate offices have people coming in daily talking to us about the human consequences of the problems of dealing in this highly vexed area and the act as it now stands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments contained in the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996, which is before the committee today, are designed to ensure that the child support system continues to evolve to meet its objectives in the future as best it can. They represent a number of commonsense administrative changes which were flagged by the joint select committee that I have just referred to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In particular, the Child Support Act was introduced to address the need for a better, more informed system of ensuring that a parent's child support and child maintenance obligations are assessed accurately and met regularly. The underlying principle of the child support system
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3857"> is that both parents, custodial and non&hyphen;custodial, have a joint obligation to provide for the care and upkeep of their children as best they can.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the child support legislation was first introduced, the stated objectives of the cabinet subcommittee on maintenance and child support were that: non&hyphen;custodial parents share in the cost of supporting their children according to their capacity to pay; adequate support is available to all children not living with both parents; Commonwealth expenditure is limited to the minimum necessary for ensuring that those needs are met; work incentives to participate in the labour force are not impaired; and the overall arrangements are non&hyphen;intrusive to personal privacy and are simple, flexible and efficient. These principles remain the guiding force in the government's consideration of the child support scheme and any reforms that are necessary. In particular, the final objective is addressed by these amendments being debated today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996 contains three main changes. These changes are to the estimates provisions, the employer withholding provisions and the treatment of child support liabilities by the Family Court. The bill also includes consequential changes to child support legislation to reflect changes made in the Social Security Act 1991, the Family Law Act 1975 and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. These changes are aimed at increasing flexibility for the Child Support Agency and for the parents involved, reducing the level of intrusiveness, and improving certainty and the clarity of the law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently, where the Child Support Agency is involved in the assessment of child support, it calculates the amount to be paid based on the non&hyphen;custodial parent's income from two years ago. This figure is offset against the income of the custodial parent once that income reaches a certain threshold.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the difficulties with this situation is that a person's economic and employment circumstances can change dramatically within a two&hyphen;year period. People may find themselves in a situation where the amount of child support that they are paying is much higher than if they were assessed on their current income&mdash;or, alternatively, it could be much lower.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently, to address this problem, the child support system incorporates an estimate procedure. Either parent can apply for a variation of child support payments if they believe that their income in the current year will vary by more than 15 per cent. The reassessment is then backdated to the end of the previous financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This process is fraught with practical difficulties. It often means that the custodial parent has to refund to the non&hyphen;custodial parent money that they have already spent on the care and upkeep of their children. It could have been spent on education, clothing, food, sporting activities or housing. It also may mean that the parent paying child support has to repay much of the amount which would be refunded later in the year when they may not be in a position to do so. So it is very often a lose&hyphen;lose situation, and it affects not just the parents, but the children. It may cause tensions and stress, as well as economic hardship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The provisions contained in the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996 will amend the effect of an income estimate election to make it less likely that a person receiving child support will be asked to repay amounts in the future, and they will make the effect of an income estimate election a much more accurate reflection of a paying parent's capacity to pay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Revised assessments, on the basis of an estimate, will apply only from the date that the estimate is lodged. These amendments allow that a custodial parent will not have to refund money that they have already received but, rather, any overpayment will reduce the amount
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3858"> that the non&hyphen;custodial parent is required to pay for the remainder of the year. The only exception to this would be when the amount payable, after the readjustment, is actually lower than the amount that has already been paid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another important change is that non&hyphen;custodial parents, when unemployed for part of the year, will not have to pay child support. The revised income estimate will be used by the Child Support Agency to reassess the amount of child support payable for that year. These measures, it is important to note, do not actually change the amount of child support that a person is liable to pay. They simply change the way in which any reassessments affect the timing of liabilities and ensure they reflect the person's ability to meet their child support obligations at any given time. These changes therefore address one of the main disadvantages for custodial parents who are having to repay child support that they have received and spent in good faith. It is a significant change for custodial parents, particularly those who may have a variable income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Such amendments are of particular importance for many people in my electorate where we have numbers employed as seasonal workers. It is very difficult for seasonal workers in the food producing, fruit picking and transport sector&mdash;which is very subject to seasonality&mdash;to accurately forecast what their income will be from one year to the next. Seasonal workers are often given short notice as to extension of their employment&mdash;extra overtime in the factory, some night work. Due to the uncharacteristically good season, they might find themselves with many more weeks of work than they had expected, at a higher pay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of these people are anxious to meet their child support obligations, as are all parents. Ensuring that they do not accumulate large arrears debts is also a major concern for them. Under the current system, if they lodge an estimate at the time their income is about to increase, the increased amount of child support is backdated to the end of the financial year. This can then be a disincentive for additional work. While parents are prepared to pay additional child support when their circumstances improve, being hit immediately with an arrears debt and even further increased payments is often unfair, and is certainly felt as unfair.</PARA>

The amendments to ensure that estimates only operate from the date they are lodged will help to alleviate their situation and ensure that the child support assessments reflect the non&hyphen;custodial parent's current financial position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Child Support Agency can collect child support in a number of ways. Another option for collection is that the paying parent pays the amount directly to the Child Support Agency. There is also the possibility for parents to reach a private arrangement between themselves as to the amount and payment of child support. In these cases, the support agency will not intervene unless the custodial parent has applied for a means tested social security benefit, for example, a supporting mother's pension or disability support pension. In these cases, the Child Support Agency must make a child support assessment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The evidence given to the 1994 Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues found that approximately one&hyphen;third of separated parents are clients of the Child Support Agency, while the rest have made private child support agreements. The Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996 seeks to amend the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988 to allow a payer of child support to make payments directly to the child support registrar in certain circumstances. Obviously, the main criteria will be that the registrar is
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3859"> satisfied that the person will meet their child support obligations. These are simple administrative measures, but they have some very important effects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At present, the Child Support Agency is often seen as invading the privacy of a non&hyphen;custodial parent when it takes employer withholding action. Even though that parent might have the very best intentions towards their family, they still feel a great sense of being accused of wrongdoing and wrong intent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These changes will reduce the intrusive nature of the child support collection process in many cases. The changes also provide greater flexibility in the way the child support payments are collected, which we expect will substantially reduce administrative costs. The changes will also reduce the compliance costs placed on employers who are directed to withhold child support payments, as more people will now be allowed to pay directly to the Child Support Agency if these amendments are passed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Such changes are especially important given the government's commitment to reducing paperwork and the costs for small businesses. While it may be relatively easy for large employers to meet their withholding obligations under the child support system, it is a further burden on small employers, especially when in many cases it is not necessary for them to be involved at all. This is particularly a problem where you have family members&mdash;perhaps the family of the custodial parent&mdash;employing the non&hyphen;custodial parent. Matters of privacy can become very important. In having to be directly involved in maintenance payments, there can be a lot of inter&hyphen;family stress.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to ensure that children are never disadvantaged in the event that child support is not paid on time, or at all. The child support register will maintain the primary responsibility to ensure the collection of child support in a timely manner. This, of course, is as it should be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments provide for strict safeguards in the event of default. If a person elects to pay directly to the Child Support Agency and then defaults in payment, there are a number of important safeguards in place which are to ensure that the children are not disadvantaged by the failure of non&hyphen;custodial parents to meet their child support obligations. If a person does default, the CSA can require that child support be withheld by a person's employer in the future and a payer will not be able to make another election for direct payment for six months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In most cases, payers who default after choosing to pay directly to the registrar, will have strictly limited future access to this provision. Where a person applies for direct payment to the registrar and this application is refused&mdash;presumably on the basis of a history of default&mdash;this person will not be able to apply for direct payment again for two months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These amendments reflect recommendations 55 and 57 of the joint select committee report and remove the situation where, under section 43 of the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act, the child support registrar is required, as far as practicable, to collect child support from the wages of the employed, liable parents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that the practice of the Child Support Agency, in compliance with this legislation, is that, as soon as they become, or are made aware, of the employer of a non&hyphen;custodial parent, they take action to commence employer withholding. Often the first notification that the person has that their salary is being withheld to meet their child support obligations is when they receive a reduced pay packet, or their employer advises them of the notice that they have received to make these deductions. That is hardly fair and, as I said
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3860"> before, can lead to very substantially exacerbated tensions between the parents of the child. In this case, of course, the child suffers as much as the parents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Evidence presented by the Child Support Agency to the joint select committee indicated that there had been an improved level of voluntary compliance. For example, it was reported that 56 per cent of all child support liabilities registered under the scheme were paid on time and that almost half of these were paid without the use of automatic withholding. It is important that parents are given the opportunity, where appropriate, to pay their child support voluntarily, and these amendments help to make that happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill will also amend the Family Law Act. The amendments will mean that the court can take child support liability into account when ruling on property and spousal maintenance issues, even where a child support assessment has not been issued. This will help to ensure that property settlements more accurately reflect the true situation of both the parties and take into account the impact that future child support liabilities may have upon the non&hyphen;custodial parent's financial situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is clearly desirable in family law matters that parties reach agreement on pivotal issues such as child support. However, the current arrangements mean that parties must apply for a child support assessment&mdash;even where they wish to make private arrangements&mdash;before the court can take into account those commitments when making orders regarding property or spousal maintenance. These amendments reflect the position that all parents should be treated in the same manner, and we support that strongly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I support the changes proposed today as practical and sensible amendments to the child support legislation. The business of taking care of children in a situation of separated parents is one that the state must overview&mdash;in this case the nation&mdash;but we must also give parents the greatest possible chance to continue to live in harmony so that their harmonious relationships offer the best possible chance of parenting to their children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In particular, I should also add that we believe that these amendments are supported by both sides of the House and we believe that they have had a strong investigation by both parties in previous times as joint select committees have worked through the issues. In particular, these amendments give parents dignity and a greater chance to continue cooperative relationships. I therefore commend the bill to the Main Committee.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the member for Murray (Mrs Stone) has indicated, there are few areas of government responsibility that raise emotions more than matters pertaining to family law. Certainly, since its introduction, the Child Support Act has created a lot of angst within the Australian community. It is an act that is in need of reform, there is no doubt about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before going on to those matters, however, I think it is important to recognise that the system we have today is much better than the system we had previously. The introduction of the Child Support Act was probably the biggest shake&hyphen;up in terms of family law in this country since the introduction of the Family Law Act of 1975. It was an important initiative, one which has delivered to this country a much better system than we had previously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It addressed the high cost of applying for maintenance before the courts in this country. We must remember that, before the introduction of the scheme, only about 26 per cent of sole parents were in receipt of some form of maintenance from the non&hyphen;custodial parent. It addressed the problem of the lack of indexing of the commitments of non&hyphen;custodial parents as determined by courts of the land.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3861">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It overcame the difficulties inherent in enforcing court orders. We can now rely upon the tax system and the powers of the Child Support Agency to ensure that non&hyphen;custodial parents in this country make their contribution, quite rightly, to the children they have fathered or mothered. The previous situation was unacceptable. We had a situation in this country where it was the taxpayer generally, through the provision of the sole parents pension, that was carrying the maximum weight of the cost of raising these children, rather than the responsibility being sheeted home to the person responsible for fathering or mothering the child, that person no longer having contact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The scheme was a very important initiative and I think that, as a matter of principle, it enjoys the support of both sides of this parliament. But it is desperately in need of reform. That is why today I am supporting in this place the amendments put forward by the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham). This bill, while I welcome its initiatives and while I am happy to say that it will go some way towards addressing some of the inadequacies of the scheme, does not go far enough. It fails rather poorly to pick up the recommendations of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues. I know that a number of those on the other side will say that the former Labor government failed to put them into practice, but we were getting there. Many of them were introduced or picked up, and the reform process was continuing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I always remind myself, as a member of this place, to remember that one day&mdash;fingers crossed&mdash;I may be in government. I remind myself to be very careful about the things I say in this place, because they do have a habit of coming back to bite us. In my first 12 months in this place I have watched with great interest the transformation of many of those on the other side as they have felt their way into government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Child Support Agency was a great ogre in the eyes of many on the other side when they were in opposition. Now, 14 months into this government, what we see is this Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996, which does very little indeed to address the inadequacies of the system. I point that out to members on the other side with some great pleasure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Government members interjecting</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8K6">Mr FITZGIBBON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My team introduced the scheme in the first place. You will remember, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the success of the scheme was originally underestimated. No&hyphen;one ever dreamed that the success of the child support scheme would be so large. It was originally under&hyphen;administered; not enough money was going into the scheme to enable those very hardworking members of that area of government to properly administer the scheme. That is slowly being addressed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former Labor government picked up many of the recommendations of the joint select committee, and that process was ongoing. Having heard the whining from the other side when they were in opposition, this is their attempt at fixing up the child support scheme. They are making a few very minor changes which I welcome, as I said, but they are going to do very little to address the problems faced by both custodial and non&hyphen;custodial parents in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that, very subtly, many of them have raised concerns that they have on a wider basis. They have all given examples of how they continue to experience problems with the system, particularly with respect to non&hyphen;custodial parents, and yet their bill before the House today does very little to address those problems&mdash;and there are plenty of problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very dangerous for a male member of this place to do so, but I have seen too many cases where non&hyphen;custodial males are being absolutely devastated by this scheme&mdash;not to say
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3862"> that I think the pendulum has swung too far the other way. It was the case that, prior to the introduction of the scheme, the non&hyphen;custodial males were getting away with murder. They were being carried by the Australian taxpayer. Now, instead of the pendulum swinging back to the centre, I think it has gone a little too far the other way. Now there are too many male, non&hyphen;custodial parents out there with problems&mdash;and, indeed, female, non&hyphen;custodial parents as well. Although I have not come across them, I am sure they are out there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know how dangerous it is to say this because I know that whenever someone prefaces a racial remark by saying, `But, let me say, I am not a racist,' I immediately come to the conclusion that they are. My preface in signalling my concerns about non&hyphen;custodial parents is not going to help me much, but I felt an obligation to say it. I also feel an obligation to say that the system is acting as a disincentive to many workers because, over time, it is not a proposition to them anymore; it is not worth their while.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The system is leaving many non&hyphen;custodial parents with no opportunity to start again. It is leaving them without the financial means to start life again. And, of course, those financial strains also flow on to strains on the relationship with their second partners and, subsequently, this can lead to a second breakdown and another child support liability&mdash;and it goes on and on. For the non&hyphen;custodial parent, the whole thing can be disastrous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The scheme does not take into account a child's income. Theoretically, if I separated from my wife, I could have a 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;old child earning $80,000 a year and still have a liability to my ex&hyphen;wife. It does not take into account the income of the new partner of the custodial parent: if I had an ex&hyphen;wife, she could be living with or be remarried to someone earning $1 million a year and yet my liability to my children would not change. Obviously, in those situations, my commitment should remain. I should always have a liability to my children&mdash;and I am pretty confident that most non&hyphen;custodial parents believe they should have, too&mdash;but commonsense must prevail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the introduction of the actual means test used to assess one's eligibility for Austudy, we now take into account much more the direct income stream of the parents involved. We look at a few other functions as well, including their expenditure patterns and other liabilities they might have as a family. It would make a lot of sense to apply those same principles to the child support legislation because, for example, it does not now take into account the cost incurred by the non&hyphen;custodial parent at those times when he or she enjoys the company of the children. When you are estranged from your children, you want to give them the very best during those short periods you have with them. You want to treat them; you want to take them out; you want to take them to the show, and you want to buy them good things. Under the child support scheme, your liability does not take into account the cost involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I think there is some scope for some big changes there. Probably the more important point to make is that we in this place should be talking about family law generally rather than restricting ourselves to amendments to the child support scheme. For example&mdash;just to quote one case&mdash;I have a very distressed constituent who has a child support liability to, I think, six children. He is a coalminer and therefore enjoys a pretty reasonable income. But his liability to child support is very large, as you can imagine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> He is not complaining about that; he pays almost happily. What he is concerned about is the welfare of his children. When the custody was being determined, while his ex&hyphen;wife enjoyed the benefits of the support of legal aid, he did not. He was forced to represent himself before the Family Court and his child support liability was so large that he was left with no money
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3863"> with which to engage a solicitor. In any case, because he was the male in the relationship, his chances of success in terms of his attempts to gain custody of the children were minuscule. The ex&hyphen;wife was granted custody and now he has an ongoing concern about the welfare of those children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all have cases come into our office regularly, and often they are very sad cases. But we always treat them very carefully because we know that there are always two sides of the story. But over time, I have done the dangerous thing and come to accept&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank my colleague, the member for Port Adelaide, for that little bit of advice. It is so true. But I have come to lean towards the man's side of the story. I have become concerned about the children as well, because of some of the incidences that he relates to me. As a member of parliament, I am in no place to make a judgment about these matters and, indeed, the Department of Community Services in New South Wales is equally concerned. Of course, they cannot move until the situation is absolutely drastic.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So where does my constituent turn? He cannot go back to the courts to appeal the custody decision because he has no money, mainly because of his child support liability. So he is forced to sit back and wear the current Family Law Act and many of the inequities contained within it. So we cannot just take the child support legislation on its own and pretend that we are going to seriously address the family law issues facing this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a start and I welcome it. As I said, the recommendations contained within it are helpful and will address many of the inequities, particularly those that are introduced when an overpayment, or an underpayment, is raised. I think this is a much more sensible way of addressing those problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, as the member for Werriwa points out in his amendment, this bill reflects the absolute lack of commitment on the part of the government to address the real issues contained within the child support legislation. It displays absolutely their unwillingness, now that they are in government, to address the real issues in terms of family law and, while we are not denying the bill a second reading, of course, I think that it is important to highlight that fact. I commend the amendments of the member for Werriwa to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Child Support Agency has at least 2,500 clients in the electorate of Dunkley, across all income ranges and family types. In every suburb throughout the electorate people are experiencing contact with the Child Support Agency. The marriage and relationship education courses in Frankston and other Peninsula locations are offering people improved encouragement so that they do not find themselves in the situation of having to separate from their children and from their partners, and basically to help them get on with the rest of their lives. The Child Support Agency is an important part of the institutional framework that seeks to ensure that the children of discontinued relationships continue to be cared for and develop with the support of both parents, where their parents move on to pursue separate lives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I like about this child support legislation is that it seeks to further humanise this institutional framework with changes that ensure that the legal and administrative arrangements can take account of real people's lives and their individual circumstances. The bill before this committee will not be the last word on changes to the child support scheme or family law. It is a partial response to some of the recommendations from the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues, whose November 1994 report has been well documented. It is the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3864"> same report that the predecessors, the former Labor government, found too difficult to deal with, but who are now very keen in chanting from their stalls what this government should do about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to look at some of the remarks members opposite are making, and particularly the amendments offered by the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham). Again, there was very little in the way of constructive contribution to addressing these significant problems but more evidence that Labor is happy to sit back, chant from the sidelines, but leave it to the coalition parties to make some useful changes to this situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a member elected in 1996, I am well aware that this inquiry received 6,197 submissions, the highest ever for any parliamentary committee in our country. I remind the House that non&hyphen;custodial parents made 3,292 submissions, or 53 per cent of the submissions, and custodial parents 32 per cent. Further changes are required to respond fairly and effectively to the many issues raised during the inquiry and since then, and I am committed to pursuing them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996 is a start. Today's bill addresses three areas. It aims to make income estimate elections notified by parents paying child support a more accurate reflection of their ability to pay. So when a payer's income drops more than 15 per cent, and they lodge an income election, their future liability will be reduced, rather than the complicated and annoying system that operates at present. This will lessen the chances of parents who receive child support already spending the money but not being aware that the paying parents income election has changed the amount of moneys effectively due.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fewer payees will be required to repay overpaid amounts of child support, and payers who are unemployed for part of the year will not be required to pay child support. The child support system will be better able to accommodate changing circumstances of the non&hyphen;custodial parents. As I was saying, this change will help to avoid the hardship created when the agency seeks to recover payments from custodial parents who may well have already spent the money on raising the children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the bill seeks to reduce the big brother nature of the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988 where it is unnecessary. The amendment allows child support payers with a good record to make payments directly to registrars rather than going through employers. Importantly, a person must have a good payment record before he or she can make payments in this way. If a default occurs, payers will not be able to remit moneys directly to the registrar for another six months. In the meantime, they will have to revert to garnishee orders through their employer as a penalty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, the Family Law Act is to be amended to enable people voluntarily paying child support to have that taken into account when the Family Court is making a property or spouse maintenance order. No longer will court orders fail to reflect the true circumstances of a person already paying child support. This measure will remove the current disincentive for parents of goodwill towards each other after a separation who have amicably entered into an arrangement for a child's care only to have these private arrangements ignored when the Family Court makes orders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I support any measure that enhances the opportunity and likelihood for private and satisfactory agreements to be entered into. I endorse the comments of the Attorney&hyphen;General who, in this House on December 4 1996, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most people . . . would prefer to deal with the whole process of separation and associated agreements over children, property and maintenance outside the court environment.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3865">  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As with most members, my office receives case after case of constituents' concerns regarding child support and family law. I would just like to compliment all the staff in electorate offices from all sides of the House who have to deal with these cases. They are often very emotional, very highly charged and very difficult to deal with, and I extend congratulations and best wishes to the staff of the Child Support Agency who I suspect experience similar exchanges with people involved with the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to point to a couple of examples. They highlight how the difficulty with the Child Support Agency is not typically skewed to one party, whether it is a matter of gender or custodial responsibilities. I have a constituent in Mornington who says it is all too easy for custodial parents to deny access, to make false accusations and have them acted upon through intervention orders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My constituent says there is no accountability and there is no deterrent against vexatious accusations that are costly to defend. He asserts that people can perjure themselves in the Family Court with apparent immunity. If you do not have the means to be able to take that matter further, then simply your access to your family members is curtailed because of those accusations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a female constituent in Karingal who has equally valid concerns. Her case is more complicated&mdash;it dates back almost a decade. Some ambiguous, badly drafted order from the Family Court has been interpreted by the Child Support Agency in such a way that she is now faced with having to refund over $3,000 of payments. I doubt, quite sincerely, that there has been an overpayment at all. It again shows the difficulty that many people experience with their interaction between the Family Court and the Child Support Agency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we turned to the Family Court for assistance it was unable to access any records to shed any light on this case. Now this person has the difficulty of not only raising the children but also having the fear of the $3,000 hanging over them, which the Child Support Agency asserts&mdash;and I greatly doubt&mdash;needs to be refunded. The performance of the Child Support Agency has improved; I will not go over that, but it is an encouraging sign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the first step and there is more work to be done. I cannot see how people can expect to look for better behaviour from people who have gone through a difficult, emotional, and often very financially significant, experience such as a separation, if the system is not structured to encourage it. Far too many non&hyphen;custodial parents come into my office, despairing at the difficulty they are having in re&hyphen;establishing their lives. They have moved on to new relationships, they may even have new families, but because of some of the arrangements that are in place at present they find it very difficult to make a fresh start.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They point to the way that entitlements and payments are calculated and that the circumstances of the other former partner are not taken into account in the same way in which their own are. The capacity of both former parents to contribute to the raising of the child does not seem to be equally investigated. At the end of the day that is the key; it is what is in the best interests of the child.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Far too many people come into my office&mdash;excuse me if these terms are unparliamentary&mdash;and elect to take the `stuff it' option. It is just too much for them. They wonder why they are working very hard to try and re&hyphen;establish their lives and to make an appropriate contribution to the care of children from former relationships, only to find that they just cannot make ends meet. One partner explained to me how, upon separation, all the family furniture and the family house was provided to the parent who was going to continue the primary custodial duty.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3866"> That person tries to generate additional income through overtime so that the fruit boxes that are used as chairs in the lounge room can be replaced. But every time that extra effort is made, more of the resources go out of that person's pocket into the custodial person's pocket, in the non&hyphen;custodial person's eyes without due cause. That person is saying, `Hang on, the capacity to raise the children is something that we share; it's a responsibility we both have to bear, and as our lives move on, surely the circumstances of both of the original parents should play a larger role in calculating the child support payments.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was somewhat disappointed that some very constructive measures that the subcommittee of government backbenchers put to the government were not incorporated in the budget. Some members on the other side might find that as an opportunity to have a go at us. But what I am suggesting to you is that work is going on; we understand that there are problems here. I also understand and accept the government's position that some well&hyphen;intended, well&hyphen;researched ideas do need to be carefully looked at by government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But my message to the government is that we have not gone away, that those concerns remain, and our efforts to address them will continue. The great disappointment in the motion of the member for Werriwa and the contribution of the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) is that they were simply carping away, saying there were issues that have not been resolved&mdash;that is right; we understand that&mdash;just as the more contentious recommendations in the joint standing committee's report were left on the shelf by the previous Labor government. There is no gain in their contributions. There are families out there battling to make ends meet and that contribution is absolutely useless to the task that is before us. I encourage all those members opposite who have a contribution to make, to make it in a positive way. These are real people's lives and they are doing it pretty hard out there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In sticking with the theme of encouraging people to do the right thing, the member for Moreton (Mr Hardgrave) outlined, in his contribution, some of the ideas that we have been working through. These include: the way entitlements are calculated; how income is treated; what level of payment should be made once someone gets to 2&half; times the average weekly earnings; how the custodial parents' circumstances change and how they should be addressed; the amount of exempt income so that people can get on with their lives; and the cost of raising children. If the task of raising the child is beyond the means of the two partners, we then have to look at whether our family payments system is supporting the raising of that child.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Payments for child support should represent one of the first obligations all non&hyphen;custodial parents have. If, after making those payments, their circumstances leave them in such an impoverished state that they are not able to carry on with their own lives, and perhaps the raising of other children that have come about from a subsequent relationship, we should take that into account. That costs money. We have to argue our case well and we are endeavouring to do that. I respect the government's role in making sure we are not doing anything too hasty that is not going to improve the situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue about how reviews are conducted also troubles me. From the research I have done, the approach of the Child Support Agency seems to vary from state to state. I wonder whether it is not time to introduce the same sort of statement of principles you see operating in the Department of Veterans' Affairs so that all cases are dealt with equitably.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a state such as mine, a review application for child support payments far too often sees arrears wiped off. The fact is that it is money that the custodial parents would and should have had in their pockets to help with the raising of the child but it is wiped off. I understand that
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3867"> there is a totally different practice in Queensland. That is unacceptable. They are all Australians. They are all facing similar dilemmas and they should all be treated reasonably equitably.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also believe there is an argument that says the question of visitation to children should be linked with people's performance in honouring their child support obligations. For people who cannot see their way clear to honour those obligations, I think there is an argument that says that the benefits and the joy of being involved with the development of your child should be curtailed. People say that that is harsh and unfair but, at the end of the day, it is about making sure the resources are available for the education, learning, training, growth, feeding, clothing and housing of the young child. If people cannot see their way clear to honour those responsibilities, I wonder whether they should be able to have as active a part in the rearing of that child.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But there is a flip side to that for those non&hyphen;custodial parents who are paying their way, and who find themselves in a situation where the custodial parent decides to move to Queensland with the child, which is often the case in the sunny Mornington Peninsula&mdash;sadly, some do not appreciate the beauty of our environment. I try to understand what it would be like if, heaven forbid, my relationship broke down and I was not able to have a role in the development of my child. I would consider that an enormous loss.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would want the opportunity to make a contribution in the development of something that I have played a part in creating so that needs to be weighed into the equation. If that means that the cost of gaining access to the child has to be somehow reflected in the payments, so be it. If that means that the non&hyphen;custodial parent has to look at those visitation rights, and if it means that the Family Court and the Child Support Agency have to consider how they can more effectively interact so that the two sets of issues mesh more comfortably, then we should also be looking at that. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Airservices Australia altered the inbound and outbound Visual Flight Rules (VFR) flight paths west of Jandakot Airport on safety grounds following consultation with the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. The changes were necessitated by the proposed demolition of the power station chimneys near James Rocks which, because of their high visibility, had been used as a VFR entry point to Jandakot Airport for aircraft arriving from the</PARA>
<PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">north&hyphen;west. It became necessary to define an alternative prominent visual feature readily identifiable by pilots operating under VFR conditions. Catherine Point was considered as the most suitable prominent visual feature.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The change to the arrival route also necessitated a change to the outbound route. Preston Point was identified as the most suitable feature to mark a new outbound route.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) The flight paths were altered on 20 June 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) The decision was made by Airservices Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) &amp; (d) No. The matter is one which falls within Airservices Australia's area of responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) No.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) &amp; (4) Details of the proposed changes were provided to members of the Jandakot Airport Consultative Committee at its meeting on 20 May 1996. The proposed changes were also discussed at the Committee's previous meeting on 4 December 1995. The Committee includes representation by State and local government agencies, Federal and State Members of Parliament and community groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) Prior to implementing the changes, Airservices Australia undertook an assessment of the number of persons likely to be affected by the changed flight paths. The assessment indicated that the number of persons likely to be affected was not significantly different from the numbers affected by the previous flight paths.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) Data is not separately available on the number of aircraft movements which occur on the western flight paths.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) (a) The Jandakot Airport noise study, which has been undertaken on behalf of the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC), was originally scheduled for completion in September 1996. However, commencement of the field work associated with the social survey and measurement of aircraft noise was delayed due to unseasonably wet winter conditions in Perth which reduced activity levels at Jandakot, together with a community view that aircraft noise levels and the impact of aircraft noise on local residents would be more effectively assessed in the busier spring and summer months. Analysis of the field data then took longer to complete than originally scheduled by the consultant, which has led to a delay in completion of the study.</PARA>

The Government was pleased to receive the report in August 1996, and to see that the Commissioners had taken a practical, constructive and realistic approach, and had produced a valuable contribution to international thinking and discussion on nuclear disarmament which could take us closer to the goal of a world free of nuclear weapons. It was in these terms that I presented the report to the Conference on Disarmament on 30 January, as I had done earlier to the United Nations General Assembly and the United Nations Secretary General in New York in September 1996.</PARA>

The Government was especially pleased that the approach adopted by the Commissioners was practical, realistic and thought&hyphen;provoking. We take the report and its recommendations seriously, and in that spirit we are urging its careful consideration by all governments. Australia's embassies have distributed the report around the world, including in the nuclear weapon states.

Its major investigative Program is Program 1: Investigation of crimes against the Commonwealth, which includes the investigation of drug related crime. In investigating drug related crime, the AFP also draws upon resources covered by each of the other three Programs None of the Budget or Program documents address the allocation of AFP resources to any specific area of criminal activity. The AFP records expenditure in relation to specific operational objectives but not in relation to particular categories of criminal activities. Criminal activity

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) Section 235 of the Customs Act 1901 already provides that where a person is convicted of importing a commercial quantity of an illicit drug, he or she may be imprisoned for life. Subsection 4B(2A) of the Crimes Act 1914 provides that where the offence provides for a maximum penalty of life imprisonment the person may also be fined up to $200,000. Further, there are extensive powers in Division 3 of Part XII of the Customs Act 1901 to confiscate property (such as motor vehicles, aeroplanes and boats) used in the commission of drug offences and to impose pecuniary penalties which allow the Commonwealth to deprive the offender of his/her benefits derived from commercial drug dealing through the sale of property. In view of the existing penalties, there is not much scope for increasing them. However, with the Attorney-General's encouragement all drug offences (State, Territory and Commonwealth) have been reviewed as part of the Model Criminal Code exercise. It is expected that a discussion paper on serious drug offences will be released by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General in the near future. The paper will look at ways of improving the effectiveness of our laws and reducing differences between State, Territory and Commonwealth drug laws.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Will he (a), in conjunction with the Minister for Health and Family Services and the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, undertake to develop a strategy to encourage healthy dietary habits in Australian schools and (b) review the sales tax arrangements relating to sound dietary products provided at school canteens, with a view to reducing their costs in comparison with less healthy alternatives.</PARA></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Flavoured milk has been subject to the concessional rate of sales tax (currently 12 per cent) since 1986.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Flavoured milk receives comparatively favourable tax treatment over soft drinks and other carbonated beverages (which are taxed at the 22 per cent rate). Flavoured milk is also not disadvantaged compared with substitutes such as fruit juices, which are also taxed at 12 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is also worth noting that plain milk, which would generally be available at school canteens, is exempt from sales tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most food, including healthy dietary food, is generally exempt from sales tax. However, confectionery is subject to the concessional rate of sales tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) (a) School education in Australia is the constitutional responsibility of the State and Territory Governments, and as such the Commonwealth does not intervene in specific curriculum matters. However, the Commonwealth does have a strategic role in setting national directions and policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1989, the State, Territory and Commonwealth Ministers of Education endorsed ten common and agreed national goals for schooling in Australia. Part of this strategy involves Health and Physical Education, which aims to expand students' knowledge and understanding of a range of issues, including "the role of food". This learning area includes a study of food's nutritional value, dietary trends and other factors that influence dietary practices, and as such provides an opportunity to educate Australian children about the importance of healthy dietary habits. All States and Territories are implementing some version of this strategy in their own systems. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the Department of Health and Family Services has informed me that it has already taken significant steps towards addressing the promotion of healthy dietary habits in Australian schools through the National Nutrition Education in Schools Project (NNESP), and the National Health Promoting Schools Initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The NNESP undertook intensive research and development in the area of health, food and nutrition education in schools over the period from December 1992 to June 1995 with the aim of encouraging health promoting behaviour in the area of food and nutrition in students from kindergarten to year 12 throughout Australia. The project maintains that students must not only develop food and nutrition knowledge, but must also develop skills in critical thinking, decision making, problem solving, food preparation, food selection and advocacy. The project is now in its second phase with educators being trained in providing the necessary skills to students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Health Promoting Schools initiative seeks to build on and learn from international, national, state and local community initiatives to establish a supportive environment of promoting the health and well&hyphen;being of all members within the school community, through the establishment of school based policies and activities to support the lessons taught in the classroom. The activities proposed to be undertaken within the project aim to build capacity to support the health promoting schools concept at local, state and national levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) As noted above, the current sales tax system already provides concessional treatment to flavoured milk, while plain milk is exempt from sales tax. In addition, most food, including healthy dietary products, is already exempt from sales tax.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will be shortly releasing the report of the Vietnam Veterans Mortality Study which will provide substantial information about deaths of male Vietnam veterans. The report analyses the 3,249 deaths that were reported in Australia up to 31 December 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The Department of Defence has advised that most Australian personnel served in Vietnam between 23 May 1962 and 11 January 1973, a small guard unit remained in the Embassy until 1 July 1973 and some RAAF personnel served during the evacuation of the Embassy in April 1975.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) This matter falls within the portfolio responsibilities of my colleague, the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Of the 58,230 male Army, Navy and Air Force personnel who served in Vietnam 499 died in Vietnam. A further 3,249 died between the time they returned to Australia and 31 December 1994.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) I do not know how many personnel committed suicide in Vietnam. The mortality study identified 242 deaths of Vietnam veterans due to suicide since returning to Australia, but estimates that the actual number may be around 280 (the report of the mortality study elaborates on this point in greater detail).

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) No. One of the initiatives being taken in the EIS process for the second airport is the release of discussion papers before the release of the draft EIS. The first, which was released on 5 February 1997, covered aviation traffic forecasts and a paper on the preliminary airport master plans was released on 19 March 1997. Papers outlining the approach to be taken to the assessment of aircraft noise and the options for road and rail access to the airport sites were released on 15 April 1997. A paper is expected to be released shortly on preliminary flight paths. The resources allocated by Rust PPK to the community consultation program will increase, if necessary, to respond to community interest in these papers.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Preliminary master plans for the proposed airport development were released by the Government on 19 March 1997.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australia Council has provided the following advice:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Yes, $80,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Yes. The 1997 Program Grant application from SYNERGY requested $140,000. This represented a 100 per cent increase on SYNERGY's 1996 grant and the proposed program of activities was much larger than in 1996. The Program Grant 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> category was particularly competitive in this grant round and the Fund was unable to provide the requested level of support. In these circumstances, the Fund felt that its grant should be focused on maintaining SYNERGY's core subscription season, not on expanding its activities. The joint project with ELISION, proposed as a `value added incentive' to SYNERGY's core subscription season, was therefore not supported.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) No. ELISION is in receipt of a multi&hyphen;year grant of $67,000 for 1996 and 1997, approved by the Music Committee of the previous Performing Arts Board in September 1995. Under the terms of this grant, ELISION is required to submit a program of activities and budget, but the specific works included in this program are determined by ELISION. The Music Fund does not place stylistic restrictions on repertoire choice by funded ensembles.  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) The Music Fund is supporting a range of experimental and innovative music projects in 1997, including commissions, recordings and performance projects. The Fund is also supporting modernist composers directly through Development Grants and Fellowships and indirectly through the services of the Australian Music Centre which receives major support from the Fund.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The Government is still considering the management options for ANSTO's stockpile of spent fuel rods. It is too early to be able to give a definitive answer as to what management option the Government will take and where a facility, if any, would be built. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3921"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Yes I am aware of the statement made by Senator Parer. The statement that processing the spent fuel rods would involve significantly lower levels of radioactivity than those already associated with ANSTO's current radio&hyphen;pharmaceutical production is based on calculations by ANSTO that radio&hyphen;pharmaceutical production on site involves processing 30kg of irradiated uranium containing 1017 Becquerels of radioactivity each year, while processing one hundred spent fuel rods a year would involve only some 14kg of irradiated uranium and about fifty times less radioactivity. These calculations do not appear in any publicly available document or report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) See answer to 1. The Government does not have under consideration the building of a commercial scale facility anywhere in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) The recent OECD publication, `The NEA Co&hyphen;operative Program on Decommissioning&mdash;The First Ten Years 1985&hyphen;95', lists three irradiated uranium processing facilities that have been decommissioned and completely decontaminated, and a number of others are in various stages of decommissioning.

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) are you aware that the Mid Plan report on the National Action Plan for Dementia Care noted the vital importance of dementia counselling services, largely developed through State Alzheimer's associations.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) If you are aware of this, why is the Government withdrawing funding for the five rural counsellors in New South Wales, including Orange and Dubbo, and expecting such services to be mainstreamed through the Home and Community Care service, which is underresourced and underskilled, to carry out such a vital service for the increasing number of home based rural dementia patients.</PARA></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) and (2) I am aware of the report and the Department of Health and Family Services has been working with the Reference Group in response to the proposed actions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The Counselling services are an initiative of the National Action Plan for Dementia Care. The Government recognises that the needs of people with dementia and their carers will not cease when the Action Plan ends.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In order to assist the Government in its consideration of how the needs of people with dementia and their carers can continue to be met in the future I have invited members of the Reference Group for the National Action Plan for Dementia Care to give me their views on the next steps for dementia care in Australia. I will consider their recommendations and the outcomes of the National Action Plan for Dementia Care in due course. Implications for Home and Community Care Program services will be assessed as part of these considerations.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The measure to introduce a single classification system and assessment instrument across the residential care sector from 1 July 1997 will ensure that residents will be funded according to their care needs no matter where they are. The development of this new instrument will take proper account of both the physical and mental frailty of residents and match this to an appropriate level of funding. Consistent with and complementary to the Reform Package is the National Carer Action Plan which aims to improve support for carers, including carers of People with dementia.</PARA>
