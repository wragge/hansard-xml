<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have pleasure in tabling the government's response to the report of the Small Business Deregulation Task Force. The government's response is the fulfilment of yet another election promise of the coalition parties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government thanks the members of the task force, which was chaired by Mr Charlie Bell, the Managing Director of McDonald's, for their work in developing a comprehensive blueprint of practical reforms to significantly reduce the burden of regulation and red tape on Australia's small businesses. The Bell report was entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Time for business</EMPHASIS> and, appropriately, the government's response is entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">More time for business</EMPHASIS>&mdash;it is all about giving small business men and women in Australia more time to be productive in their businesses. The government endorses the great bulk of the task force's 62 recommendations. Importantly, we have also decided on additional measures to assist small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Small business is the engine room of the Australian economy. Small business is an integral part of the decentralised network of family, workplaces and community which is the most effective guarantor of freedom and choice in our society. Small business is also a job creation machine. In the decade to 1994&hyphen;95, small business accounted for 1.1 million of the 1.2 million net jobs created over that period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to surveys undertaken for the Bell task force, half of all small business operators surveyed said that a significant reduction in compliance costs would allow more time to run the business and more than a quarter saw it as increasing profitability, with benefits for economic growth and jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our aim is to get governments at all levels off the back of small business. Small business should not be bogged down in paperwork and forced to deal with a multiplicity of overlapping regulatory bodies. Small business cannot afford excessive overheads and on&hyphen;costs. The overriding priority is to maximise time for business, which will generate economic growth and jobs for all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We promised small business a new deal at the last election and we are delivering on that commitment. Our macro&hyphen;economic policies are contributing to higher national savings and delivering low inflation, which have taken pressure off interest rates and delivered lower debt servicing costs to small business. We understand, however, that many small busi 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2692"> nesses are still doing it tough in the new, very competitive, low inflation environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We announced in the last budget capital gains tax rollover relief, which will encourage the expansion of small business. Another budgetary measure, the capital gains tax exemption on retirement, will provide a nest egg for small business owners who have been too busy ploughing all their capital back into the business to worry about superannuation. The provisional tax uplift factor has been reduced from eight per cent to six per cent at a cost to revenue of $180 million, improving the cash flow of small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have swept away Labor's jobs destroying unfair dismissal laws. Compulsory unionism has been abolished and a new, more flexible industrial relations framework established to encourage greater cooperation in workplaces.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Bureau of Statistics is reducing the burden of statistical collections on small business by 20 per cent. New regulations affecting business are subject to a sunset clause and we are reviewing existing business rules and regulations to abolish outdated ones.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our response to the Bell report builds on these achievements. The overall package involves reforms to business taxation and regulatory programs at a cost of over $600 million over four years. Our willingness to fund this package in the current budgetary circumstances is a reflection of the government's strong support for the small business sector. I now wish to outline some of the main measures.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Taxation</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dealing with our complex tax system was the number one compliance issue identified by small business in submissions to the Bell task force. The volume of tax legislation has become a tidal wave which threatens to overwhelm small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Few areas of taxation are more complicated than fringe benefits tax, FBT. There are around 55,000 small businesses that currently pay FBT, many of which pay relatively small amounts but incur substantial paperwork and compliance costs. We have, therefore, decided to abolish the FBT record keeping require 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment for businesses which provide less than $5,000 in taxable benefits in a base year and which maintain a similar level of benefit from year to year. FBT paid in subsequent years will be based on the base year liability. This will benefit up to half of all small FBT payers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Employers would be required to establish a new base year if they elect to have the amount of FBT varied down in later years or the benefits provided increased by more than 20 per cent above the base year. However, once they have established a new base year, they will again not be required to keep records as long as the taxable value of benefits does not materially alter thereafter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The FBT treatment of car parking will also be reformed. From 1 April 1997, car parking provided by small businesses on their premises will be completely exempt from fringe benefits tax. Certain provisions denying deductibility for self&hyphen;employed car parking will also be removed from 1 July 1997. All businesses will benefit from the extension of the FBT exemption for taxi travel to cover travel to and from the place of work at any time of the day or night.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will also liberalise capital gains tax rollover relief even further. It will now apply to the sale of shares in a small business. This will assist those small business owners who prefer to realise their interest by selling shares rather than the underlying assets of the business. This further liberalisation will increase the cost to revenue of the measure by about $90 million to around $300 million per annum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The capital gains tax exemption on the sale of a small business for retirement will now be extended to taxpayers who operate their small business through a private company or trust. This will increase the cost to revenue of this measure by about $35 million to an estimated $50 million per annum. These new capital gains tax provisions will apply from 1 July 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The use of asset registers for capital gains tax purposes will be allowed, eliminating the need for taxpayers to keep source documents after five years. Businesses will be better able to manage their cash flow through changes 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2693"> which will enable them to make voluntary tax payments at any time from 1 July 1997. The amount of time in which small companies and small instalment taxpayers can lodge their returns and pay liabilities will also be extended. The government has not accepted the task force's recommendation for changes to the wholesale sales tax system, which would have involved increasing taxes for a range of goods and taxpayers.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Unfair Dismissals</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Bell report recommended a review of the new unfair dismissal laws after 12 months. We support that recommendation but we have decided to go further in recognition of the particular difficulty small business has in dealing with complex industrial relations requirements and our concern to stimulate employment, particularly youth employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I announce today that businesses with 15 or fewer employees will be exempt from the federal unfair dismissal provisions for new employees until they have been continuously employed for a period of 12 months. This will apply whether they are full time or part time or on a regular casual basis. This will give small business every encouragement to hire new staff confidently, particularly younger, less experienced employees. Safeguards will remain. Small businesses will still be required to provide the statutory minimum period of notice on termination and to satisfy the provisions of the law preventing dismissal of employees on discriminatory grounds, such as pregnancy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will write to state Premiers to encourage them to adopt similar provisions in their jurisdictions. I hope all of them do so, and I warmly encourage those Premiers who have in recent months frequently asked the federal government to lift the burden of red tape on small business to replicate what I announce today in relation to unfair dismissals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission will be required to improve the system for parties in terms of when and where industrial matters, including unfair dismissals, are dealt with. This will be particularly relevant to small business.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA STYLE="Para">Regulation and Compliance Initiatives</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Small business cannot afford the time or expense of dealing with multiple regulatory authorities, including duplication by different tiers of government. The former Industry Commission found, for example, that the proprietor of a small hotel in one jurisdiction had to be familiar with 12 separate statutes and six codes of practice just to be sure of complying with state and Commonwealth occupational health and safety laws. Business regulation should be as efficient and streamlined as businesses demand of their own operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will therefore establish a single registration process for the Australian Taxation Office, the Securities Commission, the Bureau of Statistics and the Insurance and Superannuation Commission by July 1998. We will work with state and territory governments to develop a single point of entry for all levels of government through which business can obtain information on all government requirements and programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the next four years we will create a comprehensive national business information service&mdash;including a business regulation free&hyphen;call service&mdash;streamline business licensing and approvals processes and merge similar licences into single, `common' licences. These initiatives, which will cost around $23 million over the next four years, will result in considerable savings in compliance costs for small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The preparation of regulation impact statements for all Commonwealth regulation or legislation that has the potential to affect business will be mandatory. The costs and benefits of regulation will be weighed up carefully to ensure that the putative benefits are not outweighed by excessive economic and financial costs, including the compliance burden on business. The Assistant Treasurer will be given the authority to enforce these rules.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A tangible demonstration of the government's determination to avoid unnecessary additional increases in the regulatory burden on industry was our recent decision not to implement privacy legislation for the private sector at the Commonwealth level. I also 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2694"> raised the matter at last week's Premiers Conference. I have asked the Premiers and Chief Ministers not to introduce such legislation at the state level. Queensland and the Northern Territory have already agreed to our request and the other states will consider the Commonwealth's request further. I will write to the Premiers this week to set out my concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In cooperation with state and territory governments, the federal government will be accelerating processes to reform regulations in the areas of food, agricultural and veterinary chemicals, building codes, occupational health and safety, workers compensation and the environment. The former Industry Commission has estimated, for example, that savings of $350 million a year could be made from more efficient building regulations and a further $750 million from improved planning. Our reforms will reduce overlap and duplication, encourage greater national consistency and simplify processes. We will not be pursuing uniformity for its own sake. The aim is to achieve lower compliance costs for all businesses, both large and small.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Access to Finance</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government recognises that small business must have adequate access to finance if it is to grow and prosper. Apart from its reforms to capital gains tax and provisional tax, the government has made it easier for banks to invest equity capital in business by changing prudential guidelines on equity investments and making the tax treatment of equity investments in small and medium sized enterprises more attractive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have now decided to go further to encourage our small technology based firms. The high risks and long time horizons in the high technology sector justify targeted assistance. We are setting up a Small Business Innovation Fund, under which up to six early stage capital funds will be established to invest in more than 100 small high technology firms over five year. The Commonwealth will provide $130 million from the R&amp;D Start program and private sector fund managers will be responsible for finding matching private contributions on the basis of $1 of private capital for every $2 contributed by the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government. This will provide up to $200 million for investment in this growing sector over the next few years. This support will provide more jobs and exports in this important and growing area of the economy.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the election campaign we committed ourselves to the goal of reducing the burden of paperwork and red tape on small business by 50 per cent in our first term. I am confident that our response to the Bell report, along with other initiatives that we have already taken, will make a substantial contribution to that objective by the end of our first term. As evidence of our good faith, we are establishing objective performance indicators which can be used to measure our efforts by June 1999.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new package will require the ongoing commitment of governments at all levels and regular feedback from, and constructive dialogue with, small business. I appreciate the willingness already indicated by Premiers and Chief Ministers to cooperate on matters involving Commonwealth&hyphen;state regulation. I look forward, if I may say so again, to a speedy endorsement at a state level of the Commonwealth's initiatives in the area of unfair dismissal laws for small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We recognise that we can never meet all of the expectations of one sector of the community. We have kept faith with small business and we have gone much further in many areas than we promised before the election. We also know that the ongoing challenges which small business faces are immense and that our small business policies must be subject to a process of continuous improvement. That is why I pledge that my government will keep on listening to small business and acting on what we hear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the government's response to the Bell report to the House. I present the following paper:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If there was a huge audience of small business people here&mdash;there is not, of course, because they are out earning a quid&mdash;this speech by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) would not exactly be laying them in the aisles. If you were going to make any analytical point about this at all I suppose you could say that, in the course of the confabs that the government has had on this issue over the last few months and their delayed response to the Bell report, the Treasurer (Mr Costello) has defended his turf pretty well. The only announcements that the Prime Minister has had to make, at least in so far as they impact on the budget at all, are reannouncements of statements that they in effect already made on the capital gains tax. They are re&hyphen;badging what they have had to say about their R&amp;D fund, extracting a proportion of that and now saying that that is committed to small business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you contemplate the billions&mdash;and I will get on to this a bit later&mdash;that have been lost by small business through the changes that the government has put in place over the four&hyphen;year period&mdash;the R&amp;D tax concession elimination or reduction and the opportunities now forgone because of the changes to the export market development grants scheme&mdash;this does not exactly look like the sort of financing that small businesses, particularly those in the R&amp;D area who are the principal innovators in both our economy and our business sector, are looking for. And as for saying that election promises are kept&mdash;they are not kept. The most extraordinary feature of this is the fudging of all targets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are one or two subliminal elements of this which I suppose we on this side of the House can take a bit of belated credit for and enjoy. The low inflationary environment to which the Prime Minister referred is one of them. That is entirely a product of the administration of this country by the Australian 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Labor Party over the last five&hyphen; or six&hyphen;year period. But, as the Prime Minister also comprehends, this is not something which is regarded by small business with unmitigated joy. You do not go around the countryside hearing small business say to you, as you speak before them&mdash;even though you know it is in the interests of the economy overall&mdash;`Thank you so much for reducing the inflation rate. Thank you so much for putting that in place.' That does not feature in their conversations with either governments or oppositions. They have very mixed views about all that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What they do seek from government, however, is not an increased inflation rate, which would be an absurd thing for them to ask for, but a set of decisions which actually meet their real needs as opposed to what government thinks they ought to be worrying about. They look for governments getting off their backs somewhat, not promises of best endeavours and undertakings. That is the sort of thing they look for and, above all, they look for a level playing field being applied to them in relation to big business. Above all, they look for that&mdash;whether they happen to be franchisees, people who are renting from shopping centres or people running petrol stations who are in competition with vertically integrated operations in the shape of the petrol companies. This is the area of massive expansion of small business. Is there a darned thing in this which makes a dime of difference to one of them? Not one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister was inadvertently nice to us about one other thing. He pointed out that there have been 1.2 million net jobs&mdash;in fact, two million gross jobs&mdash;created over the last decade. What an extraordinary figure for him to put in place, that extraordinary great job growth that occurred entirely when the Labor Party was in office. He pointed out that the so&hyphen;called persecutors of small business in the Labor government of the day managed to preside over a situation where 90 per cent of the net jobs and 70 per cent of the gross jobs were created by small business under a Labor government&mdash;a job growth rate that operated at twice the level it did when the current Prime Minister was Treasurer.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2696">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You cannot exactly say that the objective evidence is out there that small business felt so persecuted during the period the Labor Party was in office that they could not do a thing&mdash;that they were hamstrung, hogtied and all the rest of it&mdash;when they had the biggest expansion of small business employment in Australia's history&mdash;and that was under the Labor government. They became the principal employers. During that period every employment program that we put in place, which in half&hyphen;baked ways you are trying to introduce, had small business at its centre.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We consulted small business on everything. We consulted members of area consultative committees which you started to abolish but then recreated&mdash;everybody from the business sector sitting on those area committees, and all of them small business people. When you go through all those job programs that provided support for employment, you see that every one of them was going into small business with employment opportunities being created in small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You come in here and say that exemption from the unfair dismissal law is a great concession to them. Don't you recollect when we put in place all those training places for young people? Remember, this is for young people and we were talking about a bit of reciprocal obligation with small business. We said that if they were in small business and putting in places that had an appropriate amount of training associated with them so young people being employed by small business were developing skills they could use for the rest of their lives, they were exempt from the unfair dismissal laws. They appreciated that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The situation they now confront is exactly the same because as we all know, as all business will tell you, behind their hands when they come up to you at meetings of big business&mdash;the Business Council, the ACCI or a bit of a mix between the two of them&mdash;or when you go to your area consultative committees, they say, `Leader of the Opposition, you do realise, don't you, that the unfair dismissal laws are exactly the same as they were when you were in office?' We say, `Yes, we do realise that. We do comprehend 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that.' They are exactly the same unfair dismissal laws, in effect, as when we were in office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a small roll back by the Treasurer on fringe benefits tax&mdash;and we welcome that. That is a sensible part of this proposition. But do not think that the huge numbers of small business people are going to suddenly dance in the streets for this and say, `Thank God.' This applies to six per cent of small business; 94 per cent are not involved. While that will be welcome for those six per cent, of course the other 94 per cent will just say, `Big deal,' and go on with the business they choose to go on with. That will be very fine for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But there are a couple of areas of small business which will not be at all pleased with this&mdash;that is, the fudging of the principal promises. The biggest fudging of a promise is this promise on reduction. It is so hard to get targets out of this government, but they got one. We have been trying to get targets for the jobless out of this government, without success&mdash;targets for putting people in this country in work, without success. They will commit themselves to nothing. The small business community can say hallelujah about one thing: until today they had secured from the government a target. The target was that they would get a 50 per cent reduction in small business&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="HARDGRAVE" NAMEID="CK6">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CK6">Mr Hardgrave</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You're the target.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The gentleman says that I am the target of all this. I am the target of the work for the dole scheme. I am the target of every conceivable position that your government brings out, old fellow. The only thing that matters to you is the polls. Decent government in this country does not matter to you at all. So I am the target of small business statements, I am the target of work for the dole, I am the target of every budget that you bring down because for some reason or other you have taken it into your head that the only thing you have to do is to govern in competition with me, not govern in the interests of the Australian people and develop some decent public policy. Yes, old son, I am the target. I am thoroughly well aware of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2697"> fact that I am the target as far as this piece of legislation is concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what has happened to this wonderful target? The Prime Minister says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As evidence of the government's good faith, we are establishing objective performance indicators which can be used to measure our efforts by June 1999.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">At least we got out of the Prime Minister enough of an inflection on this to actually clarify for us what is a very ambiguous statement. There are several ways of reading this. One is that you will get performance indicators by 1999; otherwise, you will get a set of tests against some performance indicators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But why are we establishing objective performance indicators? Because the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser), in answer to a question along those lines&mdash;not asked by us but I think by the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) on the backbench, his nemesis; there is a mutual obligation on the nemesis front between the two of them&mdash;said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have in place the benchmark to be able to give . . . the measurement of our achievement in this area.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Not `that we are establishing objective performance indicators' but `we have in place'. Is that 50 per cent? This which has allegedly been presented to the parliament as actually in place and operating now does not exist. They are now trying to develop those indicators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And what will they do? Will they give small business the capacity to test them against that 50 per cent red tape target that they put down? Will they give them a chance to test them before the next election? No, they will report in June 1999. Why report in June 1999? Why not report in June next year? Why not report in December next year? Why not report at the end of this year? Why not report in March next year&mdash;give it a 12&hyphen;month spread? Why not report after an 18&hyphen;month spread&mdash;as I said, in December next year? I think there is one reason, and it is pretty obvious to those of us in politics. It is the one date they can think of guaranteed to fall after the next election. That is the significance of that date. `Let us fudge that red tape thing 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> right out the back door, and let us come down with a report on all of this at a time after the next election comes around. We commit ourselves to nothing.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the one great target for small business, the one thing that they were prepared to commit themselves to while their `so&hyphen;calleds' point to the ground was that they would have 50 per cent of it removed, but there will be no objective tests. And, Mr Speaker, well might there not be because, when we look at the government's performance in terms of red tape in relation to small business as opposed to whether or not they have objective tests or anything else, we discover one or two things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wonder what small business felt about the burdens that were imposed on them to implement the family tax initiative which could have so easily been done through the child payment system but, for ideological reasons, they did not want to do? No, small business had to be drummed out&mdash;not the Taxation Office or Department of Social Security: small business was whacked out there. Their employees were told, `Get stuck into your boss; make sure your boss goes through all the paperwork; get that family tax initiative in place. Off you go; trundle away!' Their four hours go up to 4&half; or five, not down to two, as they go through that particular exercise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there is the other little bonzer one, the superannuation surcharge. There is an outside chance we might all come to understand what it means some time between now and Christmas. I have good news for you, team: we will pass this little doozey. We will give you an opportunity to be judged on this one. We will not do what Andrew Robb and all the rest of us and you desperately hope we will do&mdash;that is, knock this one off. No, you will wear this one, and you will explain it to small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And as for the best efforts of the member for Stirling (Mr Eoin Cameron) who has said he will vote against it, I have news for you, Eoin&mdash;they will come to nought. You will be standing in splendid isolation on all of this when this thing goes through. This will be a beaut little opportunity for you to work this one through your small business constituency and, as you put that surcharge in place, you will have an opportunity to explain to them 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2698"> what a fine job you have done on red tape as they go through the process of working that out. Red tape: red face.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then you have the diesel fuel rebate. What does the NFF say about that to those small business people who actually happen to be farmers or are in the agricultural industries? `Under the present bill,' says the NFF, `a farmer will have to keep a log book on every tractor.' That is a beaut little reduction in small business red tape, isn't it? That should really have them rocking in the aisles as they go through the opportunity to have a reduction in red tape when it comes to that little exercise!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there is their Start scheme for R&amp;D. This is a $120 million share of what was once a $1.2 billion tax concession. What do they do to get it? They get themselves stuck solidly into the red tape&mdash;not just signing off on their tax forms that they are claiming an R&amp;D concession in relation to it; they have to go through the process of developing their submissions to the board. So away they go as they try to get their R&amp;D tax concessions in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The simple fact of the matter is that we all know, as we have governed this country for a while&mdash;and you should know it by now too&mdash;that the one area of the private sector which is performing well on the R&amp;D front is the small business area. You do not actually get it out of big business. Many big businesses are in foreign hands. Their R&amp;D takes place in the mother country, and it comes out here maybe for a bit of Australian adjustment, but that is about the best of it. But the wonderful performance that we have put in place on software, the superb performance that has come about through Australian inventiveness&mdash;and day after day those inventions are announced&mdash;comes out of small business, or people about to be small businessmen. And what have they had? They have had themselves whacked over the back of the skull by a reduction in that concession from 150 per cent to 125 per cent, and they are supposed to dance in the aisles with thanks for the wonderful things that you have been doing with small business!</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will talk about one other area, and I do not have much time to conclude on it. There was one thing that small business went on their knees to this government for after the last election, and that was for the legislation that we have put in this House but which the government does not bring on&mdash;that is, for oppressive conduct. There is a simple reason why they will not do this. The biggest growth area for small business at the moment is the franchising area. It is growing at 14 per cent per annum. It is a $42 billion per annum industry. We set up a franchising code council to administer a voluntary franchising code of practice, and gave it funding for four years. It tried to amend the Trade Practices Act to underpin the code.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This code is about the oppression, potentially at least, of franchisors on the franchisees&mdash;in other words, the owners of the franchise on all the small business people. What happened with that? The council collapsed. The minister said the code could be policed by franchisors&mdash;well, that is pretty cool!&mdash;and the MTA says that this is like handing the umpire over to one side. And well they might. So this piece of potentially oppressive conduct goes straight out the window for the fastest growing area of small business. The burden is not off them, but the burden is on them&mdash;and all their protection is removed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More generally in small business, all those who are competing with vertically integrated big business companies&mdash;be they petrol station owners or people owning small fabrication operations trying to buy products off BHP, Comsteel and all the rest of them&mdash;all these outfits which absolutely require the effective operation of the Trade Practices Act to protect them from forms of oppressive action, have they received any comfort in these statements? Not one word. But this is what the head of the small business organisation described after the last election as their priority, the thing that they most wanted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what we have had here is re&hyphen;badging. What we have had here is not a bad initiative as far as capital gains tax is concerned, but a pretty solid defence by Treasury on the rest of it and a much worse position, net terms, for small business with all the other conces 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2699"> sions that have gone out the window. On top of all that, as a symbol of this, we have had the fudging of the one target they set themselves&mdash;the 50 per cent reduction in small tape. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">This motion is about providing biological insurance for children. Obviously, this insurance does not assist with the payment of bills. It is about storing a resource&mdash;a resource which was previously disposed of&mdash;as a lifesaving treatment for leukemia and other life threatening illnesses in children. The substance of this motion is about seeking to provide the infrastructure to store a resource that can give kids another chance when they would otherwise be facing death.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leukemia is a dreadful disease for anyone. It is even more distressing, though, when a child is fighting it. In my time in the media, I have been associated with Telethon and Appealathon in Perth, which raise money for children's health. As part of this, one is able to see the children our fundraising assists. To see young kids fighting these insidious diseases is just unfair. They do not deserve it 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and it defies logic that these young, innocent children can have their lives taken from them at such a young age because of these diseases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The least we can do when something comes forward which can be beneficial in helping these kids and save their lives is to encourage the development of the research, provide the necessary infrastructure to see the research to fruition and, if necessary, ensure the funding is in place to make sure the concept gets off the ground and remains in place so that something that can save lives is not left in the too&hyphen;hard basket or the too&hyphen;expensive basket.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Baby cord blood is one such item which cannot be left in the too&hyphen;hard or too&hyphen;expensive basket. Nor should the government not play any role in seeing this new development get off the ground. We have a responsibility to play a role so that we give those kids fighting diseases another chance or, at least, the very best chance possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Previously in treating leukemia, patients were, if the right match was found, given a bone marrow transplant. The problem with such transplants was that often a suitable match was unable to be found and the patient died whilst waiting for a suitable match. Research has found that the blood from the umbilical cord of newborn babies can be used in place of bone marrow. Cord blood is considered to be an exciting new resource in medicine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason cord blood is considered to be so valuable and important is that it contains stem cells. These are the building blocks of the blood and immune system and a vital component in the treatment of many life threatening diseases such as leukemia. Previously, the only form of treatment utilising stem cells has been with bone marrow, which has various problems even when a match is found.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, unlike umbilical cord blood, bone marrow treatment is said to be painful and invasive, it is expensive to collect and it is extremely difficult to match donors and recipients. What is more, patients who have had an umbilical cord blood transplant have a higher rate of survival, a better quality of life after the transplant and less frequent 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2700"> hospitalisation due to complications as compared with bone marrow transplants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 27 September last year, the then Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Family Services issued a media release following the opening of the first National Cord Blood Conference. He concluded by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1995 a seriously ill boy in Newcastle desperately required a bone marrow transplant but despite checking something like 3.5 million donors on worldwide registers there was no suitable donor to be found. Upon checking one cord blood bank, 10 possible donations were found and today, some 10 months later, that boy is well and has a much brighter future.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is but one example of many that I have heard of in the success of this new and exciting treatment. As this motion recognises, umbilical cord blood transplantation is an important and major development in fighting potentially fatal diseases like leukemia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously, the use of umbilical cord blood is still in its infancy. Nevertheless, the research conducted thus far and the results arising from the research and the actual use of the cord blood indicate the future use of it provides an exciting and optimistic future for its application in medicine, not just with children but also with adults. I am informed, for example, that the stem cells can also provide a match for the mother in treating a variety of diseases, including gynaecological and breast cancer. Currently, one of the developing areas in stem cell technology is the research into gene therapy to treat AIDS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This motion could perhaps have alluded to the progress in research for the application of cord blood in treating adults. I have been advised as follows by W. Beresford of Royal Perth Hospital:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Research is being undertaken to attempt to expand the number of stem cells in the cord blood by many laboratories (including RPH) so that the cord blood stem cell numbers could be increased in number sufficient to be effective in adults.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Dr Andrew Cumming, of the Princess Margaret Hospital for Children in Perth, has provided similar advice:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the available blood in one donation is only sufficient to provide treatment to paediatric patients or very small adults. There is, however, the poten 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tial in a few years time for the cells to be cultured and provide a possible therapy for adult patients.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is certainly a positive development and offers optimism for the future development of this area of medicine. Notwithstanding the benefits of cord blood, it should be remembered that it is also expensive to test, store and freeze. The advice I have received from Dr Cumming is that approximately $700 is needed for each cord blood to be tested, frozen and stored.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dr Cumming also mentioned that this does not include any follow&hyphen;up testing which may be required on the blood or the donor and that, in Western Australia for example&mdash;on present advice&mdash;a bank of 5,000 donations would be the minimum requirement, which translates to a cost of $3.5 million. Dr Cumming further advised that it was anticipated that it would take approximately four to five years to collect and store this amount of blood in Western Australia. I note that the government has already provided $200,000 in a grant to the Australian Cord Blood Bank to evaluate the importance of cord blood banks in Australia. This is something, I am sure, which would be welcomed by anyone interested in children's health, and I congratulate the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) for making the funding available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think the importance of blood banks is in question. What needs to be considered in any evaluation are the costs and feasibility of establishing cord blood banks across the country&mdash;whether it is necessary to have one in each state, to have them in selected states or just to utilise the Australian Cord Blood Bank. When it comes to searching for compatible donors, I am informed that, with searches being computerised, it should not be slower to find a compatible donor in another state or, for that matter, another country. Therefore, this poses, firstly, the question: is cord blood an appropriate medical resource&mdash;which I think it is&mdash;and, secondly, what is the feasibility of establishing cord banks in Australia, and where should they be established? Obviously, the costs and feasibility of establishing cord blood banks in each state and territory should be addressed&mdash;I have already mentioned the logistics of doing 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2701"> this in Western Australia. While I am not advocating these banks be established in all states and territories, we need to have a bank or banks established where they are available to treat all Australian children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have in Australia, that I know of, the Australian Cord Blood Bank. The Royal Melbourne Children's Hospital is raising money for such a bank and I note that there is a move in Western Australia to establish a bank involving the Red Cross blood transfusion service as the storer of frozen cord blood&mdash;the collection being through the obstetric services at King Edward Memorial Hospital. Decision makers at these hospitals will obviously be affected by whether any evaluation or investigation recommends one or a number of banks and by where the funding&mdash;if any&mdash;comes from, when they decide whether they maintain the bank or pool resources at just the one bank. In any evaluation, it is also necessary to look at where the recurrent funding will come from. While we all know that both the federal and state governments have limited funds, we need to look at how this will remain viable. More than likely, there would need to be some government involvement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, cord blood is landfill at rubbish tips at present, when&mdash;as we have proven here in Australia and overseas&mdash;it does have the potential to save lives. We need to look at protecting this resource with the same enthusiasm with which we seek to protect our natural resources in this great nation of ours.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to start by congratulating the member for Stirling (Mr Eoin Cameron) for bringing this motion before the House. I will admit ignorance of the detail of this issue until I saw the motion on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> . But, in the brief time that I have had to do a little research on the issue, I have found it a fascinating subject and something that, as the father of three children, I admit I have been somewhat remiss about myself: I recall that I cut the umbilical cord of my last child&mdash;if only I had realised what I was wasting in the process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The motion is timely&mdash;it is something that this parliament should debate&mdash;and it raises some important issues. We can all agree on one thing: the question of an umbilical cord blood bank is an issue of national importance and international significance. It ought to be progressed as effectively as it can be, although noting the issues that the member for Stirling mentioned around the question of feasibility and location, et cetera.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will kick&hyphen;off with a couple of paragraphs from a number of articles on this issue. One is in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">LAB News</EMPHASIS> of September 1995 and encapsulates some of the background to this subject:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First it was bottles and cans, then paper, now it seems blood could be the next resource to find a place as a recycled product. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2702">  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not your regular adult variety with its reactive properties, antibodies to past infections and possibly viruses, but the unsullied blood produced by a foetus in the womb and normally lost following birth when the placenta is discarded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Up to 250 mL of this valuable resource is contained within the placenta and umbilical cord after the baby is delivered. So called "cord blood" is rich in bone marrow stem cells, the precursors of various types of blood cells, and is ideal as a way to treat disorders in children such as leukaemia, thalassaemia, aplastic anaemia and a myriad of genetic diseases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Cord blood is also less reactive than the bone marrow used at present in the treatment of these conditions. Donor marrow contains lymphocytes that often look upon the patient's own blood and tissue as foreign. These donated cells attack this alien matter causing the severe and often fatal reaction graft&hyphen;versus&hyphen;host disease.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new Australian Cord Blood Bank at the Prince of Wales Children's Hospital in Sydney is the first organisation in this country to exploit the benign nature of cord blood in the management of critically ill children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bank, officially opened on June 19, will collect about 3000 donations over the next three years. This blood will be made available to physicians and scientists throughout the country and overseas for further research into the benefits of cord blood transplantation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many children with conditions affecting the bone marrow die for the lack of a substitute for bone marrow transplantation. This is where cord blood can have greatest impact. "In Australia, 40 to 50 children each year are likely to benefit from cord blood transplants," said paediatric oncologist Professor Marcus Vowels, co&hyphen;director of the fledgling bank. "As many as 25 of these will be patients with leukaemia who don't have suitable donors."</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The non&hyphen;invasive nature and safety of cord blood donations should encourage mothers to agree to the blood being collected. They will be given all relevant information about cord blood and its uses and be asked to sign a consent form. In cases where mothers wish to take the placenta home with the child for cultural reasons, it may be possible to extract the cord blood and then return the placenta to meet the mother's cultural needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although cord blood is less reactive than bone marrow and does not need to be perfectly matched to the recipient, donations from all cultural groups will be necessary to provide a comprehensive bank with blood types 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> suitable for all children with bone marrow disorders. Professor Vowels said that it is very likely in the future that all mothers would be prepared to donate cord blood. This is a resource with a tremendous potential for children with diseases affecting the bone marrow, so we should make the most of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first cord blood transplant was performed in 1988 in Paris, France. The patient was a five&hyphen;year old boy with Fanconi anaemia who is alive and disease free today. Since then, cord blood transplants have been successfully performed on patients with acute lymphocytic leukaemia, acute myelocytic leukaemia, nueroblastoma, juvenile chronic myelogenous leukaemia and a range of other diseases that I am afraid I am incapable of pronouncing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although early cord blood transplants involved only sibling donors and recipients, 90 transplants were performed between August 1993 and November 1995 using cord blood from an unrelated donor. In most cases, the cord blood donors and transplant recipients were not HLA matched&mdash;that is, proteins on the surface of white blood cells, HLA antigens, that play an important role in transplantation were not identical. Despite the mismatch, the transplants have been successful. Some of that information is from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">BMT Newsletter</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To put this in the context of the personal I would like to quote from an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> regarding the launch of the Cord Blood Bank. It states:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, of the 180 children in Australia and New Zealand diagnosed every year with leukaemia, about 30 children were left with no option after not responding to drug therapy and unable to receive a bone marrow transplant.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I have quoted extensively because this issue is quite technical in nature and does require the wording of others on some occasions to actually encapsulate the information in the time that I have. But certainly what we do have here is a tremendous opportunity and something that should be supported by both sides of the chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also congratulate the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) for the government's initiative of some $200,000 last year to help kick off the funding required. My understanding is that something like $500,000 is required to get this bank up and running. I am unaware of the detail in terms of where fundraising is at at this stage, but I certainly hope it is an initiative that all Australians get behind. There is nothing like the death of a child and the possibility of saving that child from death as an initiative that we see as positive for our future. As I understand it, the proposed cost of this in the Australian context will be negligible. This contrasts with the cost, prior to the setting up of the bank, of something in the region of $28,000 per person to arrange for the importation of the necessary material from the United States.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I mentioned earlier, one of the advantages of this particular type of transplant is that at the moment with bone marrow the circumstances are&mdash;and I am no technical expert, but I will ramble on a bit&mdash;that there are something like six components of bone marrow which are required for a match. For bone marrow to be transplanted a six&hyphen;six match is required in terms of the bone marrow compo 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> nents. The situation with cord blood is that, because it is newer and has not developed all the various biases and viruses that our bodies develop over time and we develop over time, it has a certain naivety which makes it of much greater significance. On that basis, there have been successful matches with cord blood where only three in six of the components have been required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This therefore means that somewhere in the region of maybe only 100 cord blood samples should be required to get a match for any one individual. That is great news for people with children who are suffering from this type of disease. It gives them a real chance at life. The other thing I was interested to find out is that the stem cells, even though they are injected into a vein, which is the normal process, head straight for the bone marrow. So they are quite clever in that respect; they know where they live.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The situation the last I had heard was that there had been three cord blood transplants in Sydney&mdash;two within families and one unrelated&mdash;and they had all been successful. The condition has a capacity to be expanded in terms of a range of different types of gene therapy. This means we are really seeing the commencement of a form of medical revolution which can relate to seriously improving the chances for our children to live longer lives. I congratulate all those involved with the motion. I think it sets out a process for the future in terms of proceeding with this and I commend it to the House. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to support the motion on the benefits of baby cord blood standing in the name of the member for Stirling (Mr Eoin Cameron). In doing so I add my support to the concept of setting up an inquiry to determine the suitability of using baby cord blood in helping to save lives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A brief look at the history of this subject tells us, as the honourable member for Bruce (Mr Griffin) has also already suggested, that the first successful human cord blood transplant took place in France in 1988 on a child with Fanconi anaemia. It was in France again, in 1991, where another successful transplant 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2704"> was performed on a child with chronic myelogenous leukaemia. Since that first operation in 1988, there has been the development of cord blood banks both in the United States and in a number of European countries. These banks are linked with each other not only to enhance the matching process but also to facilitate an ongoing exchange of dialogue and information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Closer to home in Australia, I understand that some 500 collections are now stored in Sydney. It was here that a cord blood transplant program was established some four to five years ago at the Sydney Children's Hospital under Professor Marcus Vales. Closer still, in my home state of Western Australia, one cord blood transplant has taken place at Princess Margaret Hospital. As a nurse I have cared for many children with leukaemia and I do indeed welcome any breakthrough that will save these kids' lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When arguing for or against the merits of using cord blood there are different schools of thought. Many clinicians and researchers, for obvious reasons, take a cautious approach and, generally, I would agree with this. They readily acknowledge the benefits of cord blood transplants in cases involving related donors and recipients, such as family members. But they have doubts about the value of cord blood, within the limits of current clinical knowledge, where the donor and recipients are unrelated. Some also hold the view that there is little benefit from a proliferation of cord blood banks throughout Australia. Many great benefits can be derived from the use of cord blood, but we should advance these in conjunction with correct clinical knowledge and practice, not development in advance of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me briefly outline the possible advantages of cord blood use. Human cord blood is a valuable source of stem cells which normally exist in the bone marrow. These stem cells generate the functional cells of the blood and immune systems. Cord blood can thus be seen as an alternative to the use of bone marrow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The process of retrieval of bone marrow is invasive. It is painful and it may often require a general anaesthetic. However, cord blood is obtained without risk or pain and uses a by&hyphen; 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">product of the birth process which is normally discarded. Another advantage of cord blood is that it can be stored for a number of years and that its collecting and storing is logistically easy. It has been argued that there may be less risk in cord blood transplants of infectious disease transplantations, such as HIV and other viral diseases. It has also been suggested that there may be fewer side effects from cord blood transplants, especially in relation to graft versus host disease. However, some people claim that the conditioning regime and drug programs for cord blood transplants between unrelated donor and patients are very similar.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The range of uses for cord blood is wide, including treatment of both malignant and non-malignant diseases. Time does not allow me to mention them all, but many members will be familiar with the traumatic effects that diseases such as multiple myeloma, lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, neuroblastoma, acute lymphocytic leukemia, aplastic anaemia, Fanconi's anaemia, Hunter's syndrome and, most importantly, osteoporosis, have on people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that one of the most exciting developing areas in stem cell technology is the research into gene therapy, which was alluded to by the member opposite, to treat people who are infected with the AIDS virus. Cord blood also shows promise for the treatment of metastatic cancer and in molecular medicine, whereby defective genes are replaced with functional genes for diseases such as sickle cell anaemia, haemophilia and many others. In summing up the advantages of cord blood, let me quote Mr John Wagner, who is the Director of the cord blood transplant program at the University of Minnesota Hospitals and Clinic in the USA:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Collecting cord blood poses no risks or discomfort for the donor. Moreover cord blood is rarely contaminated by viruses such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) or Epstein&hyphen;Barr (EBV) that can cause serious problems for the transplant patient.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>  journalist Alan Ramsey, in his article in that paper's Saturday edition, devoted some time to talking about priorities in this place and the fact that the perception in the community that sometimes our priorities are misguided does not do much for the perception amongst those people of politicians. I think it is fair to say that it is motions such as this, which of course has attracted bipartisan support today, that I think help to lift that standard, at least in the eyes of the Australian community. I congratulate the member for Stirling (Mr Eoin Cameron) for putting forward the motion, one which I am happy to speak to and to lend my support to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The umbilical cord blood bank infrastructure which the member for Stirling seeks to have established would capitalise on one of the marvels of nature and would expand on the very good work already being done by those at the Australian Cord Blood Bank which, along with the work done at the Sydney Children's Hospital, has already provided a number of young children with another chance at life. I do not think that there could be an issue before the parliament any more important than that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new science has enormous advantages over the traditional method of replenishing stem cells, which many members have made reference to. It is not necessary for me to go over it again now other than to say that those stem cells are attacked by the very treatment that doctors prescribe for the leukaemia and other diseases. The decimation of those cells is an unfortunate implication of those treatments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a father of three young children, I often wonder how strong I would be if I were called upon to deliver one of my own children for chemotherapy or some other similar treatment if they were to become ill with one of those devastating diseases. How difficult it would be to attempt to explain to a child so young that he or she is being regularly presented for this treatment for his or her own good. I think it would be absolutely one of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the worst nightmares for a parent of a child of any age. It would be exacerbated considerably if, at the end of all that, there were some complication with stem cells and if, as a result of a lack of government commitment, the child were not able to access that new technology. I think that would be very sad indeed and a most traumatic situation for any family or any parent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not talking today about doubt about the long&hyphen;term success of the procedure. We are not talking about doubt about the commitment of health professionals working in the area. We are simply talking about the doubt of governments' commitment to the funding of this new technology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is fair to say that the motion of the government member for Stirling (Mr Eoin Cameron) does recognise that the government has made some commitment in its $200,000 announcement last year&mdash;something I would also like to take the opportunity to recognise and to support&mdash;but the commitment is less than is necessary to ensure that all Australians, and in particular young Australians, are afforded the opportunity to access this very important new technology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The House does not have to take my word for that. One needs only to listen to a tape or read a transcript of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Science Program</EMPHASIS> of 3 February on Radio National last year. On it, the coordinator of the Australian Cord Blood Bank, Kerrie Carlton, made it quite clear that the major hurdle facing her team and all those involved in the industry, if I can call it that, is the question of funding. It would be a tragic shame if even one child in this country was denied a second chance because of a lack of commitment on the part of this or any other government, be it federal or state.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> notes its concern at the greater responsibilities and increasing stress being placed on teachers because of many social factors, including the disintegration of many of Australia's families and resulting lack of discipline within the school environment; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> recommends that more authority be given to teachers so that teachers and their students are not placed in danger and teachers can get on with the job of educating those students who wish to be taught.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The motion put forward today expressing support for Australia's teachers and citing the reasons, which should be self&hyphen;evident, for the need for that support is an extremely important matter for the future wellbeing of our nation. Unfortunately, in the short time I have I can only just brush the surface of the subject, which is very complex and touches on a very broad area of human behaviour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that we live in a time of great change, and probably one of the greatest changes taking place is within our family structures and is being caused by dysfunctional families and family breakdown. There is enormous vulnerability in the family today and, while many argue that children are not affected by parental divorce or separation, statistics tell a different story, particularly in relation to discipline, psychological difficulties and health related problems. This becomes even more acute when the single parent is unemployed. Australian Bureau of Statistics figures reveal the number of sole parents with dependent children has grown from 173,700 in 1975 to a massive 463,800&mdash;nearly half a million&mdash;in June 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has also been a change in the way people live and react to one another. It is argued that competition and consumerism have replaced humanistic and more social societal forms such as the family and religion. Many informal support mechanisms no longer exist and individuals are becoming more isolated in their local communities. The fear of not having the skills to compete or live up 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to the perceived standards of others causes alienation for many people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are not the only causes of disciplinary problems being faced by educators but are a few of the many. Throughout the community, many parents feel they are unable to exert appropriate discipline on their children because of their personal situation or intervention from one source or another or, for many reasons, they simply refuse to exert discipline. As a result, there is now tremendous pressure being placed on our teaching system, which expects teachers to be not only the educators but also most of what a parent should be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> As we would all be aware, this is particularly so in the nation's secondary schools. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training stated in their report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sticks and stones</EMPHASIS> that teachers are reporting that junior primary students and girls are now more likely to involved in antisocial behaviour. I recall a primary school I visited having a student sit on the roof of the school for the whole day with no&hyphen;one being able to entice him down. I am aware of another teacher who was assaulted by students in her class. She was told her services were no longer required in the short term while the students received counselling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report says that some teachers link violent and antisocial behaviour with poor academic achievement and low self&hyphen;esteem. The teachers believe that students exhibiting inappropriate behaviour have low self&hyphen;esteem as a result of low literacy and academic achievement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee's previous reports&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Literacy needs and the workplace</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The literacy challenge</EMPHASIS>&mdash;identified respectively that more than one million Australians were illiterate, about 35 per cent of whom were native English speakers, and between 10 and 30 per cent of children finished primary school with literacy problems. The students at risk component of the national equity program administered by DEETYA funded a project in 1993 for at risk students which addressed illiteracy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The funding proposal stated that illiteracy is often one of the root causes of many other problems such as homeless children, teenage 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2707"> suicide, violence and young offenders against the law. The ability to read and write is so tied up with the child's self&hyphen;esteem and confidence that people who work in the field see these problems starting to emerge as early as infant school and escalating as they approach the high school years. That is one reason why, after decades of experimentation by social engineers, I welcome the federal government's moves, in partnership with the states, to test for literacy and numeracy skills and to direct additional financial resources to ensuring all Australian students are competent in these skills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The majority of evidence suggests that inappropriate behaviour is identifiable in children as early as preschool and kindergarten. Changing a child's behaviour patterns after the age of eight requires significantly more resourcing with reduced chances of success than if the problem is addressed in the earliest schooling years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given the ever increasing number of dysfunctional families in Australia, one can seen how difficult this situation becomes. If a child is not guided in the right direction at an early age, that student, right through his or her student life, can make things extremely difficult for themselves, their fellow students and certainly for the teacher, where the buck always seems to stop. In recent times of great unemployment, many students who would normally have obtained work after year 10 have continued to stay at school, especially with the implementation of Austudy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Austudy, while well intentioned and certainly needed, has encouraged a number of poorly motivated students to remain at school because attendance is the only criteria for payment. I recall a teacher telling me of one such student whose great trick to impress the crowd was breaking the legs off plastic chairs at the back of the classroom.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on a matter of importance to the ex&hyphen;service men and women of Australia. Veterans entitled to a war service loan under the defence service home scheme are one group in the community not to have benefited from the drop in home loan interest rates. When interest rates some years ago were high, the interest payable on war service loans was set at a rate much lower than the going variable rate. But, as the variable rate has dropped, the rate on war service loans has remained virtually static. There is now little difference between the variable rate available to the general public and the rate which is payable on the defence service loan&mdash;which currently stands at 6.85 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given the special contribution of veterans to this country, I believe veterans deserve better. The rate on war service loans should be set at a certain number of percentage points below the general rate in order that it reflect that special service. Alternatively, veterans should also be given the opportunity to cash out their loans so that they can put the cash towards home maintenance or home improvements. Many veterans may find this much more beneficial than continuing with the loans&mdash;even at a lower rate. They should be given a choice between continuing with a loan at an interest rate pegged a few percentage points below the going rate, or cash.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cost to the government would not be great. The maximum loan is $25,000 and the cost, at current rates, is probably about $10,000 to $12,000 over the life of the loan. Pegging the interest rate for war service loans a few points below the variable rate and offering veterans the chance to cash out the benefit would ensure that veterans are treated with the respect they deserve. I urge the government to act on this proposal.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="2707"><TITLE>Australian Public Service: Experiential Training</TITLE>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2708"> who works at ANSTO, the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, brought to my attention an internal memorandum dated 5 February 1997 advising of `an integrated program of team building beginning by using experiential learning techniques at Silver Wattle', which is a training facility at Bungendore, New South Wales, near Canberra. The memorandum states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Silver Wattle experience is fast becoming part of the folklore of ANSTO and we are now rolling out the program to leaders across ANSTO.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of some concern to me is the fact that the convenor of the Silver Wattle experience is Peter Ring, who himself attributed the success of Silver Wattle to the influence of Ken Dyers, the leader of an organisation known as Kenja, which portrays itself as a provider of personal development courses but which I would describe unequivocally as a cult whose leader claims that his method can free people from their `inner repressed psychological blocks'.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> (Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="2708"><TITLE>Blacktown Senior Citizens</TITLE>

This is a result of the New South Wales Labor government continuing to break the agreed regional forests agreement process. The problem is that the New South Wales 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Labor government has found that it cannot keep its contractual responsibilities and is having difficulty providing resource.

You had 13 years in government, you left the small businesses of Australia drowning in a sea of regulation and unreasonable industrial relations restrictions, and you have the nerve to go on a radio interview and say that it is too little, too late.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a fact that during the election campaign the coalition parties made a number of very important commitments to the small business sector. I am very proud to say, as leader of this government, that we have not only honoured those commitments but in many areas surpassed those commitments. We have delivered more than we promised in the area of capital gains tax. We have delivered more than we promised in some of the areas of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> industrial relations. We have delivered more than we promised in a number of other areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I particularly remind the parliament that the capital gains tax rollover relief represents the most generous taxation incentive for small business any government has delivered in Australia since the early 1960s. It will mean that, effectively, any small business operating in Australia can sell a small business and invest up to $5 million of the proceeds of the sale of that business into not just a business of a like kind but a business of any kind and defer the capital gains tax liability. We have also made the details of the retirement concession, which is in relation to up to $500,000 of the proceeds of the sale of a business when the former owner of that business goes into retirement, infinitely more generous than was originally promised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have extended the relief to small business in the area of unfair dismissals. As a result of the announcement I made today, any firm employing fewer than 15 people will effectively be able to apply a probationary period of one year for any new employee, whether full time, part time or casual. What that means is that, if it is not working out, you can let the unsatisfactory employee go without landing up in court and having your business go broke as a result of ridiculous litigation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He does not know. Kim gave it a tick; your leader gave it a tick. What this means in reality is that we have ushered in a new era of commonsense so far as the employee/employer relationship is concerned. It only stands to reason that, if you are going to take on a new employee, they should have a probationary period of 12 months. If it does not work, you ought to be able to let that employee go without the threat of court 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2713"> proceedings. But you should not be able to let that employee go if it is because of discrimination based on their race, gender or some other kind. And of course you must always, as we will insist, pay that person the stipulat ed rate in the Australian workplace agreement and also observe the statutory period of notice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are giving more generous tax concessions. We are introducing more intelligent industrial relations laws. We are introducing more workable unfair dismissal laws. With our macro-economic policies, we are taking the pressure off interest rates. There has been a reduction of 1&half; per cent in official interest rates since this government came to power. We have announced new incentives for high technology small businesses, which over a period of time will encourage their growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you take all of these things into account you have a very intelligent, well targeted package. You have a package which is designed to tackle the things that small business complains about. It is a package that vindicates the faith of small business in the coalition. It is a package that more than delivers on the commitments I made on behalf of the coalition in the election campaign. It is a package which demonstrates that, when it comes to small business, the only two parties in this parliament that are really interested in them are the Liberal and National parties.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK></QWN>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CT4">Mr COSTELLO</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. The announcement by the Prime Minister in relation to small business is one of those announcements which will be welcomed by small business throughout the country. This was a statement which was made by the government because the government was determined to reduce the paperwork compliance business of small business in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As announced by the Prime Minister today, the government will be introducing an exemption from fringe benefits tax record keeping where an employer in a base year has $5,000 or less in taxable benefits. What that means is that if somebody has, in the past year, had $5,000 or less of taxable benefits, they are absolved from keeping their fringe benefits tax records. In relation to those benefits, they pay the tax that was assessed in relation to that and continue on without any requirement to keep records whatsoever, unless there is an unusual year and a variation by 20 per cent. If any small business believes that assessing the tax at the level in the base year would be unfair, they can keep records and have it varied down and establish a new base in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This announcement in itself has the capacity to exempt about half the small businesses that are currently paying fringe benefits tax from record keeping requirements. One of the things that came back to the government, as 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2715"> a result of the Small Business Deregulation Task Force report, is that it was not so much the level of the taxation that was payable, but it was the compliance cost of keeping the records and having that level assessed that was really worrying small business. This government is proud that it has been able to have a major breakthrough in relation to record keeping of fringe benefits taxes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to that, this government has taken significant steps forward in two other areas. First of all, the government has announced that, for small businesses that provide car parking on their business premises, there will no longer be fringe benefits tax payable. The fringe benefits tax on parking was one of the most complicated to administer and in revenue terms not significant at all. We have cut through the red tape and have exempted that whole area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, the government has announced new measures in relation to taxi travel which will extend the fringe benefits tax exemption for employee taxi travel to cover travel to and from work at any time of the day. It will not be necessary, as it was in the past, to prescribe hours during which fringe benefits tax would apply. This is a benefit, in relation to travel to and from work, from fringe benefits tax, whatever the hours are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is pleased that it has been able to cut through the red tape of fringe benefits tax on car parking, cut through the red tape of fringe benefits tax on taxi travel, and cut through the red tape for small businesses providing benefits of less than $5,000. It was long overdue and the coalition government is proud to deliver it.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

We know the Labor front bench has said the Leader of the Opposition has got to get more aggressive in question time. I am going to finish the answer. The answer is that in 1995 this was put down as a measure in relation to the budget because the Labor Party had not delivered on  a 1992 law.

What measures is the government taking to make it easier for small business to employ people while at the same time maintaining sensible safeguards for employees?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="2717" SPEAKER="Reith, Peter, MP" NAMEID="WI4" ELECTORATE="Flinders" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Industrial Relations; Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Wide Bay for his question. This government is unashamedly pro small business. The reason we have brought down the statement today is to give some encouragement and institute some practical, sensible measures to help small business. In the area of unfair dismissal, only my predecessor could have invented a solution to a problem that did not exist before he arrived, which is why we have had the tremendous problems we have had with unfair dismissal. That is why, when we drafted the legislation on the Workplace Relations Act, we made provision for reasonable exemptions, and particularly exemptions that related to small business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have announced today is in conformity with the legislation. We intend to bring down a regulation that says a small business with 15 employees or less will not be subject to the unfair dismissal provisions in respect of new employees in their first 12 months. I think the response of the small business community will be that they will have greater confidence that they can go ahead and give people the chance of a job&mdash;which hopefully most Australians, apart from the Labor Party, would actually like to see.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is, if you are running a small business&mdash;as even the international conventions show&mdash;you do not have a human resources department and you do not have lawyers on tap at great expense to defend claims of this sort. What you need is a practical, user&hyphen;friendly system that will encourage small business to give people jobs. It is an innovative step for Australia, and an important and useful one, but I would have to say when you look around the world you will see we are not alone in introducing such exemptions.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2718">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Speaker, I am also pleased to say that the regulations contain other exemptions. For example, we have exemptions in respect of short&hyphen;term casuals up to 12 months; we have exemptions in respect of trainees under the national training wage and under the modern apprenticeship training scheme; we have clarified the situation in respect of probationary periods up to three months for people taking on new employees; and we have a better regime in respect of fixed term contracts. All of this is aimed at one particular objective&mdash;that is, to give our businesses, and particularly our small businesses, some real encouragement to give people the opportunity of a job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Interestingly enough, those regulations were the subject of discussions between the government and the Australian Democrats last night. We have come to a sensible position on those regulations, so your notice of disallowance in the Senate will get knocked off. I will tell you why it should. It is for no other reason than this: one of the things you wanted to do was knock off the $50 application fee for lodging an unfair dismissal. Instead of saying to employers and employees, `We are going to have a fair system', the message you want to send to small business and to employees is that it is just an easy system that you can go in and knock off an employer regardless of the circumstances of the dismissal. It really shows your true colours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When it comes to small business, quite frankly, you walked away from them for 13 years, and you have the hide&mdash;even in opposition&mdash;to attempt to knock off the very sensible measures that we have introduced to help small business. This is a fair deal. It retains the unlawful discriminatory provisions which protect employees, so if you are dismissed on the grounds of race, colour, sex, pregnancy, disability, union membership&mdash;and even non&hyphen;union membership&mdash;those safeguards are still in place. It is a fair deal for employees. It gives them the chance of a job.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

I am pleased to be able to provide the House with further information on the establishment of the small business innovation fund, announced in the statement. It is a significant new measure to assist small technology based companies. It has never been attempted in this country before and it addresses a major problem that the opposition did not have the vision to overcome.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As small business knows only too well, one of the greatest challenges they face is getting access to start&hyphen;up capital. It is the small technology sector in particular which has found this challenge the hardest to overcome. That is why this government acted to provide improved access to early stage capital for selected small businesses. This fund will provide a pool of around $200 million to enable small technology firms to develop their ideas, similar to the highly successful programs in the United States and Israel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will provide $130 million on a two-for-one matching basis with private sector capital. The management of the fund will rest with the private sector. Investment decisions will be made by the private sector fund managers under the guidelines set by the Industry Research and Development Board. Importantly, I expect the capital funds will invest in more than 100 small technology firms over the next five years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The small business innovation fund represents the most significant opportunity the Australian technology sector has ever had to access capital.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. I refer to the government's commitment to helping young unemployed Australians overcome the disadvantages they face in gaining employment. Given the fact that the opportunity to undertake apprenticeships and training inevitably enhances the chances of young Australians to obtain permanent employment, I ask the minister how the government proposes to encourage small business to take on more apprenticeships and trainees.</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Stirling for his question. Certainly one of the most encouraging features of the small business scene at the moment has been the response of the small business sector to the government's efforts to encourage the increasing take&hyphen;up of apprenticeships and traineeships. The government has strongly promoted apprenticeships and traineeships in the fulfil 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2722"> ment of its commitment to provide young Australians with expanded quality training opportunities. Of course, these training opportunities are to the advantage of small businesses, because they improve the bottom line, as well as to the trainee. Last year we established an initiative in 10 regions of Australia with the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and Nettforce group training companies to promote traineeships. I am very pleased to say that, in the year to date, 1996&hyphen;97, traineeships are up 68 per cent over the previous year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is, however, aware that the complexity of the training system which has been left in place by the previous government still requires significant reform. The government is taking a number of actions to simplify the training arrangements. Of course, all  members of this House would be aware that, in 1995, the number of young people in apprenticeships and traineeships as a proportion of the work force was the lowest for three decades. You had 10 years to get apprenticeships up and you could not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is taking a number of steps to simplify access to quality training for small businesses. I have already announced the establishment of some 19 one&hyphen;stop apprenticeship shops, which will cut through the red tape and end wasteful duplication between levels of government. Later this year, the government will be contracting out the services provided by government for entry level training, recognising the very broad interests and the capabilities which now exist in the broader market to promote the take&hyphen;up of quality training opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Coming through in the second half of this year will be a range of new, flexible apprenticeship and training opportunities made possible by new national training packages and by the new industrial relations legislation. The government is currently working on a model training agreement under the industrial relations reforms so that training arrangements will be readily accessible by small business and by trainees at minimum training wage levels.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the new national apprenticeship system, qualifications will be recognised throughout Australia, training providers in one state will be recognised in all states and training will be able to be customised to the needs of business. These are the training reforms which Australia has been waiting for for 13 years, which the previous government failed to introduce, which small business desperately needs and wants and which young unemployed people desperately need and want. This government is delivering on its promises and the benefits will flow through, in expanded real job opportunities, to young Australians.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I really have to say that you can understand people thinking that the Leader of the Opposition is less inflexible given the flip&hyphen;flops on policies that we have been having from the Labor Party in the last three months. I am not aware of any announcement that was made by the government on Friday that would effect waiting lists. Waiting lists will be affected over the next 15 years by a number of factors. They are demographic factors, epidemiological factors and the cost and structure of services. For the demographic factors, we have increased utilisation of hospitals by older people, we have an ageing population as such with the number of people over 65 doubling by the year 2021 and the number of people over 80 going to go up four times by the year 2021.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of epidemiology, we have a greater shift to chronic illness. Between 1991 and 1994 chronic illnesses went up from 71 per cent of all admissions to 77 per cent of all admissions. We have new illness like Hepati 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tis C which will place an enormous burden on our hospital system over the next 15 years. With costs and structure of services, we have increased services such as cardiac surgery, which went up 40 per cent, I think, over the last five years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are going to add together to place increased pressures on services. What the government is going to attempt to do is use the next Medicare agreement to institute some reform that will give us a capacity to deal with this. The reforms are sensible, such as increased day surgery, better step down facilities and better community care. We may not succeed, but at least we are going to try.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All the last Medicare agreement was was a bribe to get the states on board before the 1993 election. You instituted no reform. You threw extra money at it. The states pulled money out and the net effect was nothing. You have a crisis in every state in Australia due to your inability to get any long-term reform.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The national small business summit that I held in June of last year started the working relationship between the states in the area of red tape and compliance and our commitment towards that area. I am pleased to announce that the existing Commonwealth&hyphen;state reform process will be accelerated. Substantial reforms have already been achieved in the building sector. For example, a new national certification scheme for building products took effect from 1 January this year. In the case of the ground&hyphen;breaking initiative on the single entry point for service, state and territory ministers have already agreed to work towards comprehensive service across all levels of government.

With these reforms small business will benefit from a streamlining of government regulations, greater access to regulatory information and the capacity to have heard their complaints about the demands of regulation.

The arrangements provide for the Commonwealth to meet half of all state and territory outlays incurred in providing personal hardship and distress payments where the states' or territories' expenditure exceeds the small disaster threshold of $200,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of non&hyphen;personal hardship and distress measures, Commonwealth assistance is provided on a dollar for dollar basis, above an assessed financial threshold, and increases to $3 for every dollar outlaid by the states and territories where the states' and territories' expenditure exceeds 1.75 times the state or territory threshold.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the question of the monitoring of natural disasters, as pointed out earlier, the primary responsibility for emergency relief lies with the state and territory governments. Again, however, requests for practical Commonwealth assistance with disasters are passed to the emergency management authority by an  authorised official in each state. The EMA coordinates such assistance and remains in close contact with state emergency services organisations and state and federal governments. The EMA operates under the direction of the Minister for Defence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This weekend's cyclone damage in far north Queensland is the fourth natural disaster to strike Queensland this financial year. Queensland's current funding threshold is $27.34 million, and expenditure for disaster relief has exceeded 1.7 times that threshold this year. As a result, current relief from the Commonwealth for Cyclone Justin damage&mdash;when assessed&mdash;will be reimbursed by the Commonwealth to the Queensland government at the rate of $3 for each dollar outlaid.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the Senate the fact that members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960 are the only Australians to be deliberately excluded from eligibility for repatriation benefits in the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (the Act) for honourable `active service'. Australian Archives records show that the only reason for the exclusion was to save money. Members of the Australian Army and Air Force serving in Malaya were not excluded, and the costs associated with the land forces was one of the main reasons for the exclusion of the Navy. An 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2730"> injustice was done which later events have compounded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are two forms of benefits for ex&hyphen;servicemen, Disability Pensions for war caused disabilities (denied the sailors referred to but introduced in 1972 for `Defence Service' within Australia) and Service Pensions. Allied veterans of 55 nations involved in conflicts with Australian forces until the end of the Vietnam War can have qualifying eligibility for Service Pensions under the Act. Service by 5 countries in Vietnam was recognised after RAN service in Malaya was excluded. The Department of Veterans' Affairs confirms that 686 ex&hyphen;members of the South Vietnamese Armed Forces are in receipt of Australian Service Pensions; 571 on married rate and 115 on single rate. In effect, 1,257 Service Pensions, denied to ex&hyphen;members of the RAN, are being paid for serving alongside Australians in Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is claimed that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) Naval personnel were engaged on operational duties that applied to all other Australian service personnel serving overseas on `active service'. They bombarded enemy positions in Malaya and secretly intercepted enemy communications;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Naval personnel were subject to similar dangers as all other Australian service personnel serving in Malaya and there were RAN casualties, none of which appear on the Roll of Honour at the Australian War Memorial;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) the Royal Australian Navy was `allotted' for operational service from 1st July 1955 and this is documented in Navy Office Minute No. 011448 of 11 November 1955, signed by the Secretary to the Department of the Navy. The RAN was then apparently `unallotted' secretly to enable the excluding legislation to be introduced;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) the Department of Veterans' Affairs has said it can find no written reason(s) for the RAN exclusion in the Act. In two independent Federal Court cases (Davis WA G130 of 1989 and Doessel Qld G62 of 1990) the courts found the two ex&hyphen;members of the RAN had been `allotted'. Davis had served in Malaya in 1956 and 57. As a result of these cases ex&hyphen;members of the RAN who served in Malaya and who had, at that time, claims before the Department of Veterans' Affairs for benefits, had their claims accepted. Eight weeks after the Doessel decision the Act was amended to require allotment to have been by written instrument. In parliament, it was claimed the amendment was necessary to restore the intended purpose of the exclusion, reasons for which can not, allegedly, be found.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) Naval personnel were not, as claimed, bound by the `Special Overseas Service' requirements, introduced in the Repatriation (Special Overseas

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In supporting teachers, there is no doubt that schools must have a principal who shows strong leadership and, through his teaching staff, ensures that, as well as being made aware of their rights, students are also made aware of their responsibilities both to themselves and to others. Rules should be applied consistently and fairly and have clearly stated consequences for positive and negative behaviours. The rules should be developed jointly between parents, teachers and students to create a sense of ownership.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Appropriate behaviour should be taught not as a separate curriculum item but as an integral part of the teaching process. There is no doubt that teachers are responsible for the pastoral care of students in their class, irrespective of the academic subjects they teach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said what should occur in a perfect world, what is actually happening? From some of the feedback I received from schools, particularly high schools, all is not well when it comes to being able to discipline students for untoward behaviour. In New South Wales there are procedures in place to deal with dangerous and difficult students, and no doubt these are mirrored in other states. Procedures such as suspension, exclusion and expulsion are seen by the New South Wales Department of School Education as strategies to be used only in serious cases of misbehaviour. In accordance with these procedures, principals are asked to use their authority immediately if they believe the safety of staff or students is at risk.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2736">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While one could believe all these measures would cover all eventualities, they do not, and because time is short I cannot raise a great many anecdotal cases of which I am aware. It is enough to say that, while most high schools may be considered as being not particularly violent, there is now a trend towards outrageous verbal abuse of students and teachers alike by miscreant pupils. Some of the verbal abuse is mixed with threats of violence directed towards teachers and, in a number of incidences of which I am aware, directed to young female teachers. The report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sticks and stones</EMPHASIS> confirms this where it states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Teachers' unions expressed concern about the impact of violence on their members. The Committee was told that education departments had limited capacity to provide long-term care to people who were affected by violent behaviour. Teachers who were assaulted had great difficulty in returning to school. Many of them never returned. It was not always the physical assault that caused the major problems. Verbal assault, or a place in which their security was threatened by students, had a devastating impact on teachers' confidence and on their ability to feel safe in a school environment. Teachers were sometimes transferred to another school, rather than the system addressing the violence which had occurred.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is not equitable or just that one or two students, no matter what their background or history, should be able to detrimentally affect the educational process of their fellow students and demean the authority and standing of their teachers with unruly behaviour. While there is a process to be worked through in consultation with the student, teacher and parent, this often breaks down when the student is recalcitrant or, in some cases today, the parents or guardians are not supportive of the teacher, school or educative process or the parents cannot simply be found.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said at the commencement of my speech, I am only touching the surface of this subject. It is really related to how we view teachers in our society, what we expect of them as in many cases they take on the role of guardian, mentor as well as educator. What education and ethical standards should we expect of them? What remuneration should they obtain for the difficult and now sometimes dangerous occupational role they fill? As parliamentarians, we should not only be 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> pondering on these important issues but also be taking positive action as a matter of extreme urgency not only for reasons of equity but also, if surveys are correct, because of the growing number of existing teachers who wish they were anything else but a teacher.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am aware that the present federal government has made statements that it wishes to acknowledge the role of teachers, to give them authority and to lift their status to where it was some decades ago and to where it should be today.

Teachers are often very much undervalued, poorly paid for their efforts, too often subjected to unfair criticism and let down time and time again by educational administrators. Over the last 20 years, primary schools&mdash;the very place where children gain literacy, numeracy, social, communication and technological skills&mdash;have been seriously overlooked and ignored. Twenty years ago, my own state of South Australia was recognised internationally as a world leader in primary education. What went wrong?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, primary and junior primary schools were then administered by their own bureaucrats, by a department separate from secondary schools, TAFE and universities. Differential expenditure existed between the various sectors, but nowhere to the extent it exists today where primary schools are very much the poor relation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amalgamation of the schools sector into a single bureaucracy very quickly ended any effective advocacy by educational administra 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2737"> tors for primary and junior primary schools. Primary and junior primary staff, who then often enjoyed far more public confidence from the community than their secondary counterparts or TAFE or university counterparts, very soon realised that their needs were nearly always related to a third order of importance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During this period of administrative failure to primary and junior primary schools, the expectations on teachers in these schools were raised dramatically. Primary schools, largely organised with one teacher and 30&hyphen;plus same age children for a year, were confronted with the following curriculum demands, and I bet I miss some of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Language arts included reading, writing, speaking, listening, spelling, grammar, comprehension, poetry, literature studies, library skills and often a foreign language. Mathematics subjects included numeracy sets and logic, graphing, geometry, algebra and computing skills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Environmental studies subjects included geography, history, social studies, health, science, sex education, road safety, girls education, equal opportunity, Aboriginal studies included ethnic cultures, religious education, media studies, behaviour management, conflict resolution, collaborative learning and peer relationships. Expressive arts subjects included music, choir singing, drama, art and craft, home economics, outdoor education, physical education, dance, swimming, athletics and team and individual sports. All of this plus an understanding of poverty, unemployment, breakdown in families, child abuse and so on. And, God forbid, some people in this country wonder why there is a problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The expectations were raised. The support to meet those expectations was taken away. Teacher training became confused and added to the responsibilities of the classroom teacher. Gender balance&mdash;or, more accurately, gender imbalance&mdash;grossly favoured female teachers. Many schools had no male teachers whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recruitment of teachers was in turmoil. Entry into the profession by young teachers 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> was difficult, and that necessary dynamism created by enthusiastic young teachers went missing. The existing teacher force got older, lost morale, learned not to complain and focused increasingly on retirement or another occupation, but nevertheless still tried to do their best in increasingly difficult circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the best teachers just left. Many others took packages to retire early or to pursue other careers. The remaining teacher force got older again, and silent resentment grew as the lack of empathy for teachers' and children's plight became commonplace in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of those four major subject areas I mentioned earlier, may I state quite unequivocally the following. In 25 years as a teacher, a consultant and a primary school principal for most of that time, I have never seen or expected a teacher to be proficient in those four areas. Yet, in the face of the obvious, teachers and children were, and still are, deployed as one teacher for 30&hyphen;plus children for the whole school year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Alternative and more appropriate forms of deployment require additional staffing, at least one to two additional staff per 100 enrolments. But that issue&mdash;and that is the core issue&mdash;has never effectively been addressed by any state government or teachers union in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In schools where I was principal I soon learned that to manage a quality educational program I needed to at least remove one of those subject areas from the responsibility of a classroom teacher. The area that I found most suitable was the specialisation in expressive arts. I did whatever was required legally&mdash;albeit questionable by some&mdash;to create a specialist music/drama teacher, a specialist physical education/dance teacher and a specialist arts and craft teacher in all the schools where I was principal. This allowed classroom teachers to concentrate on the other three areas and it provided time for professional development. As a consequence of that, the classes were marginally higher, but overall the benefits outweighed the disadvantages.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2738">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I should point out that, if you were in a primary school with an enrolment of less than 300, the aforementioned deployment was well nigh impossible. Teachers resisted the introduction of specialist teachers, complaining about the increased class size and loss of control over all the curriculum. But after the implementation they never did.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, during this 20-year period innovative strategies in primary schools were strangled. Other institutions in this country did not help. The leadership expected from universities went missing. They saw the necessary increased expenditure for primary schools as a potential threat to their own. Similarly, no sympathy came from TAFE or secondary schools, except on very rare occasions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The leadership from institutions like the church went missing. Conditions in many private schools were worse than public schools, which explained some of their reticence. The leadership from trade unions went missing. Like the church, they became more preoccupied with their dwindling membership. The leadership of the media went missing. A Sydney study showed that 96 per cent of media references to children are negative. Parents went missing. Two income families and single parent families became the norm in many areas and the opportunity for those parents to become involved in school matters diminished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But out in that wider community general resentment and anger grew and teachers in primary schools became easy targets for all sorts of pent-up emotions and stress, much of which had nothing to do with education. Teachers became an easy group to blame for any government policy poorly received in the community. Parents blamed teachers for their own inadequacies on issues of parenting and discipline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time as those negative factors began to have a cumulative effect, teachers were asking for a fair go for the kids and a fair go for them. They were clearly stating in the mid-1970s that up to 10 per cent of children had poor literacy and numeracy skills. They were ignored. In the mid-1980s the 10 per cent figure had grown to 10 per 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cent plus. They were still ignored. In the 1990s the figures were 20 per cent and they were common.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Several university academics denied at this time the literacy crisis. Their motivation was obvious. Primary education and early intervention were competitors for that education dollar. But the greatest denial of all came from state governments through very compliant educational bureaucrats. The 1970s to the 1990s were 20 years of failure to acknowledge a problem growing rapidly. The minister now regularly uses the figure of 30 per cent illiteracy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the federal government's response? Test the kids. Cripple government schools. Blame the teachers. But is there any substantive understanding or acknowledgment of the problem? No way. This government operates on the lowest common popular denominator.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A small or indeed large transfer of enrolments to private schools will not solve the problem. Testing will not solve the problem. I am not opposed to testing, and I point out that teacher union opposition to testing is politically stupid&mdash;albeit correct in educational terms. The government's strategy is simply to adopt popular tokenism to a problem. Mark my words, it has no hope of success whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This parliament, albeit the federal government, is not directly responsible for primary school education, but it does need to display leadership to overcome the `village hall' mentality of many state governments towards primary education. The motion by the member for Riverina is at least a small step in the right direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an oft repeated cliche that our greatest resource is our children. The reality, however, in Australian society is very different. Kids get a rough go in this country. They always have and it is time that changed. It is time the people who care for them probably more than even their parents&mdash;and who do so very effectively&mdash;got a fair go too.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is all very well for some commentators to get up and point to headlines that focus on a very small group of incompetent or unsuitable teachers. That some of these teachers remain 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2739"> in the system is the fault of educational administrators. It is not the fault of the teachers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the motion, with the exception of point (3). I simply say this to the member for Riverina: if you want literacy and numeracy to be tackled effectively you have to give primary schools&mdash;the very place where it occurs&mdash;the resources to do it properly. No amount of screaming or raving and ranting will change it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Teaching children who want to learn is very easy. The real challenge for teachers and for governments is to take on the children who for some reason or another do not want to learn. That is the real challenge, and that is the real challenge that this motion put forward by the member for Riverina needs to address.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also congratulate the member for Riverina (Mr Hicks) for bringing forward this important motion to the House today. I am pleased to support it. The motion, I believe, succinctly encapsulates the topic that is widely debated in conversation but is rarely espoused in the public area because it is not quite politically correct. We have something like 220,000 teachers across Australia who are responsible for one of the most vital jobs in our society, namely, the education of our children. The average age of teachers today is rising, as the previous speaker said. I think it is something in excess of 43 years now.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He says 50&mdash;he may be right. Their role and what they are expected to do have changed dramatically over the last quarter of a century. It is becoming increasingly difficult for teachers just to get on and do what they do best, namely, teach. They have to manage a whole host of emerging social problems without proper training and support and sometimes without proper auth ority. The time and effort spent on this means that they have less time available to spend with their students. It also causes disruption in classes to students who want to get on and learn themselves. All this, of course, discourages and disillusions otherwise good and dedicated teachers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are seeing increasing reports in the newspapers about violence in classrooms becoming prevalent in some areas. This is putting an enormous strain not just on pupils but particularly on teachers&mdash;especially young teachers and especially young female teachers. There are some students in some areas that have become almost `untouchable' in their behaviour. If we do not address this properly and fully and head on, it is a problem that will only grow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are in many ways losing our way in this society. The responsibility for all this is multifaceted. Parents have a responsibility here. They seem to want every other child disciplined except their own. They will not back up teachers when the teachers are right. I do not think parents attend school functions and become involved in what is going on in schools as much as they could. I see that as I move around. Governments have taken away many of the commonsense authority measures from teachers. Society in general seems to be putting too much emphasis on rights instead of responsibilities. There is a trend to move away from the necessary degree of regimentation and discipline that I believe should exist in schools. We need some public debate on this very important topic and growing problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Education departments also have a vital role to play. They must revamp some training for their teachers. Teachers must be taught how to deal with aggression and inappropriate behaviour amongst students so that they can become better equipped in conflict resolution and develop effective communication and conflict skills. To a large extent, teachers have been left out on their own on this. Indeed, pupils themselves could be taught some of these skills. In fact, school rules in some instances could be tightened up to include a clear section for parents on the consequences of inappropriate behaviour by their children when they are students. Perhaps they should be asked to sign off on that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many areas here that do need addressing. It is an evolving problem that has happened to the degree that it has only over the last couple of decades or so. I do strongly 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2740"> support the member for Riverina in that teachers should be supported on that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, I would say that the matters that I have touched on in this debate do need more attention. Our teachers must be backed up because they are at the forefront of having to deal with these matters. They have to receive greater support not only from the schools themselves and the education authorities but also from the parents. With that, the teachers will gain greater skills to deal with the problems, and they can get on with what they do best&mdash;teaching our nation's children.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a primary trained teacher of many years standing, I am delighted to be able to rise in this place to put on record my strong support for Australian teachers. Those in this place who are so inclined keep very close contact with all aspects of the education of young people and are very aware of the problems mentioned by the previous speakers today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like other speakers, I thank the member for Riverina (Mr Hicks) for bringing the issue of the need for greater support for teachers to this House. Hopefully, it will engender some debate out there in the wider community. Those of us who have been teachers in a former life, and especially those who operated in the primary field like my esteemed colleague the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford), have regaled many here on countless occasions with, `I told you this would happen; it is only a matter of time.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note, as the honourable member for Port Adelaide said, the third part of the motion, which calls for more authority to be given to teachers so that teachers and their students are not placed in danger and teachers can get on with the job of educating those students who wish to be taught. In my humble opinion, this is not what it is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problems facing teachers stem from the decision taken during the 1970s by governments of all persuasions to  restrict spending and resources to primary schools and the children they taught. Blind Freddy could have told you that removing the necessary support 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> mechanisms from primary teachers would result in an inability to ensure that all children, irrespective of their social status or ethnic background, would leave primary schools and enter the next stage in their education without all the skills necessary to succeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is remarkable to note, but it is really quite simple, that unless you get the foundations built correctly, unless you can ensure that all the children you have in your care are immersed in the love of learning and unless you can provide each and every one of them with the resources and support to undertake the complexity that is early education not only are you selling the children short but you are going to place enormous stress and strain on the societal framework.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australian teachers are doing a fantastic job trying to cope as they are with the complexity that is modern education and having to face budget constraints year after year. We have a middle aged and weary work force. Without a huge injection of new blood into the teaching ranks, the problems alluded to by the honourable member for Riverina will occur even more frequently. And what are governments doing about that? Absolutely nothing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The prospect of having to provide so many additional services within the schools is another problem, because they are not being undertaken by state community service departments, and this only adds to the teaching burden. I wonder how you can justify all the associated costs placed on taxpayers by having to provide youth shelters, homeless allowances and innumerable youth workers, for example, and having to respond to one of the world's highest youth suicide rates, seeing our youth increasingly being placed in juvenile correction institutions and having such appalling youth unemployment rates when all that is required is a fraction of that money we currently expend on all the above to be returned to primary education in the way of more resources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What do I mean by more resources? An obvious first step is that all primary schools must have&mdash;as the honourable member for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2741"> Port Adelaide said&mdash;full&hyphen;time libraries to engender a love of learning and full&hyphen;time physical education teachers to enable children, irrespective of whether they are academic or non&hyphen;academic and whether they have good hand&hyphen;eye coordination, to participate in all ranges of physical education. It is the same for music and special education. So we need to have librarians, physical education, music and special education teachers in every primary school so that every primary child can realise their full potential.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It happened when I taught in the 1960s and the 1970s and then it gradually faded out until we had this&mdash;I do not know where it came from; somewhere overseas they used to allude&mdash;and we started to go down the drain. So, instead of having close on 15 per cent of our primary children entering high schools currently at risk, a simple reallocation of perhaps one&hyphen;twentieth of the money we are spending when we are dragging them out of the gutters, taking the needles out of their arms, trying to counsel them by saying `Don't kill yourself' could be spent giving our children what they deserve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why can't the states do it? It amazes me. I thank the honourable member for Riverina for bringing this to the parliament's attention. Hopefully some of our state colleagues will listen and we can get this simple reallocation. I agree with the member for Port Adelaide: universities have had it too good for too long, and so have secondary colleges.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> (Time expired)</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This issue has occasioned great division within government ranks. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS>  of 18 March referred to comments by Senator Minchin about some of his colleagues that they were essentially grandstanding. This is at a time when the Premier of South Australia was attempting to move on government policy on this matter.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is pressure from the Premier and the SA Government, and the party would support that pressure, for the Federal Government to take a stand on tariffs.

<PARA STYLE="Para">But some of those opposite, such as the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles), have been very dismissive of these kinds of comments, certainly unconcerned about the very great impact that these threatened changes will have. As the representative of Reid, which formerly had the Ford motor plant and has significant component parts manufacturing units within the electorate, I certainly associate myself with the motion of the member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) which seeks to take into consideration a variety of countries in our region. We see his comments that in Vietnam there are import restriction levels of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2742"> 60 to 200 per cent; in South Korea, 25 to 100 per cent; and in Malaysia, five to 200 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor's policy, announced recently, is that there should be no change to 2005 with a review in 2003. This is the context in which this should be considered: the fact that we are not competing on a level playing field and the fact that Australian workers do have to compete against this level of protection. As people well know, that takes many forms. The wider context is the problems of manufacturing industry in this country. Michael Dwyer commented in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 17 March:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The March quarter survey of manufacturing in NSW, prepared by the Australian Business Chamber and released yesterday, provides more evidence of the current malaise afflicting the manufacturing sector.</PARA>

The staff reductions expected by NSW manufacturers, when translated nationally, would see 7,000 further jobs lost this year.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is the reality that manufacturers in South Australia and regional Australia face with the determination of this government to follow ideological facets rather than look at the economic reality that faces these industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This comes at a time when the government condemns people to go to meaningless efforts in regard to dole diaries where employers around this country are saying, `We are not going to have any part of it; we are not going to fill out these forms,' and these people are condemned to being thrown on the scrap heap and deprived of benefits. It comes at a time when these people, many of whom have worked in this industry not for the 12 months that the government says is going to be the tryout period in small business in this country but for 20 or 30 years, are going to be thrown out of employment; and they are going to be condemned to a situation where they, like many young people, will be forced into the requirements of working for the dole.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson) would fully understand that there is no level playing field throughout the world. The key feature he should understand is that tariffs around the world are at about five per cent. There are a few anomalies, I concede that point, but on balance tariffs have fallen and average five per cent around the world. However, this motion would have us believe that tariff reductions would be tantamount to devastating the Australian automobile industry, while at the same time it praises the improvements in the industry over the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2743"> past six years, a period when tariffs have been falling each year by 2.5 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the member for Reid should understand, it was the previous Labor government's decision to lower the automobile tariff barrier from 57 per cent down to 22 per cent. It was gained with bipartisan support from the shadow minister at the time, Mr Ian McLachlan, and people like me. That tariff reduction exposed the industry to greater competition and led to the great gains which the motion now refers to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By contrast, for most of this century, our car industry has been highly protected and uncompetitive by world standards. If tariff protection were an effective way to secure the future of Australian industries, then by 1990 we would have had the best car industry and the best TCF industry in the world following 70 years of protection&mdash;that is, if the arguments of the honourable member for Reid were to be sustained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tariff reductions, far from being devastating, have arguably secured the future of Australia's car industry. I have visited a number of the automobile factories in Geelong. I have a good news story to tell about the improvements on the ground that have occurred in the factories and in their industry since tariff rates have been gradually reduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At Henderson's Automotive Group, where they construct car seats for the four manufacturers, cost reductions of two to three per cent each year have been passed on to the four main car component manufacturers. They have an open mind on tariffs. They conceded that had tariffs never fallen the hard decisions would not have ever been taken in that factory. They now have a position where there are good industrial relations and good teamwork in the factory. They are even doing their own maintenance on their own equipment, and everyone is part of the team. Surveys of employer attitude show that higher pay is not the No. 1 issue, evidence of a real teamwork culture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have also been to Pilkingtons, which manufactures windscreens for both the domestic industry as well as for exports. Costs are down 15 per cent over the last six years. Productivity is up a staggering 92 per cent. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> They have now got 13 unions down to one union. Quality performance has improved remarkably&mdash;the rate of 7,000 faults per million is down to 300 faults per million today. That is a remarkable change in the productive performance. This has led to a $50 million renewed investment by Pilkingtons in their Geelong operations, including a new factory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also visited Paratus Industries which constructs upholstery for the motor car industry. It employs 70 people. Likewise, it has achieved cost reductions in each year on components for the Ford motor company. It has moved to two shifts, giving greater flexibility to the work force, especially to female workers. It has embraced enterprise bargaining with a focus on training and continuous improvement. It has regular work force meetings to discuss the progress of the firm, possible improvements and where it stands in the state of the market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On Friday, 14 March, I visited the Toyota factory at Altona in Melbourne with members of the government industry committee. This is a very up&hyphen;to&hyphen;date factory participating in a global car manufacturing operation with a potential to export to 21 countries. Profitability is improving in that plant. As they pointed out very clearly, the exchange rate was a key factor which eroded their profitability in 1996. They made the point that sales tax was a big issue&mdash;something that the Labor government put on. That 22 per cent sales tax was a bigger issue than the 22 per cent on tariffs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also met with the Geelong Manufacturing Industry Task Force. They are very concerned about the tariff argument in Geelong. They talked about micro&hyphen;economic reform, market access and industrial relations, not protection, industry assistance or backdoor subsidies. Theirs was a practical, on-the&hyphen;ground assessment of how they saw the tariff argument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Protectionist arguments have been demolished both in theory and in practice. This motion simply wants to have it both ways: to concede that competition has brought about great improvements in the local automobile industry while at the same time claiming that protection is the answer for the future. Protection never secured the future of any industry.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The importance of the motor vehicle manufacturing industry to Australia really goes without saying. That is part of the problem, I suspect. This industry is so important that we can, at times, take it for granted. I suspect that the leadership of the government in this place is taking it for granted and is at risk, in its the adoption of the Industry Commission's recommendations, of putting the jobs of those workers not only in my electorate and my state but indeed right across Australia at risk. Because something is so important that it goes without saying does not mean that we should not, from time to time, remind ourselves of the very great importance of that industry to Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nearly 50,000 jobs across Australia&mdash;half of them in manufacturing; half of them in the related component manufacturing industries&mdash;are vitally important to the 50,000 families that are associated with them and to states like South Australia, which play a very vital role in the industry. My own state of South Australia has some 25 per cent of the work force employed in the motor vehicle industry. That means that it is a very important industry to us in South Australia. The impact on regional economies can never be understated. We must constantly remind ourselves of the devastating impact which any withdrawal of support for this industry would have on the regional economy of South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not support the maintenance of inefficient industries through high levels of tariff; but, unfortunately, the Liberal and National parties throughout history have had only two levels of commitment to tariffs: they have been either on or off. During the Second World War and post the Second World War, they promoted massive tariffs across the board, and in particular on this industry, and then we saw in the Fightback options and beyond a commitment to zero tariff policies. It is this on again, off again adoption of tariffs which has been the cause of the problems to date.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, the member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) has correctly pointed out the gains&mdash;as has been pointed out by the member for Calwell, Andrew Theophanous, in his motion&mdash;which we have made through managed tariff reform. That is the distinction to be drawn here: managed, moderate tariff reform&mdash;in other words, the Button plan. It was the Button plan which gave us the increase in industry productivity. It was the Button plan which gave us the massive increase in exports from this industry.

I am sure that some honourable members opposite&mdash;some&mdash;will speak in this debate, as they have done outside this debate in the public sector, and indicate their support for a retention of a managed tariff policy. That is what is vital to South Australia&mdash;not the abandonment of tariffs overnight, not the introduction of high levels of tariffs and protection. That will not support the industry either in the long run. A managed transition is what is so vital.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a managed transition which the Industry Commission seeks to pull away from this industry. It is a managed transition which this government is, I suspect, in danger of walking away from. That will do more than anything to undermine the jobs in Australia, in South Australia&mdash;in Kingston and, in particular, in Bonython. The employees at General Motors, Lear Corporation, GNB Technologies, Mullins Wheels and Tubalco&mdash;which between them support some 7,000 families in my electorate and pour millions of dollars into our economy&mdash;are the vital people which this government is in grave danger of ignoring in this policy debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen, throughout the history of tariffs in this country, many advocating very high levels of tariffs in production. That is not appropriate. We have seen others like John 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2745"> Olsen, the now Premier of South Australia, when the Fightback policy was before the public, supporting a zero tariff option. That will not do overnight either. What we need is what we have had previously under the Button plan: managed reform, gradual reductions and then, in 2000, a pause while we assess the impact of this change, while we see what our neighbours are doing and while we work out a reasoned, balanced way of moving this industry forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the managed reform, we have seen massive growth in exports, we have seen productivity gains and we have seen the work force cooperate actively with management through the union movement to ensure that those gains are locked in for the workers, for the companies, for the state and for Australia. That is the kind of reform I want to see continued, and I am sure that the motion before the House seeks to do just that. I commend the motion to honourable members.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot support this motion on the automobile industry. This is the most incredible mickey mouse motion that I have seen come before the House in a long time. It does not address the issues, and it is simply there to create a bit of fuss and to look good for the Labor Party. Let us face it: on this issue they need a lot of reason to look good.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us have a look at what the Labor Party actually did about tariffs. Let us start in 1973. What happened? Gough Whitlam got up one morning and said, `Today, let's drop tariffs by 25 per cent, shall we. Let's not talk to the tariff board about it, and far from discussing this with industry we'll just drop tariffs by 25 per cent.' We all know what happened to the industry following that drop.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1988 the next drop came. The level of tariffs had gone up in the interim under the Fraser government, but in 1988 what happened? There was a 12.5 per cent drop. Thankyou to the Labor Party&mdash;this self-same Labor Party which is putting forward this mickey mouse motion today. Have we forgotten about the 25 per cent in 1973? Have we forgotten about the 12.5 per cent in 1988? From 1988 to 2000, there will have been a 30 per cent drop.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All the drops in tariffs in the history of this country have come through the Labor Party: 25 per cent in 1973, 12&half; per cent in 1988 and 30 per cent from 1988 to 2000. Is the best the Labor Party can do to come up with an excuse for the motion that the member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) has done today? They are not fooling the people in the industry; they are not fooling the workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Previously in this debate we had the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) trying to convince us that he was defending the car industry and the workers. Was not the member for Corio an assistant who worked in the office of the minister for industry in 1988? In 1993, when he was elected a member, did we hear him come into this parliament and say, `Tariffs shouldn't come down'? No, he was saying, `Bring them down by 2&half; per cent.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The motion from the member of Calwell, which the member for Corio supports, as does the member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans), is an excuse for a motion, isn't it? It is a personal attack on the head of the Productivity Commission, Bill Scales. It contains words like `firm belief' and `is of the view'. Isn't this the whole problem with what is going on with the industry today? We have on one side the religion of anti-tariffs, those people who are saying that tariffs are bad and who came forward with a report&mdash;as did the Productivity Commission&mdash;that was not founded on good evidence but simply came up with excuses to drop the tariff. That was not good enough. What we expect from the Productivity Commission&mdash;and any report from the government&mdash;is a report founded on fact, and good fact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is also wrong with this motion is that it talks about belief, as if somehow on the other side of the argument there is a religion now to be followed. This parliament should not adopt one side or the other of this debate but say to the Productivity Commission and everyone else, `Give us good arguments. Just don't give us a report that gives us your religion, what you believe. Tell us what are the advantages and disadvantages of either policy, and make sure that those arguments stand up for analysis.' The arguments of the Productivity Commission do not stand up to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2746"> analysis, but nor does this mickey mouse motion from the member for Calwell.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Once again I have the honour of following the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus) in a debate concerning the motor vehicle industry. It is pleasing to see this member supporting the motor vehicle industry, but it ought to be noted at the same time that the Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> , as recently as this morning, reported that there was a dinner organised by the member for Sturt (Mr Pyne), which the members for Grey (Mr Wakelin), Makin (Mrs Draper), Boothby (Dr Southcott) and Wakefield (Mr Andrew), for example, simply would not attend. They would not go to hear their own Premier talking about the importance of the motor vehicle industry to the South Australian economy. Those members, unlike the member for Hindmarsh, are simply toeing the party line and the government line at the expense of their own electorates, and that is entirely regrettable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a great deal of pleasure in supporting this motion as someone who, like the member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), has many of my constituents working in the motor vehicle industry, directly employed by that industry by Ford or indirectly employed by that industry through automotive component manufacturers. I take the members of the government back to the coalition's pre&hyphen;election employment policy which said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Coalition policies will move Australia back towards full employment: the situation where paid employment is available to anyone who seeks it . . . The National Job Creation Strategy will deliver this objective.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The language was clear and unequivocal. But, instead, what we have seen is unemployment growing from 8.4 per cent to 8.8 per cent under this government, long&hyphen;term unemployment on the increase and the mid&hyphen;term budget forecasting for unemployment revised upwards from 8.25 per cent to 8.5 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On top of that, we find the Productivity Commission inquiring into automotive tariffs and not engaging in any serious examination of the impact of their proposals on employment within the automotive industry. They did not examine, for example, the concern ex 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> pressed by the National Secretary of the Vehicle Division of the Manufacturing Workers Union that removing tariff protection could cost 30,000 jobs and threaten another 30,000 in the component industry. I would point out that in the northern region of Melbourne the automotive industry remains the most significant employer and that Ford and its associated suppliers and distributors account for over seven per cent of all jobs in the region. My own calculations are that, if the automotive industry were to disappear, unemployment in the north&hyphen;western region would go up to 20 per cent and perhaps even beyond. It is extraordinary, against that background, that the Productivity Commission can disregard unemployment as a social issue. The majority members of that commission put up a recommendation for scenario B: a reduction in tariffs of 2.5 per cent per annum&mdash;from 15 per cent in the year 2000 to five per cent by the year 2004. Scenario B, by their own calculations at page I18, is the regime which does the most damage to unemployment, cutting it by 3.5 per cent by the year 2010!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I further make the observation that the motor vehicle restructuring plan has been incessantly heralded with the promise of lower real car prices. But what is the evidence? We have had tariffs being reduced since 1984 but, in terms of affordability, a family six is now 1.4 times more difficult to purchase than it was then. The information that I got from the Parliamentary Library&mdash;supplied by the NRMA to them&mdash;was that the price of an average car, for example the Holden Commodore Executive base model, has risen from $15,756 in 1986 to $29,510 in 1996, an increase of over 87 per cent, with the increase in new car prices outstripping the CPI by 42 per cent! When the Productivity Commission and some of its cheer squad amongst members opposite say this is going to give us lower motor vehicle prices, the evidence suggests the contrary. There is no evidence that these tariff cuts will lead to lower motor vehicle prices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to point out the cumulative impact of tariff cuts and automotive industry restructuring on a region like the northern 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2747"> suburbs of Melbourne. It is not just the automotive industry that has been important to us, it has been the textile, clothing and footwear industries as well. They have endured a long period of restructuring. Employment in these industries has dropped from 60,000 in Victoria back in 1986 to 40,000 odd in 1996&mdash;a cut of one third. Nothing has replaced them. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This motion provides members with the opportunity to put on the record their views on the importance of the car industry and of the people that are employed in that industry. But it is also evidence of Labor's policy backflips now that it is in opposition. This is a belated attempt to show concern for workers, but it was the workers who were so badly let down by Labor over 13 years. I agree that local car and component manufacturers have met the challenge of adapting to a declining tariff regime. Exports have increased and our international standing in automotive production has improved. I have already, like other members on this side of the House, expressed my concern at the majority recommendation of the Productivity Commission's interim report. The fact is that both sides of the economic debate on tariffs have attracted educated opinion since Federation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is clear to me, as the elected representative for Adelaide, however, is that there are significant social costs involved if we do not get the balance right between international competitiveness and maintaining a protected automotive industry employing many thousands of South Australians. Each one of these workers has a face, a name, a family and a community. The public debate affecting their futures deserves more than just providing the Labor Party an opportunity to play catch&hyphen;up politics. The solidarity shown by Labor backbenchers to their current leader's backflip on this issue belies a greater disloyalty to the Australian public. Only six years ago those opposition members, now championing the cause of protectionism, backed Bob Hawke's decision to lower protection levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have seen first&hyphen;hand the value of Labor's record on protecting workers and their jobs. At the Australian National workshops at 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Islington workers are facing an uncertain future due to Labor's gross mismanagement. The rhetoric of Labor has not changed and it has the same cynical motivation, that is, say and do whatever is politically expedient at the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor's policy change has not resulted from any soul searching exercise or a sudden revelation that their previous tariff policy was wrong. Remember, Labor never says sorry. Labor is just up to one more political stunt. Careful consideration must be given, not with an eye to short&hyphen;term goals but long-term stability and employment in the automotive industry. That is just what the government will do when it gets the final report from the Productivity Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me remind the House again of the words of the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) commenting on the closure of a car plant in his own electorate in 1992 due to the Button tariff reductions:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was always recognised that there were going to be job losses . . . that has always been accepted as a necessary part of making the industry competitive.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The member for Hotham's sudden change of heart typifies Labor's hypocrisy on this issue. I would also like to oppose the implication in this motion that the membership of the committee cannot produce an objective final report. This is a rather bizarre observation given Ian Webber's contribution  which is most welcome. The government has recognised the need for a pragmatic and experienced voice on the commission and Mr Webber's appointment illustrates a willingness on the part of the government to be open minded on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has already told this House:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . when the final report of the Productivity Commission is  received by the government, it will be addressed against a number of considerations. The first of those considerations is the absolute determination of my government to preserve a viable Australian car manufacturing industry . . . We will be conscious of the impact of any decision we take on regional areas of Australia. I am well aware of the importance of the car industry to the South Australian economy.

<PARA STYLE="Para">I unashamedly support the car industry. We were wrong in the past to have such high levels of protection, but if the goal is for a universal level playing field then let reform take place on an industry by industry basis. When car tariffs are reduced by our trading partners then we will be compelled to do likewise. But rapid reduction of tariffs to secure the high moral ground in international trading forums and to increase pressure on our trading partners exaggerates Australia's influence and underestimates the desire of our Asian trading partners to keep their automotive industries heavily protected.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to grieve today about the range and impact of government policies in my electorate of Melbourne Ports. Repeatedly we are told by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and other ministers at question time what a great job the government is doing. In terms of government policy and the implementation of those policies, I wonder what impact they are having in an electorate like my own. For example, in the course of the last fortnight there has been an increase in attendance at my office of women who are separated, who cannot get legal aid for restraining orders, who find themselves rearing children in situations where they are separated from their husbands, the house has a mortgage, there is not sufficient money, there is no property settlement and their incapacity to get legal aid to pursue their rights in situations where assault is common is now placing them in an impossible position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What do the proposed cutbacks in operational subsidies in child care mean? What do they mean to parents of an average Australian family? It means that all parents who have their children at community based centres will, after 1 July this year, have to pay an extra $25 per week for child care. Sole parents will possibly have to pay a total of $85 in child care out of their basic weekly benefit of $175. Again, the burden of that falls most heavily on those women who have to care for their children and who have to work to supplement the family income. So these two groups are, as a result of government policy, finding themselves in continually difficult circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there are the changes to rent assistance. I have read some prying documents in my time; this one is from a government that prides itself on what it is doing for the average Australian family. There are many people in my electorate who live in boarding houses, in accommodation which, on no real examination, could be described as flash or indeed effective. Now they have to fill in a government questionnaire which asks them: do you live alone&mdash;that is, no-one else shares your bathroom, bedroom or kitchen?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my community many of the people living on social service payments have never really had a home of their own. Many of them are living in boarding houses. What does this government want to do? It asks them: do you share your bathroom? Most people tend to have a bath in private. They are asked: do you live alone in a caravan, mobile home or boat in either a caravan park or a marina; do you have the right to the provision of meals on a regular basis with your accommodation costs; and do you live in a retirement home or granny flat with the sole right to use your bathroom, bedroom or kitchen?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These questionnaires go on. They are directed at that group in the community who need understanding and a sense of compassion from this government. And it is a great exercise. These people, many of whom have never had decent living standards in their whole lives, are now required to fill in this kind of questionnaire. Why? Because this 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2749"> government feels that somehow or other they might be being touched.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, there is an increased cost to lodge a sponsorship, the removal of special assistance category applications from the former USSR, and higher points needed for English. Is it not a fact that when migrants come out to Australia, particularly from countries like those in the former Soviet Union, they are endeavouring to make their way and they want to sponsor other members of their family? As part of this policy they find that they have to pay more when most of them are really struggling to get their families established.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been cutbacks to schools in my electorate, with pressure on state schools. It is interesting to see what is happening in education. The Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) in this House gets up and rants and raves. The state schools in my electorate are at peak capacity. The state government is still endeavouring to close some schools. In my electorate there is a school which the state government admits is in need of an effective toilet. They admit that it is a public health menace, that the toilet is dangerous for the children to use. Children go to the toilet as directed by teachers three at a time. What is the proposal of the Victorian government? What is good enough for these kids? A portable toilet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time, any religious crank who wants to go off and buy himself a block of land in the hills around Melbourne in order to lecture a small group of children that the earth is flat can get heavy Commonwealth subsidies. I was one who lived through the state aid argument when it erupted in this society and I have never opposed grants to private schools. But we are getting an imbalance. Why is a parent not entitled to say, `I want my kid to go to the local state school because it reflects the social milieu of the community in which the child lives and I opt for a small school. I do not want a large school'? Why is that less of a choice than the right of a parent to say, `I want my kid to go to a church school because I want them to have the benefit of a religious education'?</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you look at the policies being employed by this minister for education and complement them with the policies employed by the state government, the choices available to state school parents are being limited. Teachers are being overworked and the school system itself is under threat. If it continues this way we are going to be facing another state aid argument in perhaps three to five years from now, and that would be a disaster for this community. There is no need for it. It is time that the minister for education in this House devoted his attention to looking at what is happening in the state school system in electorate after electorate in Melbourne.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In St Kilda in my electorate the break&hyphen;up of the Commonwealth Employment Services&mdash;CES&mdash;and the Department of Social Security as we know it could mean reduced services for many of the younger people in Melbourne Ports. It does not matter what the overall national average figure for unemployment is and it does not matter what government is in office, St Kilda has always been a place where younger people from dysfunctional families who have left home or have been forced to leave home gravitate. Therefore, whatever the national average of unemployment is, it will be three to four per cent higher in this area. There is a range of social problems related to that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The St Kilda Youth Access Centre, which provides some hope and some support for these younger people, is to be moved out of St Kilda to a new premises within the relocated St Kilda DSS to a destination unknown.

I have lost count of the number of adjournment debates, grievance debates, questions without notice and questions on notice on this subject.</PARA>

Indeed, most people tell me that they want a fairer system. That word `fair' crops up again and again. We need a system that is fair to all who are involved. We do not want to see children being used as pawns between two parents who have grown estranged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the past year I have been working hand in hand with officers in the Cannington office of the Child Support Agency which handles the cases for many people in my electorate of Canning. I have personally met with their staff on many occasions while trying to sort out a better arrangement for my constituents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the staff of the Child Support Agency as they have an extremely difficult job to do. Perhaps they, along with the staff in the social security offices, have the most difficult jobs of all in the federal government sphere. I must add that I do not envy them as they are often placed in a total no&hyphen;win situation where neither party involved is happy with the outcome proposed by the officers of the departments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Often I can solve a problem by merely making a telephone call to the Child Support Agency. But, more often than not, it is problems dealing with the act itself that create the bitterness, confusion and unhappiness experienced by so many people. That means the problem cannot be solved without changes to legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One case that I am currently trying to assist with is typical of many other Child Support Agency cases. A gentleman came to see me recently who was at his wit's end and had absolutely nowhere else to turn. I feel for this gentleman. However, there is nothing that I or the Child Support Agency can do as his problems are tied down by legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This gentleman's first wife left him around six years ago, and both he and she have since remarried to other people. His ex&hyphen;wife is about to have a baby to another man and he now has responsibility for his new wife and his wife's 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;old daughter, who is residing in his house and studying. This 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2751"> tangled mess might sound familiar to other members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Child Support Agency advised him that his primary obligation is to maintain his children and that, while he has a legal obligation to maintain his new wife, that obligation exists only if she is unable to support herself. He has further been advised that he has no duty to maintain his stepdaughter, yet this advice has been given despite the fact that his stepdaughter has been refused Austudy on the grounds that she lives in a house with her stepfather, who is deemed to be earning too much. That is totally confusing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He and his new wife are struggling to keep their heads above water. Meanwhile, he is aware that his ex&hyphen;wife and her new husband have had their house professionally painted throughout, had airconditioning fitted and have bought thousands of dollars worth of computer hardware. The computer is for the ex&hyphen;wife who runs a bookkeeping business from home. He has just been told that her husband has taken a year off work due to stress.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This gentleman outlined that when his children visit him under access rights they are forever saying how they have been to the movies, to Adventureworld, to Underwaterworld and on many other outings while he has to continually disappoint them when they are with him. He simply cannot afford to take them to any of these places as his financial resources cannot stretch any further. He feels that his maintenance payments are subsidising the lifestyle of his ex&hyphen;wife, her new husband and their baby. At the same time, he is struggling to provide for his new wife, his own home and health care. At the end of each week he is left with little, if any, money, pushing him even further into despair. Situations like this are a complete mess, no matter which way one looks at them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure all members would have received correspondence from the Lone Fathers Association of Australia last week. At the National Convention on Family Law and Child Support, held earlier this month, a number of resolutions dealing with the child support scheme were discussed. One of the motions 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> dealt with cases like the one I have just outlined. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current child support formula should be amended so that in the calculation of child support the income of a new spouse (including de facto spouse) of a custodial parent be taken into account.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I urge all members to read the letter and accompanying recommendations from the Lone Fathers Association, if they have not already done so. The resolutions are sensible, reasonable and fair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should look closely at them and find some way of incorporating them into potential changes to the legislation governing the current child support scheme. There is no quick fix to the current system. Now that we are in government, the coalition has the opportunity, and indeed the responsibility and the obligation, to change the system for the better. In conclusion, I encourage all members to act on this matter with a certain degree of urgency.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="2751"><TITLE>Child Care</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the time of the March 1996 federal election there were half a million children in Commonwealth supported child care and about 70,000 employees in this sector. Under Labor, there had been a 500 per cent increase in the number of Commonwealth funded long day care places made available to Australian families. Our objective had been to improve the affordability, quality and supply of child&hyphen;care places in this country. This was very important because the reality of life in the 1980s and 1990s is that families increasingly include two breadwinners. In the main, for women to work, child care is essential. Commonwealth subsidised and Commonwealth regulated child care is essential in helping families to cope with the need and the desire to work. Commonwealth involvement in the provision of child care has also played an essential part in enabling women to gain access to the workplace on a more equal footing with men.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By contrast we saw, in the Howard government's first budget, over $500 million taken from child care. In an attempt to conceal the severity of its attack on child care, these cuts have been applied in a number of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2752"> different areas and, in my view, have been calculated to take effect over a staggered period of time to try and confuse parents about the impact of the cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first of these cuts will take effect from 1 April. One of these is the reduction in child care assistance payments to a maximum of 50 hours a week. This is to be debated as a disallowable instrument in the Senate tomorrow. Labor will oppose this change in the Senate but I expect that it will go through. This is despite the repeated representations from a large number of child&hyphen;care providers who have made their views very well known to the minister and to the government. The problem with the cap is that, to provide maximum flexibility to parents, most centres are open for, and charge for, 60 hours a week. Now the cost of the extra 10 hours will be added to family budgets. This will impact hard on all family budgets, but especially on those of lower income families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has been provided with numerous examples of the impact of the cut but so far has refused to be moved. I would like to put a few of the examples of this cut on the record. The Woodridge child&hyphen;care centre in Logan City, Queensland says that 22 families at the centre will have increases ranging from $14.40 to $31.30 per week. The Roma kindergarten and day care centre in Roma, Queensland will have fee increases in excess of $30 a week. The Alexandra Hills `Busy Bee' child&hyphen;care centre in Alexandra Hills, Queensland says that families receiving maximum assistance&mdash;in other words, those with the lowest incomes&mdash;will suffer the highest rises while families on higher incomes will experience smaller disadvantages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A woman working as a library clerk in Jagajaga, who actually resides in your electorate of Scullin, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, is a single parent working full time. Her child&hyphen;care fees at the RMIT child&hyphen;care centre have gone from $93.20 to $138 a fortnight. Her child is disabled and attends another centre for the rest of the time. As this is a community based centre, the fees are set to rise again in July, when operational subsidies cease. She also has to pay extra for family day care three times a month when she works at night.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Regency Road child&hyphen;care centre in Adelaide gives the example of a sole parent working full time, with two children in care, who will have an extra $42.20 to pay. The centre makes the telling point that her fortnightly family tax initiative of $34.60 will not even cover one week of the increase in her child&hyphen;care fees. The Sanctuary Farm centre in Penfield, South Australia, gives a similar example of a working sole parent with two children in care who will have to pay $41.70 per week more. Sanctuary Farm gives other examples of parents, one working in a shop and another a delivery driver, who cannot afford to stop working and so they take their children to work with them. This centre also makes the following point:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government promised Affordable, Quality Child Care for all, and not just affordable for the wealthy. This is an investment in the future of Australia, the early years of children are so important, and they deserve the best whether parents work or not. These changes are going to hurt the average battler and that's NOT FAIR.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">These are only a sample of the many letters we have had that explain the effect of just of the government's cuts in child care from the last budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the largest cuts was the removal of operational subsidies to community based long day care centres. These centres pioneered the provision of child care in many areas and the operational subsidy enabled them to provide care of a high quality. The government has provided a small amount of funding to these centres so that they can hire consultants to help them, as the government terms it, to restructure. Most of this advice could be summarised in the following way: reduce staff; make parents carry more of the costs, like bringing their own food and nappies; amalgamate; charge more; or close. All of these options involve a reduction in quality of service and usually an increase in cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Still to make an impact&mdash;but this will come very soon&mdash;are the effects of the freeze on indexation of child care assistance payments, the abolition of the additional income allowed for dependent children when assessing eligibility for child care assistance, and the reduction of child care cut&hyphen;offs for second and subsequent children. All of these changes will 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2753"> impact on families' capacity to afford child care from 1 April this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also the case that the government proposes to make child care assistance payments direct to parents. We have available to us a survey by Roy Morgan Research for the Department of Social Security. The survey goes through all the reasons why parents oppose this change. Family day care providers, in particular, have major concerns with this scheme. The Kempsey family day care centre&mdash;I think you will see there are concerns all over Australia&mdash;said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This change will cause chaos for schemes and families using care.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Age </EMPHASIS> in Melbourne carried an article commenting on some of the effects of the cuts to child care. The report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Child care centres have reported unprecedented falls in demand for hours of care, raising concerns about women being forced out of the workforce by Federal Government child care cuts.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The article also mentions that: </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both private and community-based centres have suggested families are either being forced to use informal child care, such as neighbours or relatives, or face reducing their work hours to avoid increasing child care costs.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Now we have received copies of government documents that show that this government, in its 1997 budget, is proposing to cut another $400 million from child care. This is before child&hyphen; care providers, or the families using child care, have had a chance to even absorb the cuts from the 1996 budget into their family budgets before they are confronted with cuts in this coming budget of a similar magnitude. We do not know where these cuts are going to fall, but we do know for sure that they are going to fall on families' budgets. What is very clear is that this government has no commitment to child care. It is a conservative government, in the truest sense of the word, because when they talk about family values they are talking about some sort of family that existed in the 1950s&mdash;a family that does not need two income earners. The government does not recognise that the vast majority of women these days want to work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cuts to child care in the 1997 budget will not be the end of the matter. It is quite 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> clear that this government's aim is to slice away at child care until there is nothing left. It is absolutely essential that all child care&hyphen; providers, parents and other Australians wake up to this government's plans and make them stop before our system of family&hyphen;friendly child care is lost completely.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="2753"><TITLE>Tariffs</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 13 March in Melbourne, the Centre for Independent Studies hosted a tribute to the late Bert Kelly, former member for Wakefield in the Federal Parliament. Speakers on this occasion were Paul Kelly, international editor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> , former Prime Minister, the honourable Gough Whitlam, the honourable David Kemp, Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, Ray Evans, President of the H.R. Nicholls Society, John Hyde, former executive director of the Institute of Public Affairs, and the meeting was chaired by the honourable Jim Carlton, former minister for health and the former member for Mackellar.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those speakers paid a tribute to the career and contribution of Bert Kelly for his lone stand against the protectionist sentiment of the day symbolised by the Country Party leader, Black Jack McEwan. History records that Bert Kelly won his lonely and courageous struggle in a time when&mdash;as Australia's political leaders have now come to recognise on a bipartisan basis; that is, this side of the House and the Labor Party&mdash;protection, via tariffs and import quotas, was destructive, wasteful, and ultimately failed to provide security even to the very industries it was supposed to assist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The present debate over the future levels of protection for the automobile and textile, clothing and footwear industries has seen a very legitimate argument about the timing and speed of further reductions in tariffs. But one of the most unfortunate aspects of the present debate has been the re-emergence of protectionist thinking, the view that by protecting local industries through tariffs we can protect jobs, secure industries and enhance the national wealth. As Paul Kelly made the point at Bert Kelly's tribute, there is now a generation of politicians, journalists, opinion leaders and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2754"> policy makers, who have never heard of Alf Rattigan or Bert Kelly, and have no knowledge of Australia's long and sorry association with the protectionist experiment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Labor Party, in calling for a freeze on car tariffs at 15 per cent, claim they are not going back to the bad old days of protection. Numerically, they are not&mdash;15 per cent is still a lot less than the effective rates of protection of over 100 per cent in the early 1980s. But in terms of the arguments they employ, their defence of a 15 per cent tariff is exactly the same as the arguments employed to defend the massive protection of the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We hear the claim that a tariff freeze will protect jobs, that it will provide certainty, that it will lead to greater investment and that it will secure the future of the car industry. If all this were true and tariff protection really could achieve all these things, then by 1990, after 70 years of high tariff and quota protection, Australia would have had the best car industry in the world. Reducing Australia's high manufacturing tariffs was always in Australia's interest, even if it happened unilaterally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the context of the present debate, there have been calls for Australia to halt tariff reduction on the grounds that other countries are not reducing their levels of protection at the same pace. The first point about this is that it is not entirely true. Average global tariffs have fallen from around 40 per cent in the 1940s to around 5 per cent today. Organisations like the GATT and the World Trade Organisation have ensured that tariffs have fallen, quotas are being phased out and trade rules are made more transparent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point is that Australia has always been a leader in forums like the GATT and APEC because we realised, as a small exporting nation, there were benefits in reducing our levels of protection unilaterally. Irrespective of what the rest of the world was doing, lowering protection made sense for Australia because protection diverted resources away from productive, wealth&hyphen;creating industries towards less efficient sectors. The price of protection was borne by our wealth-creating exporters who paid more for their 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> utes, harvesters, trucks and cars, as well as facing an over-priced exchange rate and inflated award wages set in the protected metal trades sector. The most heavily protected industries were shedding jobs the fastest and protection for selected sectors created the impression that the government was in the business of providing special favours to sectional interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By lowering protection, the Hawke and Keating governments accepted the intellectual argument that tariffs were not in Australia's interests. In fact, high tariffs had damaged the very industries they were meant to protect. In 1997, we see a return to the protectionist line of argument, even if the rates of tariff are not as high as in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Hotham (Mr Crean), who has sold out, has referred to further tariff reduction as `unilateral disarmament'. Among the loudest adherents to this neo-protectionist sentiment has been former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser. In his newspaper column in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> and a series of letters to the editor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, Mr Fraser has attacked the notion that Australia can reduce our levels of protection while other nations fail to reduce theirs. Mr Fraser's position is based on the mercantilist view of the world, a doctrine very much in favour in 17th century Great Britain before the time of Adam Smith. That view had it that the ideal trading position of any country was to export significant amounts and to import as little as possible. In doing so, a nation could store up enormous reserves of gold bullion which would make them, by definition, very rich. The flaw in the argument was that it failed to take account of the fact that trade is a two&hyphen;way street&mdash;imports and exports go together. Mr Fraser fails to understand that fact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In one letter to the editor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, he asked whether supporters of free trade would still support low levels of protection in Australia, even if trade barriers overseas meant we could export nothing. Of course, if we could export nothing, we would have no ability to import. There would be no need for Mr Fraser's high tariff barriers then.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Fraser seems to think that it would be possible for Australia to export nothing yet 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2755"> import considerable amounts. Conversely, he believes it possible for Australia to export significantly but import nothing&mdash;an outcome he would presumably regard as a sound economic policy. That outcome would be neither feasible nor desirable. If we export nothing, we can import nothing, and vice versa.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since 1965, Australia has experienced massive growth in both imports and in exports. Moreover, during the period when Australia has lowered its trade barriers, the share of manufacturing production which has been exported has risen from 15 per cent in 1968 to 22 per cent in 1992, and continues to climb. So Australia has improved its standard of living by importing and exporting and improving both those sectors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was Adam Smith who pointed out the mercantilist folly and championed the cause of specialisation and free trade. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the maxim of every prudent master of a family never to make at home what it will cost him more to make than to buy. The tailor does not attempt to make his own shoes but always buys them off the shoemaker. The shoemaker does not attempt to make his own clothes but employs a tailor. The farmer attempts to make neither one nor the other . . . What is prudence in the conduct of every private family can scarce be folly in that of a great kingdom. If a foreign country can supply us with a commodity cheaper than we ourselves can make it, better to buy it of them with some part of the produce of our own industry, employed in a way in which we have some advantage.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">A family which made its own clothes, made its own food, built its own house, educated its own children and administered health care to its own members could not possibly enjoy the standard of living which most Australians enjoy simply by specialising in what they do best and buying goods and services from others. That fundamental truth has been overlooked by the Labor Party on the other side.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia in 1997 has countless areas of expertise and comparative advantage. Our wool, wheat, gold, beef, iron ore, tourism, education, high-tech manufacturing and dairy and sugar industries are the world's most competitive. In the car industry, our six&hyphen;cylinder upper medium cars, like Ford and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Commodore, have maintained strong market share because of our relative expertise in this model&mdash;the market share of imports in the six&hyphen;cylinder range is as low as 1.5 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be sheer lunacy to believe that a small country like that of Australia, with a population of 18 million, could possibly be self&hyphen;sufficient in the whole range of goods and services which Australians require and desire. In fact, most of our industries have massive large scale production and only small domestic markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are totally reliant on the export market and world trade to provide us with the income to finance our lifestyle. Those exports are significant and they continue to grow as world trade barriers fall. The suggestion that we are being swamped by low cost imports from low wage Asian nations is totally debunked by the fact that Australia runs substantial trade surpluses with virtually all our Asian trading partners like Japan, Korea, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Hong Kong and Taiwan. No country has more to gain from free trade than Australia, and we should be the last country on earth to believe that self-imposed trade barriers would be good for us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer) has done an admirable job, as the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr McGauran), who is at the table, would understand, in seeking market access for Australian exporters of wool into Mexico, beef and cars into Taiwan, wool into Korea, milk into Malaysia, sugar into Egypt, wheat into the Middle East, coal and wool into India, sugar into the US, legal services into China, beef and hides into Bulgaria and poultry into Hong Kong. Australia is a nation which relies on free trade for its economic prosperity like no other nation on earth. To allow the new protectionist language to find its way into our trade policies would be sheer economic folly at a time when we can scarcely afford to hamper our productive performance.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="2755"><TITLE>Ships of Shame</TITLE>

Ltd, of Piraeus, Greece. Polembros Maritime Co. has a shabby record around the world for its harsh treatment of crews and its operation of aged vessels. The motor vessel <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hunter</EMPHASIS>  is a classic case of a ship of shame, not so much as to the substandard condition of the vessel but rather as a case of the infamous mistreatment of crew.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 12 January 1997, the motor vessel <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hunter</EMPHASIS> arrived off Newcastle from China to load 70,000 tonnes of coal for Chile. After that arrival, the crew members made complaints to the International Transport Federation and to the Maritime Union of Australia about mistreatment and non-payment of wages. Polembros then initiated action against Port Waratah Coal Services, the International Transport Federation, the Maritime Union of Australia and the Newcastle Port Corporation when the ship was denied entry and denied access to the coal loader. The coal loader said, `Fix your problems, whatever they are, and then we will give you a berth.' The Newcastle Port Corporation, as I understood it, recognised the decision of the coal loader. The ITF and the MUA, as they are properly entitled to do, were acting on behalf of the crew members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the very first action initiated under section 45D of the new industrial legislation&mdash;I am shorthanding it&mdash;under section 45D of the Trade Practices Act and 45E, which has been reinstated therein by this government, was an action by a foreign corporation out of London in respect of a ship that is really a ship of shame, a ship with a multiracial crew, a ship which is 20 years of age and a ship on which the crew were being denied proper payment and were not being accorded proper treatment. The action was by this foreign corporation against Australian unions, the Newcastle Port Corporation and the Port Waratah Coal Services in an attempt to stop the unions acting on behalf of the crew to gain their proper entitlements and to be treated properly under international con 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ventions to which this government and this country subscribe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, put very briefly, the first use of Australia's revised industrial legislation under this government was by a foreign corporation using it to seek to evade its international obligations in respect of sea safety and crew treatment to which obligations under international maritime conventions, international maritime regulations, this country subscribes and has been a very, very strong supporter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 21 January at 1 a.m. one of the crew members, Rommel Salvadore Escalante&mdash;desperate because the union ashore had been refused permission to come out to the anchored ship and interview crew members about their grievances&mdash;went over the side of the ship. He took with him a life jacket, a lifebuoy and a small dinghy, and sought to reach shore. He did not reach shore.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At 9.46 a.m. the following day, some 8&frac34; hours later, his disappearance was reported to shore authorities. At 10.15 a.m. he was sighted 2.5 nautical miles to the south of the ship suffering from hypothermia. As the rescuers said, another half hour and he would have been dead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Time does not permit me to go into all the detail I want to. It requires much longer to go through and detail everything that has happened in respect of this. This is an infamous case of a foreign corporation exploiting its crew members and using, as I have said, Australian law to seek to evade its international obligations in respect of crew treatment and ship safety.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I called for an investigation to be made by the Panamanian government into the circumstances on board that vessel at that time which led to the crew member going over the side in that way, risking his life and almost losing his life in a desperate attempt to take information ashore on what was happening on board the ship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An investigation was carried out by the Panamanian government representative in Australia, Aubrey Wise. The investigation was a farce. He interviewed three people: Captain Georgios Kourtessis, the master; Captain Georgiadis Nikos, the chief officer or chief 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2757"> mate on board the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hunter</EMPHASIS>; and Rommel Salvadore Escalante, the man who went over the side and who is of Honduran origin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have the details in front of me. It is a one&hyphen;page summary. That is the report&mdash;one page. Mr Wise did not ask any of the other crew members, even though they were readily available, about the conditions on board the vessel or about any of the circumstances. He gave to Escalante, the man concerned, an A4 sheet of paper with 17 questions set out upon it, leaving half a line or a line to fill in all of the circumstances. I have read that information, but I do not have time to read through all of it here. I will just give you the nature of it. In the summary, Mr Wise says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rommel Salvadore Escalante floated around the ship until he was picked up by a Helicopter shortly before 1015 hours on the 21st. January 1997 and was taken to Newcastle Hospital. He was treated and allowed to leave. He also visited Burns Philp &amp; Co. Ltd.'s doctor a few days later.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What really happened was that he was picked up by the launch and rushed to hospital by the helicopter when he was brought ashore. As soon as he came out of hospital, he was arrested by Immigration officers as an illegal immigrant and taken to a police station. That was the ultimate farce in all of this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fortunately, we were able to persuade Immigration&mdash;who were quite helpful&mdash;that this was not somebody trying to enter Australia illegally. He was somebody trying to have his grievances on board this hell ship addressed. We managed to fix it up. This report says he:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . floated around the ship&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The first page of the report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At about 1015 hours on the 21st. January 1997 Harbour Control reported to the ship that the missing seaman had been picked up about 2.5 nautical miles away from the ship and was now safe ashore.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not have time to go through the detail of that, as I have said, but the conditions on board that ship are an example of what we are going to see more of. The Minister for Trans 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> port and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) will be reading what I am saying now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am looking at the transcript of the minister's interview on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PM</EMPHASIS> on 12 March 1997. When the reporter asked him about this case, the minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was fought in the courts, and of course the people on board the vessel won the day and got their back pay and got their work conditions improved as a result of it.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They did not win the case. The case was settled out of court on undisclosed terms. The reporter said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Only really after somebody risked their life by jumping overboard though.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well certainly. I mean, dramatic action had to take place for it to be brought to the attention of authorities, there's no doubt of that. It would have been better if that same person had made contact, as they could have, with the appropriate authorities and told them of their problems before they decided to jump into the water and try and swim for it.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They had done that through the local authorities and the union, but the union had been denied permission to come on board and get further information to enable action to be taken in respect of it. Then the minister went on and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The only action a union needs to take in these circumstances is not to go on strike&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Nobody went on strike. There was no industrial action. The minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The only action a union needs to take in these circumstances is not to go on strike but to inform the Australian Maritime Safety of their concerns and get the Australian Maritime Safety to take the appropriate action. You don't need a strike to solve these sorts of problems.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As I said, there was no strike.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The important point to make is that the Australian Maritime Safety Authority do not have the power to deal with circumstances like this. They have the power to inspect vessels. They have the power to detain vessels. They have the power to detain vessels where crew accommodation is not up to the international standards required. But they do not have the power to act in respect of unpaid wages and denial of medical care. They do not have the power in those respects. So the minister is just plain wrong.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2758">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask the minister to look at all the circumstances of this event and bear in mind that, in this case, the issue should be taken up in the strongest possible terms with the Panamanian government with a view to ensuring that ships wearing the Panamanian flag adhere to the international obligations they have under international maritime conventions, and with a view to ensuring that the Panamanian government itself carries out its obligations by ensuring that ships registered under its flag meet the requirements and the obligations it is required to ensure they meet. So the Panamanian government has a responsibility, and the ship operators have a responsibility. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="2758"><TITLE>Oceans Policy</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to speak on the coalition government's ocean policy and the effects it will have on my electorate of Gilmore. The oceans, seas and coasts of this continent hold a special place in the hearts, history and future of all Australians, nowhere more than in the electorate of Gilmore. For too long, government activity concerning our oceans and coasts has been ad hoc and disjointed with the resulting wastage of resources and less than optimal outcomes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After one year in power the coalition will do what the ALP promised but could not do in 13 years. The promises of the previous government are perfectly illustrated by their announcement two years ago&mdash;at Kiama in my electorate&mdash;of a coastal care program with expenditure of $42 million. Did we ever see that? No. In contrast, this government has already spent in excess of $150,000 on coastal care programs in Gilmore, with bushland restoration at Jervis Bay, erosion control at Cudmirrah Beach, rehabilitation of the Bolong wetlands, regeneration of Rocklow Creek wetlands and bitou bush control at Lake Conjola, Narrawallee and Culburra. There have been no promises from this government; there has just been action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's oceans policy will give Australia an integrated and strategic platform for better management of our coasts and oceans and, in so doing, will give those in Gilmore greater reason to look towards a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> brighter future. It will provide us with a basis for identifying opportunities and promoting economic development of our marine resources and will give us the means to conserve the natural environment of our oceans and to develop the industries and communities that they support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people of Gilmore are well aware of how important our coast and adjacent waters are for tourism and recreation. They are also well aware of how important tourism and recreation are to the future of Gilmore. Total direct expenditure by tourists for the year 1995&hyphen;96 in the city of Shoalhaven&mdash;which contains some of our coastline&mdash;was $227 million, generating some 5,700 jobs. This was up from $157 million in 1985&hyphen;86, just 10 years previously. Tourism spending supports larger shopping centres, thereby giving residents a greater range of choice than would otherwise be possible. Tourists demand and are supplied with entertainment facilities which the local population could not support. Tourists fall in love with the area and settle there, thereby boosting the population. Tourists can also be industrialists who eventually set up businesses there, thereby creating new work opportunities. Tourists create a demand for primary products, thereby making farms more viable. The list goes on and on. So, if, through our oceans policy, we can maintain and even improve our most important tourist attractions&mdash;which are the seas and coastline&mdash;then we are certainly on the right track.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will give a brief overview of the Gilmore electorate and, as I do, the importance of the relationship between the coastline of the electorate and our future will become apparent. My considerable experience in the tourism industry permits me to comment on the incredible beauty of Gilmore's coastline. The Australian beach is one of the best known images overseas, and Gilmore has some of the most spectacular coastline in New South Wales&mdash;and, for that matter Australia. As the crow flies, we have 160 kilometres of coast&mdash;from Kiama in the north, through the crown jewel that is Jervis Bay, down to sleepy Bawley Point and North Durras in the south. There are 109 beaches, many of which are deserted and many of which are surrounded 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2759"> by state forest, only accessible by four&hyphen;wheel drive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Jervis Bay is&mdash;to my mind and that of many others&mdash;one of the greatest natural wonders of the nation. More and more, it is proving to be one of the greatest attractions on the New South Wales south coast. Beneath the surface of the water lies a veritable treasure trove of marine life, sustaining a fragile marine culture and providing incredible scuba diving. I recently had the pleasure of attending the launch on Jervis Bay of a new purpose&hyphen;built scuba diving vessel. The vessel <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Avalon</EMPHASIS> was launched by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, John Sharp, and will take people scuba diving in Jervis Bay. This vessel represents another major investment in the tourism industry out of Huskisson on to Jervis Bay and is typical of the sort of investment that will take place in Gilmore as long as we can guarantee the quality and attraction of our oceans and coastline.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a delicate balance that makes up a very important ecosystem, Jervis Bay is flanked by a magnificent national park. Only if we maintain this delicate balance and protect our marine environment from pollution and pests will the full benefits from commercial development of our ocean resources be available. Eighty per cent of marine pollution comes from the land, and the oceans policy will canvass this major issue in an attempt to reduce pollutants and minimise the impact of uncoordinated coastal development. Providing we are successful in containing pollution, it is hoped that Jervis Bay will provide the basis for ocean medicine and food cultivation in future years&mdash;and even some emerging industry opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The resource base of our oceans is vast. They have enormous potential for developing in ways that are only just emerging. The majority of anti&hyphen;cancer drugs currently being tested are derived from marine organisms and Australia's marine biological diversity has the potential to add great value to the pharmaceutical industry. This government supports innovative and responsible industrial use of oceans, and the possibilities for Gilmore are 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> limitless&mdash;as long as they can coexist with essential environment values.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the southern extremity of Gilmore is Ulladulla, which is the centre of its own subregion and also the centre of an important commercial fishing industry. With its oceans policy, the government recognises the importance of the commercial fishing industry and also the scale of recreational fishing: a large proportion of the population&mdash;including many people who live in or visit Gilmore&mdash;fish for pleasure every year. There are many pressures on our fish resources, and we must manage them carefully and meet our obligations to protect them. We must not fish out our stocks or irreparably damage their habitat. To meet the growing demand for fish, we must make better use of the fish we catch. To meet the growing demand from recreational fishermen, we must better manage our marine environment and preserve our magnificent coastline.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The wildlife on the south coast of New South Wales is as much an attraction for tourists as it is elsewhere in Australia. Tourists and locals alike are often known to share a beach or a golf fairway with kangaroos, and visitation to Jervis Bay to see dolphins and penguins has increased markedly. Acknowledging the importance of our flora and fauna,  the government has made a concentrated effort to protect one of the most beautiful birds in the world&mdash;the albatross. Many thousands of albatross are killed each year by fishing practices which can be modified. To protect them internationally, the government has nominated 11 species of albatross and has extended the requirements for tori poles&mdash;which have been mandatory on domestic long&hyphen;line fishing vessels&mdash;to cover foreign long&hyphen;line fishing vessels as well. These tori poles reduce the incidental catch of albatross. These, in addition to regional conservation agreements, should reduce the threats faced by the albatross, saving them from becoming seriously endangered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the most important aspects of the Gilmore coastline is the lack of human development&mdash;and quite often a lack of humans themselves. This lack of development, in addition to the government's oceans policy, augurs well for the retention of our fragile 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2760"> ecosystem, thereby allowing the coastline to remain in its pristine state. If&mdash;through our own efforts and those of the government oceans policy&mdash;we can maintain the quality of our coastline, we are geographically positioned to take the greatest advantage of the major urban areas and the potential tourists that live there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At this stage, the only limiting factor to the growth and development of Gilmore is transport. If we have the product which is the attraction&mdash;that is the beaches and the coastline&mdash;it would be a terrible shame to continue to hinder the tourist's ability to visit them by not improving our infrastructure. It is imperative that our road system is capable of carrying tourists to and from destinations quickly. For Gilmore, that means the completion of Main Road 92 from Nowra to Canberra and the continued improvement of the Princes Highway south from Sydney. Currently, the coast is not easily accessible for the people of the ACT. At this stage, it is necessary to drive down the Clyde to Bateman's Bay or down the  Kangaroo Valley Road, which takes in the vicinity of three hours. Those in the House who are familiar with these two roads know that Kangaroo Valley is notorious for its traffic hold&hyphen;ups and is very dangerous indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With Main Road 92 we would see the ACT market of over 400,000 people located just 1&half; hours from an area for which over the years they have already shown an affection. For every one per cent increase in tourism visitation $3.36 million per annum is injected into the economy, creating 57 full&hyphen;time jobs. The construction of Main Road 92 would allow the Kangaroo Valley Road to be reclassified as a tourist route. It would facilitate a major tourist loop including Sydney, the Southern Highlands, the ACT and the coasts and oceans of the Shoalhaven.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, Main Road 92 would allow the easy access required by HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Albatross</EMPHASIS> to Canberra for embassy liaisons and to provide a strategic defence link. Most importantly, the construction of this road would provide quick, easy and safe access to all the coastal attractions that the Gilmore electorate naturally has. With Sydney only two hours north and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Canberra two hours west it is up to us then to promote ourselves to get a fair share of the burgeoning tourist dollar. With 58 per cent of our tourists coming to the Shoalhaven from either Sydney or Canberra and 54 per cent coming for the beaches and waterways, it is easy to see the association between the oceans policy and these two most important roads.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said previously, we in Gilmore are lucky to have a coastline that is almost untouched. However, this is not so for the coastline of Australia in general. Australia's coastline is one of the most dynamic parts of the landscape and is extremely fragile, yet it represents the most heavily populated portion of the continent, with most development centred on or within 100 kilometres of the coast. It therefore requires strict and ongoing management to ensure that the many conflicting demands placed upon it do not irrevocably interfere with the landscape, a challenge that is adequately met by this government's ocean policy, an ocean policy that covers transport and tourism, science and technology, and from resources and energy to fisheries and environmental management. It is of great importance to my electorate of Gilmore.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="2760"><TITLE>Crime Syndicates</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a speech that I wish someone else would make but it is unlikely that they will. On 5 February this year I put out a press release which dealt with the Police Commissioner of New South Wales, Peter Ryan, who had made a statement saying that New South Wales had an ethnic crime problem. He was immediately confronted by politicians and told not to make statements like this. The truth quite clearly was being suppressed by the politicians for whatever reason. The commissioner has said that he has brought out a code of ethics for the behaviour of police. I think this is a very desirable element but Commissioner Ryan has to realise that allowing himself to be suppressed by politicians is probably not ethical for someone in his position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the situation gets a lot worse. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 9 March Sergeant Craig made some statements. Sergeant Craig cannot be ignored. He is an FBI trained sergeant and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2761"> an intelligence analyst with the Queensland Police Service. He warns that Australia will also experience a significant rise in money laundering, extortion and drug trafficking. He believes Chinese organised crime syndicates will fast become the biggest threat to law enforcement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure that Sergeant Craig will also be suppressed and we are unlikely to hear any more from Sergeant Craig. He will simply be told not to make statements like this, no matter how true they are. He mentioned that the syndicates and the Fukien are organising crime throughout the world, not just in Australia. He said there is a big involvement in random kidnapping, heroin trafficking and smuggling of illegal immigrants through North America and western Europe. We have seen recently that it also occurs in Japan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might say to this House that from time to time we get boat people impacting on my electorate. There is a great song and dance that goes up about this and I believe we should be taking much more care and having much closer surveillance of that coastline. It is unrealistic to think that we are any different from other countries. I assert that the great number of illegal immigrants are coming in through the eastern seaboard, principally through Sydney, and they are disappearing into Cabramatta.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a Chinese friend who tells me that the suggestion of 100,000 illegal immigrants is simply a joke; he says the situation is probably closer to 400,000. He said the government must know this and is simply powerless to act. I believe there is a lot of substance in what he is saying. When I get a chance I will be reading into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> a letter he has recently written me. I think it is a letter which would interest all Australians. In organised crime sometimes the people who suffer most are the ethnic communities themselves. The small business people know they are being extorted by the organised crime of other ethnics. It is not Australians doing this; it is their own organised crime and we appear to be quite powerless to intervene.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You see the sort of thing you are dealing with in political correctness gone crazy. I see in a local Victorian paper, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yarra Leader</EMPHASIS>, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that Senior Detective Mark Davis, a squad member of the Asian squad, was saying how wrong it was to suggest that there was more crime in these ethnic communities than elsewhere. But there is more crime there; there is absolutely no doubt about that. I had one of my associates ring up the police to query this and was told, `Look, you know the score; we are under a lot of pressure to make these sorts of statements.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the police, particularly those in Victoria and Queensland, have been warning for some time about this problem and they are being ignored by the politicians. At the end of the day it is the politicians who must accept responsibility for the fact that nothing is done about this. Let me give you a little more political correctness. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald&hyphen;Sun</EMPHASIS> of the 20th of this month talks about the Victorian police name change. It has been decided that Victorian police will now not describe by the old method people who commit crimes&mdash;they had I think up to 14 different categories. Now people will be described only as Aboriginal, Caucasian or other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apparently, this was at the behest of the Arabic community, who objected to people being described as from the Middle East. They said it was unfortunate when they turned out not to be of Middle Eastern origin. I am sure it was. It does not seem to matter at all that Anglo-Celtic Australia now goes under a whole list of Caucasians. No matter what the origin of the person committing the crime, it will be indicated that it was an Anglo-Celtic Australian committing it when in fact that is not the case. What is wrong with the police being able to define these people? If they want to put out a description, is it not better to put out an accurate description than a non-accurate description?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is some suggestion that they will just publish photographs. Of course they do publish photographs or identikits, and that is going to tell the story. Why don't we simply say, `Yes, you can be honest. You can describe these people with the description that best fits them'? I do not see any problem in that. It is interesting to note that, in a poll done by a newspaper, 95.3 per cent of people came out against this new political correct 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2762"> ness. The great overwhelming majority of the population felt it was unnecessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am concerned about this because, if nothing is done about it, it is going to reach a point where the community takes action on its own account. No-one will be able to blame the community; the fault will rest entirely with the politicians who are so politically correct and so afraid of facing up to these facts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite clear that the Japanese are now being confronted with a large invasion of illegal immigrants organised by organised crime. It is also quite clear that that is happening in Australia. Go back to the days when Al Grassby was the minister for immigration. The immigration department actually said to Mr Grassby as minister, `We have these business migration applications here. We recommend you do not approve them as we think they have association with organised crime.' Al Grassby approved every one of them. I will warrant that that is how the Triads got established in Australia. No-one can deny that they are established now. It is no good pussyfooting around.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have an article here which says that the Vietnamese community in Melbourne is concerned that overwhelmingly people convicted of drug offences in Victoria are Vietnamese. The Vietnamese community are concerned about this, and well they should be. Most of them are law abiding citizens, but they know that they are going to get caught up in this backlash. Something simply has to be done about it, and it will not be done in the present system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have said for a long time that drugs are a problem that could be fixed. They are not fixed simply because no-one will tackle the real problem&mdash;that is, the vast amount of money that is involved and the corruption that this ensures. We could do something about drugs if we had the political will. The sensible thing would be to legalise and control the drugs, to increase the penalty for supplying them outside the system and, therefore, take away the profit margin. It could be squeezed at both ends if you made them available at a price people could afford without robbing service stations.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let's face it: it might sound callous, but I do not particularly care if drug addicts kill themselves with drugs. That is their problem. The truth is that far more women in Australia die from analgesic overdoses than die from heroin overdoses. But who cares about that? Why don't we care? Because they do not go out and rob chemist shops and service stations; they die nice and quietly with kidney failure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we were serious about this, we could make drugs available on prescription, which, I think, would be sanction enough. We could increase the penalties for supplying them outside; we could destroy the market. We do not catch the big drug dealers. They simply go away. Mr Deputy Speaker, if I had more time I would give some horrific anecdotal stories, some of which are quite substantiated, in relation to the corruption involved in this trafficking.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="2762"><TITLE>Guns: Safety Demonstrations

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset, I would like to advise the parliament that, on Wednesday of this week, 26 March, in committee room 1R1 at 10.45 a.m. and 11.45 a.m., there will be safety demonstrations of a new gun safety product which has been developed in my electorate by James Griffiths and Michael Steel. They have developed the safe&hyphen;tech firearm locking system, which provides a valuable enhanced system of gun control and safety for weapons through an electronic locking system operated by a PIN. I am delighted that the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) is in the chamber this afternoon because I am sure he will be personally very interested in the system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the weapon is stolen, the thief cannot operate it because he has not got the PIN. I will not go through all of the valid points in favour of it, but, in terms of police safety, the firearm, when activated, produces a signal which can be monitored by police radio receivers. Police in the vicinity can deactivate 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2763"> that weapon by a remote switcher in their possession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I encourage all members, senators and people who work in the parliament to visit committee room 1R1 on Wednesday at either 10.45 a.m. or 11.45 a.m. to witness this very interesting development by small business. It is fitting that today the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) launched the government's response to small business. Here is a prime example of Australian initiative and ingenuity tackling a problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to talk about a drug called Fosamax, which is alendronate sodium. Fosamax 40&hyphen;milligram tablets were listed as a pharmaceutical benefit on 1 November 1996 for the treatment of symptomatic Paget's disease of the bone. I must say I am delighted to hear that because I am probably going to end up with it because both my mother and her brother had it. The likelihood is that I might get it too.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not talking about Paget's disease, because it has already been listed. Fosamax 10&hyphen;milligram tablets were listed on 1 February this year for the treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis in patients with fracture due to minimal trauma. That is excellent; that is great. But what we have is a degree of discrimination against men. Most Australians do not realise that males&mdash;not a great many but a significant number&mdash;can also suffer from osteoporosis. The situation is that they are not allowed to get it under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. If you are a women, yes, you can get it. If you are a man, you cannot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to take this opportunity to appeal to the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) to become interested in the process. Of course, it is up to Merck, Sharp and Dohme, the manufacturers, to provide more information to the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee, which, in turn, provides advice to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a male constituent living in Nambucca Heads who has three vertebral compression fractures. Of course, he is not post-menopausal but he needs this drug and he cannot get it. He can get it by paying $100 a month for 30 Fosamax tablets. I would urge 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the minister, the manufacturer, the Drug Evaluation Committee and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee to do what they can jointly to ensure that this very valuable drug is available to males who also suffer from osteoporosis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Cyclone Justin has today been upgraded once more, and I just wanted to mention the effect on the banana industry. The Queensland industry will suffer a 60 per cent loss from now until May and a 30 per cent loss in the six months following. It is likely that prices will rise. I would anticipate that we might get pressure from the major retail chains, Woolworths and Coles, to try to allow some imports in. I would say to Woolworths and Coles that it is strange that when banana prices to growers fall, it is very rare that banana prices fall in the supermarkets. I would like to suggest that in these coming few months, when banana prices will rise, the supermarkets might restrain themselves and not raise the prices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The major concern is that if there is pressure from the retailers to try to import bananas, which would come from Ecuador in South America, this would provide a very substantial risk for the whole of the Australian banana industry. Two absolutely devastating diseases, moko and black sigatoka, are endemic in Ecuador.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had several attempts to have bananas imported. There is danger in relaxing our quarantine and importing bananas from Ecuador or any other place where there is disease. We also have black sigatoka coming from New Guinea into the Torres Strait; we have to very careful there as well. And remember the papaya fruit fly and the cost that that has had to the fruit growing industry, to the government and to the people of Australia, the taxpayers. I wanted to make the point that quarantine has to remain vigilant, and that we as a government must ensure that disease is not imported to destroy the banana industry, which is of such significance to New South Wales and Queensland and which is of growing significance to Carnarvon in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another issue I wish to speak about in this grievance debate is an organisation called 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2764"> DADS: Dads Against Discrimination. It started about 6&half; years ago and is a result of the difficulties experienced following family law court settlements. Every member of this place would have many constituents coming to them and complaining bitterly about the impact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say that DADS is not all male. It has about a 10 per cent female membership. In other words, these are non&hyphen;custodial parents. While it is impossible to generalise&mdash;there are two sides to every story; there is no doubt about that&mdash;they believe that there is a lack of equity for non-custodial parents both in child support and family law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They also make the point that the rights of the child are very important. One of those significant rights is to have an ongoing relationship with both parents. This often becomes very difficult because the custodial parent frequently decides to move far away and the non-custodial parent has almost no contact, except at great expense. They also make the point that, when considering child support, all the income of both parents, including family allowances, should be potentially assessable for child support payments. Whether that is a correct argument or not, I believe it is worth consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final point I want to make is about the service cadet units of this country&mdash;the army, the navy and the air training corps. In my electorate there are, in Coffs Harbour, three excellent cadet corps with the army, TS Vendetta and the air force and in South West Rocks there is TS Culgoa.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a very simple problem which could be solved very easily; it is an off-shoot of the gun legislation. We have these cadet units which train&mdash;and many of them go on into the armed services&mdash;and which, in my area, provide catafalque parties for Anzac Day, for Remembrance Day and a whole range of other things. If I have time, I might even mention some more of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can see no reason why the service rifles&mdash;even if we went back to 303s&mdash;that were totally incapable of being fired could not be provided so that they could continue to do their drill, because it is an integral part of the community. Particularly in my electorate, all 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> these cadet units make a major impact. They have the support of the Sawtell subsection of the Naval Association of Australia. They have the support of the whole community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All we need is for inoperative rifles&mdash;incapable of being fired&mdash;to be made available to the cadet units so they can provide this community service and so they can provide catafalque parties for Anzac Day and be a valuable part of our community. I would like to appeal to the parliament, through the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan), to see whether we might be able to take some action on this so that the cadet units can still conduct their ceremonial drill, which is of great value to all of the community.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the House take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This report reviews the Auditor-General's report No. 31 of 1995-96 into the environmental management of Commonwealth land. The Auditor-General's report was referred to the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts on 27 June 1996 after being tabled on 24 June 1996. The audit examined the environmental management mechanisms of major Commonwealth land managers, including the departments of Defence, Administrative Services, Transport and Regional Development, and Communications and the Arts. The Auditor-General reported estimates of the number of contaminated sites in Australia ranged from 10,000 to 60,000, including unexploded ordnance in military training areas and hazardous substances. With land valued at $7.75 billion it is clearly important that the Commonwealth place sufficient priority on addressing potential health, environmental and financial risks associated with contamination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The audit report made 18 recommendations and overall the committee was pleased with the response of the land managing agencies to the recommendations. However, there were a couple of issues that the committee found needed further consideration. The major recommendation by the Auditor-General called for coordinated and clear Commonwealth policy on contaminated land which could guide land managing entities when dealing with environmental matters such as 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> pollution prevention and site contamination. The Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency initially agreed to the recommendation of the ANAO that it should take responsibility for developing a Commonwealth policy, but its successor&mdash;the Environment Protection Group in what is now known as Environment Australia&mdash;responded that it would not undertake the task due to changes to its priorities following budget reallocation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ANAO regarded the development of such a policy as an important first step in improving the environmental management of Commonwealth land. The committee was disappointed that the policy could not be finalised, particularly since the ANAO found that much of the work had already been completed. The committee believes that there is a requirement for an overarching national policy and recommends that the government reassess the priorities and resources of Environment Australia to develop a Commonwealth policy on the environmental management of Commonwealth land including site contamination, pollution protection and appropriate levels of public disclosure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An associated issue is that of Commonwealth-state cooperation and coordination in the environmental management of Commonwealth land. Commonwealth entities are generally not bound by state environmental legislation, although the departments examined by the audit office maintained that they observed the intent of state and territory legislation. During the inquiry, the states and territories not unexpectedly asserted that the Commonwealth should abide by their laws on the management of contaminated land. The committee did not make a recommendation on this vital issue because the Intergovernmental Committee on Ecologically Sustainable Development is currently working on the resolution of problems caused by the lack of harmonisation in environmental legislation. The committee consequently recommends that the government examine the issue of a Commonwealth policy once it is known what the Commonwealth will have to do to implement the outcomes of the intergovernmental committee.  </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2766">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another issue of concern to the committee was the lack of resources to assess and manage sites with unexploded ordnance contamination. At the time of the audit there were 403 possible UXO contaminated sites in Queensland alone but only one person allocated in that state to assess UXO contamination. This is not adequate or responsible and the ANAO claimed that at current resource levels it will take more than 20 years to complete reports on all currently known UXO sites in Queensland. Of course, other states also have UXO contaminated sites. In fact there are over 1,000 sites in Australia. The committee recommended that the Department of Defence develop a program to identify and assess UXO contamination and allocate more resources in each state to carry out these arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a major land owner, the Commonwealth should pursue best practice in the environmental management of its land, not only to provide a safe and healthy environment but to avoid any future liabilities. This report has provided a useful assessment of the Commonwealth's management of these areas and I would like to thank the committee secretariat and committee members for their role in completing the report: Ian Dundas, Susan Hnatiuk, Helen Collins and particularly Susan Cardell, who is in the chamber and who undertook a lot of the work associated with this report. I commend the report to the House. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too would like to speak to the report of the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts and, by doing so, supplement some of the remarks made by the chairman, the member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss). This is the first time the opportunity has been provided to me to speak on a committee report in this chamber, and I would firstly like to congratulate the staff. They are a very coordinated and hardworking staff, and I congratulate Susan on the report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many members of parliament may be a little misguided when they see the report that has now been tabled, but it is only small in content. I suggest you all read it because there is a lot to say in that report. As the chairman 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> has indicated, the ANAO report that originally began the investigation took from something like September until January&mdash;about five months&mdash;to do and then the House of Representatives passed it on to our committee. I found the report very interesting, particularly where the audit stated in the summary of its document, `Commonwealth entities can make significant cost effective improvements in their environmental performances.' It also stated that there is `no specific legislation that the Commonwealth has on formal policy to guide Commonwealth land management entities'. Of course, that is really the crux of the problem. The Commonwealth authorities have no overall policy for judging how they will or will not treat their contaminated sites.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It became very clear, as the chairman has indicated, in the evidence supplied to us by both local governments and state governments that that is a prime concern across Australia. When we questioned some of those from the Commonwealth area, whether from Defence or wherever, about this, some said, `We are working on it.' I found in the report that even DAS said they have commenced to develop a database on the contaminated sites. Every department we either questioned or spoke to was about to, was commencing, had it under consideration or yes, was in the process of doing that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is really a bit risky from the Commonwealth level to say, `Yes, we are going to look at that in the future,' particularly as the state governments all have in place, whether it is what we would desire to put in practice from the Commonwealth level or not, state planning legislation and environmental protection legislation. As we know, the Commonwealth under section 52 of our constitution is not necessarily guided by what the states tell it to do or not do. That is another problem that we found during the investigation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is necessary that all Commonwealth departments, including GBEs, should be guided by the Commonwealth legislation that is put together, whether by Environment Australia or whoever else the Commonwealth decides will implement the policy. People will tell you through the departments that there are 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2767"> a number of investigations going on at moment. What worries me is that most of those guidelines that are in place are not strictly guidelines; they are just guidelines for organisations to follow. That is a bit of a worry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The chairman has indicated in the report the number of estimated contaminated sites. If we were talking about this 50 years, I would say, `Yes, we have a lot of work ahead of us.' The trouble is that we have been talking about it for over 50 years and we still have a lot of work ahead of us. That is my primary concern. We have to do at the Commonwealth level a lot more than just talk about it. Departments have to acknowledge their responsibilities and, in acknowledging their responsibilities, have also got to be aware that policies and standards need to be implemented which it is an obligation for all departments to follow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the UXOs, which has also been referred to by the chairman, I thought we put very polite language into the report, particularly when we assessed very politely those particular contaminated sites and the one officer, who, the army said, is a major and who has been allocated full time to assess those sites. The audit office claimed in their report that at those current levels it would take more than 20 years to complete reports on the currently known UXO sites in Queensland. If people would like to read about this, I refer them to point 2.65 on page 22 of the report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As indicated, the Local Government Association of Queensland was very concerned about this, but so were the Victorian, New South Wales and Northern Territory governments. Defence is saying that they are providing adequate information, and they keep on saying that. If you remember, the audit office did a report on this in 1986. It has been shown 10 years later, when this report was commenced and completed, that the Department of Defence has only actually assessed something like two sites so far as unexploded ordnance is concerned. I think we should be very aware of that and we should continue to put pressure on the department to comply. I was very interested that we could not go on further into some of the areas we would like 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to regarding mechanisms and environmental systems, because we have been told that a report is going to come down on that. I wait with bated breath for that report. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

This was her first report as lead research officer. Our congratulations should go to Ms Cardell.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The inquiry arose out of the Auditor&hyphen;General's report No. 31 of 1996 entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Environmental Management of Commonwealth Land: Site Contamination and Pollution Prevention</EMPHASIS>, which was tabled in this place on 24 June. The issues that arose out of it largely come as a result of the committee inquiring into how to improve the environmental management of Commonwealth land and at least bringing the Commonwealth more into line with international best practice in terms of land management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to compliment the government departments and the government business enterprises on their willingness to participate in the inquiry. I will talk about some of their contributions later. There was a criticism levelled at the ANAO by the Department of Defence for some of the photographic material included in the report. In effect, the facts were that those photographic items were provided by Defence's own internal audit function and perhaps it shows the considerable opportunity for improved coordination within Defence. They are obviously identifying problem areas and reporting on them, but not always acting upon them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I guess that is something that leads me to comment on the submissions we received from a number of departments. We heard a range of adjectives and `actionspeak', if I 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2768"> could put it that way, that show that departments and government business enterprises are aware of their responsibilities and the need for action. But not all of them were signalling a very genuine commitment to those responsibilities. There are some opportunities there to more formally record those responsibilities through corporate plans and annual reports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that employees and management do take their lead from what the organisation is seen to value through those strategic planning documents and report mechanisms and that more should be done to tangibly express the importance of environmental management of Commonwealth land in those plans so that they flow through into the operational plans of the organisations and so that genuine responsibility is assigned to senior people within those organisations and that their performance is evaluated on whether they are actually achieving things in those areas. I believe there should be some explicit statements included about environmental and land management responsibilities in the ministerial oversight arrangements for government business enterprises. The genesis of that would be through the Commonwealth policy that the report advocates as recommendation 1.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Environment Australia should take the lead in developing such a whole of government framework policy, given its expertise and experience. Environment Australia has shown an ability to be a full contributor when it comes to the land management regimes that it insists upon the private sector and others introducing where Commonwealth land is perhaps threatened or there is a Commonwealth interest, perhaps through world heritage listing or the like.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly they have got some talent in that area, and I would be a strong advocate for them applying it in this respect so that we look after our own house as well as we require those around us to look after theirs. This previous work and learnings is a very good starting position and in fact they have already made some progress, as the committee chairman has mentioned. That work can be quite easily built upon. Environment Australia is well positioned to be informed of what best 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> practice in land management is and then to apply that information to the Commonwealth in managing its own land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not believe it is too much of an onerous task, given that progress has already been made and that data and information is available. As a result, I think Environment Australia should be readily able to incorporate that and act upon that committee recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That policy may well include the applicability of state and local government laws to the Commonwealth and its business enterprises. The evidence provided to the committee suggests that Commonwealth departments and GBEs are fairly relaxed and happy about meeting the ordinary land use planning requirements that others need to comply with. Therefore, I would say: why not make that a requirement and then have the Commonwealth argue its case as to why it should be exempted from those requirements from time to time?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is an important part of recommendation No. 1 that relates to the disclosure of information to the public. The theme seems to be buyer beware&mdash;caveat emptor. That is fine, but if you are not aware that your area was a testing ground for our allies during the Second World War, it is pretty difficult to know to look for unexploded ordnance. I commend the report to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The two committee reports, Nos. 6 and 7, which I have presented today have both domestic and international importance. Report No. 6 deals with the agreement between Australia and Singapore to locate a helicopter squadron at the Army Aviation Centre near Oakey in Queensland. We recommend early ratification of this agreement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Report No. 7 is an omnibus report that examined a number of matters, the most significant being Australia's withdrawal from the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation&mdash;UNIDO&mdash;and a double&hyphen;taxation agreement with Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Oakey agreement covers the location of a Singaporean helicopter squadron at the Army Aviation Centre to conduct helicopter flying training activities, supported by approximately 250 Republic of Singapore Air Force personnel and their dependants, and will include the establishment of purpose built on&hyphen;base facilities at a cost to Singapore of approximately $30 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia regards Singapore as an important regional partner, maintaining a strong bilateral relationship that draws on longstanding shared strategic interests. This relationship also conveys vital strategic, commercial and political benefits. Australia's interest in the security of Singapore and the region as a whole is formally reflected in our membership of the five&hyphen;power defence arrangement. Furthermore, Singapore's defence forces have already made a substantial investment in the construction of facilities at RAAF Base Pearce in Western Australia and have made a significant commitment to the conduct of training at the Shoalwater Bay training area near Rockhampton in Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is widespread support for this agreement amongst the local communities of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Toowoomba and Oakey. Both local councils believe that the presence of the Singaporeans will provide significant economic benefits to the local communities. In addition to the $30 million capital investment, ongoing annual maintenance requirements will be in the vicinity of $5 million per year. The Department of Defence also estimates that a further $9 million per annum will be injected into the local economy through the expenditure of Singaporean salaries in the Oakey&hyphen;Toowoomba area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While local organisations voiced their support for the agreement, the committee was concerned that the provision and coordination of essential services to the Singaporeans, such as housing, health and education, lacked a central focus. We have therefore recommended that a coordinating group, established by the Queensland Department of Premier and Cabinet, facilitate the provision of a single housing coordinating agency and that a plan be developed outlining the provision of essential services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Evidence presented to the committee by three individuals opposed the agreement. We noted, however, that this opposition came from outside the Toowoomba&hyphen;Oakey region and issues raised included concerns over religious allegiance and the stationing and training of foreign troops in Australia. The committee rejects completely any suggestion that the Singaporeans would not be welcome on the basis of race or religious affiliations. We concluded that the evidence presented by the local communities supporting the agreement and the benefits in general to Australia far outweighed these objections.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first issue dealt with in report No. 7 was Australia's withdrawal from UNIDO, initiated by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) in December 1996. Binding treaty action was taken by the minister in this case before a full 15 sitting days had elapsed for parliamentary review of the proposal. We note that, given the time constraints, it was not possible to consult fully with all interested organisations and firms before the decision was made. However, in the report we stressed that consultation ought to have been undertaken before the decision was announced.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2770">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee also acknowledged the significant reforms that have taken place within UNIDO, particularly in the areas of management processes and the reduction of administrative overheads. However, apart from a relatively small number of firms benefiting from our membership of UNIDO, there would be very few other tangible procurement benefits from membership. The honourable member for Lyons (Mr Adams) opposite will present a dissenting view on this issue shortly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the limited time remaining I would like to comment briefly on the double&hyphen;taxation agreement with Vietnam. While the committee supports early ratification of this agreement, I wish to stress that we were concerned over a number of issues. In particular, we were concerned that the consultation between the Australian Taxation Office and professional accounting bodies and the quality of the national interest analysis that accompanied the agreement were less than satisfactory. We were particularly concerned that the NIA not only omitted necessary information but it was also unduly complex and difficult to understand. We made some other comments about banking, insurance, accounting, auditing and commercial services. The honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) will expand on this and other matters shortly. I commend these reports to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to support the agreement to be signed with Singapore to locate a helicopter squadron at the Army Aviation Centre near Oakey in Queensland, as covered in report No. 6 from the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. Because Singapore is a small place, there is very little flying area to allow any training activities to take place, particularly those with helicopters. The agreement gives Singapore an opportunity to get into the training in a much broader way. There will be about 250 air force personnel and their dependants. It will mean the establishment of a purpose built facility alongside the Oakey base. It will cost the Singaporeans about $A30 million and will be a great plus for the local economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Singapore is an important partner and has strong historical strategic, commercial and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> political links to Australia. Australia has a strong interest in the security of Singapore because of its position in the region as a whole. This is reflected in our membership of the five&hyphen;power defence arrangements. Singapore has already made a contribution in Australia with its substantial investment in the construction of facilities at the RAAF base at Pearce in Western Australia and also at the Shoalwater Bay training area in Rockhampton in Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I visited the site during the public hearing to hear first&hyphen;hand what people in the local region thought about the base. The hearing showed very strong support from the local community, who believe that the investment would be extremely beneficial to their local economy. Local government, in particular, saw that it would be an important addition to help the growth of the region around Oakey, as well as Toowoomba. Apart from the $30 million capital investment, there will be an estimated $5 million a year in maintenance and an estimated $9 million a year will come to the people from being spent in the region. There is strong support for this additional input into the local economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One or two concerns were raised about the provision and coordination of essential services for the Singaporeans, such as housing, health and education. The committee has recommended that the Queensland Department of Premier and Cabinet set up a coordinating committee to overcome problems that may come into being.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were three representatives against the proposal, but they appeared to come from outside the local region. They raised a number of issues, including what religion the Singaporeans may be and a concern about stationing and training foreign troops in Australia. This may have been a result of certain murmurings in the community that have been fanned by certain Independent politicians in this place. However, the committee rejected completely any suggestions that the Singaporeans would be unwelcome within Australia because of race or religious affiliations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The dissenting report in report No. 7 was brought down by the Labor members of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2771"> standing committee and the Democrat senator. We believe that the government acted hastily in relation to abandoning the $2.7 million to the UN. The government had set up the Simons review and has not even waited for that to come down before pulling this money out of the budget to this UN development authority. I must add that Australian companies were doing very well out of being able to do very good work overseas, which was adding much to the Australian economy as well. It was very a immature way of doing it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These reports tabled today demonstrate something of the diversity of the work of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. This one package includes an agreement between Australia and Singapore in relation to training helicopter pilots, Australia's withdrawal from UNIDO, a double&hyphen;tax agreement with Vietnam and a mutual legal assistance agreement with Hong Kong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The variety of this work encourages my great admiration for the chair and the committee secretariat for their versatility in dealing with the wide range of treaty agreements that Australia is engaged in. I would particularly like to compliment Peter Stephens and the secretariat and Lieutenant Colonel Craig Evans, who is the first Chief of Army fellow to be seconded to the parliament and who worked on the Oakey agreement regarding training of helicopter pilots from Singapore.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This committee was established because of community concerns about lack of consultation with the parliament and with the community at large before Australia undertook international treaty agreements. The committee has therefore filled a very useful role in that regard. The very fact that dissidents were able to appear on the Oakey agreement and present their views makes the processes of the committee worth while. But there is still evidence to suggest that some Commonwealth government departments have failed to adequately undertake consultation with commu 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> nities before making recommendations that we should be engaged in treaties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An example was the Australian&hyphen;Vietnam tax agreement, which was considered by the committee on this occasion. There had seemingly been no discussion with the professional bodies in Australia who could have provided expert advice. This was a very complex issue, and it was only when the committee drew attention to the fact that there had been this lack of consultation that there was able to be a resolution of some of the issues of concern. The consultation should not be left to the time when the Treaties Committee makes these reviews. It should be a part of the whole development process of drawing up a treaty and coming to a conclusion about whether it is in Australia's interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that there was a minority report in relation to the UNIDO document. It needs to be said that the majority supporters are not claiming that UNIDO is without merit, but the majority of the committee was not persuaded that the government's action in withdrawing from UNIDO was not a reasonable decision in view of the need to prioritise scarce resources. At some stage in the future the matter could be reviewed, but the committee felt that the government's actions in this regard were reasonable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the Oakey agreement, there was obviously consultation with the local councils. But, again, I think not enough has been done in dealing with some of the day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day arrangements associated with housing this significant group of Singaporeans who will be living in Australia on a rotational basis&mdash;coming to and fro and staying here for a short period. Issues such as health seem to have been addressed and schooling in a general sense. But there will be no contribution by the Singaporeans towards the cost of education of their children in Australia and I think that is an issue that should be addressed in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, the arrival of these large numbers of people will add to the infrastructure needs, particularly of the Jondaryan Shire Council and Toowoomba City. There have never been any significant infrastructure contributions by the Australian defence forces in acknowledgment of the presence of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2772"> Oakey base. Whilst the Oakey community warmly appreciates having the base in their community, it does place a cost burden on the ratepayers. Other industries that become established in a community are expected to make infrastructure contributions. I think the Commonwealth should regard itself as having an obligation in that regard. For instance, Jondaryan shire is apparently no longer going to be able to have a power station constructed in significant parts of the shire because of the risk that the flight paths associated with the Oakey base could be affected by power station stacks.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a potential loss of industry and I think that the Jondaryan shire is entitled to expect some degree of compensation for that loss.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nonetheless, the community at large is obviously welcoming the arrival of the Singaporeans. I think this agreement is an example of excellent cooperation between us and one of our fellow Commonwealth members and can greatly improve relations between our countries. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs I present the following paper, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Constitutional change</EMPHASIS> , subtitled, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Select sources on constitutional change in Australia 1901&hyphen;1997</EMPHASIS> .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In recent times there has been an increased interest in constitutional matters, particularly with the approach of the people's convention which is scheduled to be held later this year.  As we approach the centenary of Federation, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> each month and year represent a centennial anniversary of one or other significant constitutional landmarks in our history. At present, it is just 100 years since the inaugural meeting of the 1897&hyphen;98 Australasian Federal Convention. The object of that convention was to draft the constitution bill to be put to the people at a referendum and then to be presented to the British Parliament for passage as imperial legislation. The Adelaide session of the Australasian Federal Convention met from 22 March to 23 April in 1897. The convention later met in Sydney and in Melbourne. The people's convention to be held this year will be the first large scale popular convention since the 1896 Bathurst People's Federal Convention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the centenaries of these events serve to heighten our sense of history and our pride in the achievements of the past 100 years, we should not imagine that the constitution itself has been left in peace for the duration. From the time the Commonwealth parliament first met the machinery provisions relating to the establishment of the federation were already outdated. Much work has gone into analysing and reconsidering the work of the founding fathers. The committee believes that this work is relevant to preparations for further constitutional review. Accordingly, it has compiled a collection of these sources on constitutional change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This document originated as a private committee document. We sought to undertake an inquiry on a constitutional matter, but at the same time wanted to avoid duplicating the work of others. Accordingly, we analysed over 300 recommendations made by the major reviews of the constitution over the past 40 years. In particular, we analysed the recommendations of the 1959 report of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Constitutional Review which met in various capital cities, the reports of the Australian Constitutional Convention which met in various capital cities between 1973 and 1985, and the report of the Constitutional Commission which met between 1985 and 1988.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In order to make sense of the large number of recommendations, we inserted them into the constitution itself, thereby creating an 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2773"> annotated constitution, with reference to each of these major reviews. The committee then concluded that the resulting document would be of some value to others with an interest in the Australian constitution. The decision was taken to publish the document and to add value to it by including a history of referenda conducted over the life of the federation. Referenda are a practical result of recommendations for constitutional reform. Forty&hyphen;two separate proposals have been put to the people on 18 occasions since 1901. Only eight of the 42 proposals have received sufficient support to satisfy the requirements of section 128 of the constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that part 2, therefore, of this document, which summarises the arguments and outcomes relevant to each referendum since 1901, is one of the most comprehensive collections of information on the history of referenda in Australia. The document was then further enhanced by adding a bibliography on constitutional change. For this we are indebted to the Parliamentary Library staff who played a major part in compiling it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee hopes that this collection of sources will be useful to the public in general and to students of constitutional law and political science in secondary schools and universities in particular. It should also be of interest to those who wish to contribute to the 1997 people's convention and to those who want to follow the proceedings of that convention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to thank the members of the committee for their support for this project, particularly the father of the House, the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), whose idea it was to add to the original document and to put it into the public arena. The committee's thanks also go to members of the secretariat, particularly to the secretary, Judy Middlebrook, and to Claressa Surtees, Natalie James, Kathryn Cole and Laura Gillies. I commend this document to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As deputy chair of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, I am pleased to be able to support the  remarks of the member for Menzies (Mr 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Andrews). This document, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Select sources on Constitutional change in Australia 1901&mdash;1997</EMPHASIS> , sounds a bit dry, but it is not. For anyone interested in constitutional history or interested in changing our constitution, it is a very valuable work and will certainly repay reading.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is in three parts. The first is the annotated constitution, which includes an excellent detailed history of the consideration of constitutional change by official bodies. For example, in the preamble the constitution says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:&hyphen;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The 1988 Constitutional Commission recommended that the enacting clause be repealed because it could give the reader the impression that Australia is still subject to the will of the legislature of the United Kingdom. The report has further references for people who are interested in further pursuing issues like that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, it has a history of referendums. I particularly want to commend this part of the document to the Queensland Premier, Rob Borbidge, who is threatening to replace Senator Mal Colston, if he were to resign, with an Independent. Premier Borbidge needs to read the history of referendums and, in particular, note the new section 15, which was inserted into the constitution on 21 May 1977 and which, in fact, was passed by over 73 per cent of the electorate who voted for that proposition concerning changes to Senate casual vacancies. That particular provision states that where a senator resigns:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . at the time he was so chosen, he was publicly recognised by a particular political party as being an endorsed candidate of that party and publicly represented himself to be such a candidate, a person&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">has to be a member of that party. So in endorsing the yes case, those 73&hyphen;odd per cent of the electorate said `It is the fundamental right of voters that the Senate should reflect the wishes of the electorate.' This section was inserted precisely to prevent skulduggery of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2774"> the kind engaged in by Premier Borbidge's predecessor, Sir Joh Bjelke&hyphen;Petersen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I experienced a certain amount of nostalgia reading this because one of the provisions relates to the referendum to outlaw the Communist Party. Some 20 years ago at Melbourne University, I did my honours thesis on this referendum. It was in excess of 10,000 words. Most readers will find that the 1&half; pages in this document will suffice, rather than needing to read the whole of the 10,000 words.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third part of the document is a first&hyphen;class bibliography setting out the many places where a student or anyone interested in the constitution can derive further information. This document will be most useful in debate concerning constitutional change, which is gathering momentum as we near the end of the century and celebrate the centenary of Federation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, the opposition regards the issue of Australia obtaining its own head of state and becoming a republic as the most pressing issue, but there are, of course, others. We believe that there ought to be a vote&mdash;not a referendum which would actually generate a republic itself, but a vote of the Australian people to tell both the government and the opposition the direction in which they want our energies directed so far as the constitution is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like the chair of the committee, I would also wish to thank the staff&mdash;Judy Middlebrook, Claressa Surtees, Natalie James, Kathryn Cole and Laura Gillies&mdash;for their work. Also, I acknowledge that it was the suggestion of the member for New England (Mr Sinclair) which played an important role in having this valuable document published.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am indebted to the honourable member for Cook (Mr Mutch) for allowing me a little of his time. I really want to say three things. The first is to say thanks to those who mentioned my contribution in initiating this annotated constitution and, secondly, to say to Judy Middlebrook, Claressa Surtees and the committee congratulations yet again on an excellent report. Thirdly, I think it is terribly important, as we move into the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> constitutional convention, that there is an opportunity for people to know where we are up to in constitutional change. Being the only continuing member of the parliament who has actually sat at each of the modern conventions from 1973 to 1985, I believe there is a great deal of confusion about where we are in constitutional change.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This volume helps to elucidate where we are, where we have been and what recommendations are made. While it will mean that there can be now more lucid debate, it shows that that final question&mdash;the drafting of a bill for a referendum which needs to be considered and passed by this parliament&mdash;is something that cannot be taken lightly. While one goes through the whole process of constitutional reform, it needs to be recognised that reform itself is only possible after a bill for a referendum has been passed, and that debate is often more substantial, and the questions that the parliament and the government need to pursue in order to introduce that bill are often more substantial, than perhaps many realise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not easy in our system to intrude on the ordinary electoral processes in order to achieve what demonstrably, from this volume, are a number of quite significantly agreed positions in terms of constitutional change. I believe this volume will help to expose many of those areas where change is desirable and, hopefully, to elucidate generally a better understanding of the Australian constitution than many have had to date.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, I am pleased to speak to the tabling of this publication entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Constitutional Change&mdash;Select sources on Constitutional change in Australia 1901&mdash;1997</EMPHASIS> . This book is a gem. It brings together in a timely way essential information on the history of official attempts at constitutional change since the inauguration of our Commonwealth. These attempts have been mostly unsuccessful. Despite four wide&hyphen;ranging official reviews of the constitution by four different methods&mdash;royal commission, joint committee, convention and commission&mdash;producing hundreds of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2775"> recommendations, very few have been acted upon and ultimately, out of 42 proposals put to referendum on 18 occasions since 1901, only eight have satisfied section 128 of the constitution and passed at referendum.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On this basis, a statistician might rate the official attempts a failure and one might give long odds on our proposed people's convention achieving what many would call reform. I would like to say two things about that. The first is that our constitution has proved to be durable. It has endured stubbornly many concerted attempts at change. Some may see this intractability as mulish behaviour by the Australian people who respond negatively to the entreaties of politicians and respond negatively to the proposed assumption of more power by the central government. Those critics should bear in mind that the carrot is a more effective tool than the stick and that mules kick those who attempt to push them too far.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the advent of a new millennium, which quite auspiciously links our federal centenary with the dawning of a new century, gives us literally a once in 100 years opportunity to focus on the document upon which our federation rests and gives us the opportunity, if it is needed, to breath new life and vigour into our constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the committee secretariat for this publication. It came out of background work undertaken by the secretariat. Claressa Surtees is to be specially commended and Natalie James singled out for her work on the referenda section. I believe it was the idea of the honourable member for Lilley (Mrs Elizabeth Grace) to annotate the constitution and the encouragement of the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) that led to publication. I commend this book to students of our constitution and, indeed, to all Australians.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The legislation in this package of superannuation bills seeks to apply a surcharge to those whose income is in excess of $70,000, phased in at one per cent for every $1,000 earned above $70,000 up to a maximum 15 per cent for those earning $85,000 or more. I am advised that the procedure for collection of the surcharge requires it to be collected by the super fund managers. They will be required to do this by first notifying the Australian Taxation Office of the details of contributions they have received from their fund members by the end of October each year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ATO will then collate this information against each taxpayer's statement of taxable income to determine how much each taxpayer owes. This is notified to the super fund manager, who debits that amount from the taxpayer's superannuation account. From 1998, a provisional surcharge will be paid in advance of 50 per cent of the amount of surcharge paid by the same taxpayer in the previous financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Institute of Chartered Accountants, the fund operators, the states, the businesses, the investment and economics media and the fund members all oppose it. Almost everyone who is affected by the surcharge opposes it for a variety of reasons&mdash;some well argued and presented, others less so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Who is not opposed to it? Clearly, it is the Australian Taxation Office and the coalition's policy makers. I cannot think of anyone else. There are even many members of the coalition who I now know oppose this measure but, unfortunately, not many of them are willing to state this publicly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would, however, like to commend one of my former colleagues in the Liberal Party, the member for Stirling (Mr Eoin Cameron), for the leadership he has shown on this matter. He has stated publicly that he is against this legislation because the surcharge sent the wrong message to people trying to save for retirement. He also thinks that the surcharge is a tax, regardless of how you dress it up, and that the very people it is supposed to tax are opting out in their droves.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2777">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Stirling is developing a record for standing up for his constituents on matters of principle, and I am sure they will recognise his courage even in the face of some intimidation by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and reward him for it. They will know that they are getting the type of issue based representation from the member for Stirling that normally only Independent members can provide for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Institute of Chartered Accountants has made a series of complaints about how the superannuation surcharge will work and the principle behind it. The ICA believes that the surcharge will not collect the $450 million in revenue projected in the last 1996 budget. It claims that administrative complexities related to collecting the surcharge are enormous. Government has agreed by default in stating that the super funds will be better able to shoulder the compliance burden than small business employers. This may be in consolation for the unwanted added compliance burden placed on small business earlier with the implementation of the government's family tax initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even though the government has said that small business will be free of compliance burden, this view is not shared by all. Mr Mark Paterson, Chief Executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, has been reported as saying that `they have come up with a highly complex structure that won't avoid cost burdens and responsibilities on small business'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ICA has made an estimate that a cost of $30 million will be attracted just to communicate with the 15.7 million fund members. A further cost estimated at $100 million annually will be required to maintain the surcharge. With the national disillusionment with lack of reform to the small business environment, it is no wonder that the government has maintained that this burden will be borne by the funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The actual end financial cost, however, will be borne by the contributors to super funds. You do not have to be an accountant to recognise that this will mean that the administrative cost for the surcharge will be borne by all members of funds and by employers who 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> pay contributions on behalf of their staff. By imposing a levy, surcharge or tax in this way, the government will be reducing the capital available for investment and be directly responsible for a fund member's lower return on their investment or on their contributions. To compound that effect, government then will increase the administrative costs to the fund operator which must be borne by the fund's only source of income&mdash;it will be taken from investors' expected dividends.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Employers may get hit twice. Many of them are in superannuation funds themselves and suffer simply because they are a fund member who has worked hard, performed to his or her potential and earned over $70,000 per annum. But there is also the superannuation employer contribution that they pay on behalf of their workers, some of whom may also fall into the target area for income. These staff members have probably negotiated wage and salary packages based on current and projected values that will now be devalued from one to 15 per cent. Eventually, employers will have to make up that gap.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A loss of superannuation investment of one to 15 per cent in today's values may seem reasonable, but consider the potential capital return of that money when taken at a reasonable market rate of, say, 10, 15, 20 years or more. I believe that this will be a significant attack on people who have actually shown themselves to be traditional coalition supporters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will claim no doubt that this surcharge is an impost forced on it by Labor's financial mismanagement. This will not wash in this case, as people know there are other better alternatives. They will consider this a disincentive to investment in superannuation and, yes, they are going to have to move money to other forms of investment. But I do not think they will forgive the coalition government for this measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ICA points out that taxpayers who do not fall into the target income bracket will be asked to bear the government cost, which is estimated to be millions of dollars, to administer the new regime. Staff will have to be employed or redeployed, and organisations and procedures will have to be developed and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2778"> implemented to monitor and maintain collection of the surcharge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another effect the ICA has identified the surcharge will have on small business is that it will act in a detrimental fashion. The owners of a small company might struggle with costs and operations until they reach profitability and then find, as they put money away for retirement, they are stuck with this surcharge with no account for previous losses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is equally so for primary producers and women who have incomes that are not cyclic or stable. They generally have a shorter period of high income which may pay off for years of hard work, but then they will be hard hit by a reduction in their expected superannuation benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People who take redundancies and lump sum superannuation will also be targeted in the year they take payouts. Many are likely to be slugged the full 15 per cent on rollovers and the like that should more properly have been used to make them independent of government benefits in their retirement. Again, I believe this is highly counterproductive in terms of our national investment psyche.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Institute of Chartered Accountants believes that government has underestimated the number of people to be affected. It claims it is not 355,000 superannuation fund members but up to 700,000. This is obviously a substantial variation and, if true, would represent a significant number of the most financially successful and probably productive people in the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In reality, though, whether these figures are accurate or not, may be irrelevant in terms of the damage done to the psyche of investors in Australia. Even if the number of people in Australia earning more than $70,000 annually is less than 355,000, there are many people who aspire to, or intend to, earn that level of income during their working life. They will be making the decisions which determine their investments for their retirement well before that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This surcharge will be seen as an attack on the investments of a small and responsible group of people because they have had the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sense to plan for their financial future. For them, the surcharge is a positive disincentive and is bad fiscal policy and bad politics generally. If the government is seeking to justify an attack on the potential livelihood of a group as reasonable as this because they are a small group, then it is an immoral decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Investment for the future is usually a long&hyphen;term proposition. If people expect they can attract a significant tax liability on their investment part way through their working life, they will seek alternatives. This will mean a general reduction in superannuation investment and a resultant loss of money in infrastructure and other typical forms of fund investment to other types of financial speculation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What will be the effect on our economy? I think there is a more serious underlying problem that we are tinkering at the fringes of our taxation system while mouthing an intention to reform it. How much more difficult to achieve substantial reform will this tinkering make it? Government must come up with an integrated approach to taxation, the economy and our national savings and stop messing around with people's lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having communicated its views to government, there has been an astounding silence in reply. Interestingly, the Institute of Chartered Accountants' members are trusted to advise the investing public and run the financial interests of most small, medium and even large businesses in Australia, but when they seek to advise government of what may be a flawed financial approach they are dismissed as partisan philistines.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Let me read a letter I received recently from a constituent. It illustrates the effects that changes to superannuation, which are typified by today's debate, have on the community attitude to saving. This letter is typical of hundreds and thousands of opinions that are being expressed across the country, as I am sure many coalition backbenchers will testify. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Mr Filing,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recent reports, both from newspapers and television, regarding changes proposed by the Government to legislation regarding superannuation is of great concern to my wife and to me. The report that superannuation pay outs will not be available until individuals reach 60 years of age and that lump sum payments will not be available is of particular concern.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My wife and I are both members of the State Government Employees Superannuation Fund. I have been teaching for thirty years now and my wife for 25 years and we have faithfully paid into our superannuation fund believing we would have the option of retiring at 55.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over the years, we have planned our investment strategies and modified our lifestyle so that we could retire somewhere between 55 to 57 and enjoy our remaining years. It came as a very rude shock to read that the Government is now considering denying us the option.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our superannuation payments will not make us rich, however wisely invested they should allow us to live comfortably with no need to call on the Government for any form of support in our retirement years. My wife and I have both worked diligently and saved hard to allow us to take advantage of retirement near the age of 55. To be told that our plans for retirement could be put on hold for almost 5 years filled us with dismay.</PARA>

The AMP Society published an interesting article in its November 1996 issue of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Super Trends</EMPHASIS>  magazine, which examined the issues of national and household savings. It noted:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a deterioration in public savings since the mid 1970s has been a major contributor to Australia's national savings deterioration, the problem looks primarily to be due to low private savings . . .

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This package of bills will directly contribute to lower national savings, which is directly related to our high national debt. The AMP article also identified that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there are essentially three main motivations for individuals to save: to fund retirement; to fund major items of expenditure (for instance, a home deposit, car, future education expenses, travel); and, to build up wealth as a precaution against events such as future loss of income/unemployment or health costs.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Of the several factors driving household savings, three of the key drivers were the real 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2780"> after&hyphen;tax return to savings; expectation about government provision of social security, health care, et cetera; and community attitudes to saving.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most important point about real after&hyphen;tax return to savings made here is that the Australian taxation system is significantly distorting the pattern of post&hyphen;tax returns being faced by investors for different assets. Without a simplified and reformed taxation system all forms of investment, and particularly superannuation, will become so complicated that, as intimated by Rob Sitch in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS>, it will become the exclusive domain of members of Mensa.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly&mdash;the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tax Pack</EMPHASIS> , which has now swollen to almost <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">War and Peace</EMPHASIS>  proportions. I read a report of statements by a leading Australian actuary in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>  recently which called the plan for the surcharge `ill conceived and inequitable'. Mr Lockery indicated that there needed to be an adequate tax concession to encourage people to accept the disadvantage of saving through superannuation. This legislation would reduce the tax concession for surcharge affected contributions to seven per cent. This was not enough to encourage people to save, given that super savings were locked away&mdash;perhaps for 35 to 40 years&mdash;could not be borrowed against and were now subject to a substantial perceived legislative risk. People were concerned that the government could change the rules, such as to compel benefits to be taken as a pension, and that people could not exit the super system to avoid adverse changes. You are damned if you do and you are damned if you don't. You are between a rock and a hard place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let's look at expectation about government provision of social security, health care, et cetera. In the post&hyphen;World War II period there has been a steady increase in government provision for such things as retirement, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> unemployment benefits, education and medical care, not just for low income groups but also for middle&hyphen;income families. The community has also become aware of the enormous costs facing government in regard to care for an ageing population, which will absorb more and more of our resources. Given that the volume of funds for this purpose is likely to remain limited, many people have seen that, in order to be relatively comfortable in retirement, they will have to provide some form of nest egg for the future. This has seen a steady and responsible move by large numbers of people into investments like superannuation which, until now, have been actively supported by government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Community attitudes to saving: I think I have made it particularly clear that this is the area which has been most severely and detrimentally affected by this surcharge legislation. I do not think I need to elaborate other than to say that the loss of public support for superannuation savings alone will have a deleterious effect on the existing financial structures in our economy in which many Australians have invested for their future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At this stage I must reiterate some of my comments from the retirement savings accounts debate as I fear that in this legislation package the government is going to reinforce some of the errors in judgment that I believe it made there. There can be no doubt that there is a real need in Australia to improve savings and that our national economic wellbeing is directly linked to savings. It has been a longstanding policy from both sides of politics that we need to convince people that money should be invested in super funds. The proportion of their income has often been the area where the divergence of opinion has occurred. In this case we are going to place a tax or surcharge on the money that they have available and proportionately reduce their expected return.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Equally, however, it must be accepted that there is a finite money supply for application to public savings. The question is: how much of it can be or should be invested in superannuation? I would be interested to find what the government's research shows concerning this. What will be the effects on the national 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2781"> economy if the government can achieve a significant relocation of investment from, say, stock market or commercial real estate into banks through superannuation accounts?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation is going to move more than 15 per cent of the superannuation capital available for private investment out of that function and into government debt reduction. What is the government's evaluation of the effect of this? It is an active government policy, supported by statements by the Treasurer, that the single most important thing that this government has been doing for average workers, taxpayers and, therefore, superannuation contributors is to create an environment where mortgage interest rates are low, thereby giving people more disposable income. This surcharge will mean that they will have to invest significantly more of this disposable income to get the same return. This does not create an environment for government to convince people that part of this increased disposable income should be invested in superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I regard this bill as a bad piece of legislation based on a flawed concept. I would like to see it defeated in this place, with as many coalition members as are able to draw on the example of the member for Stirling joining in to vote it down. The government and its policy makers have been presented with a range of alternatives from a variety of sources, largely from the stakeholders in this issue&mdash;those most closely affected. They have included alternatives which do not stifle investment or act as a disincentive to people in the community to strive to do well. Unfortunately, we have seen an intransigent inability to meet these demands. What I would like to see is a more clearly integrated approach by the government to the whole question of superannuation and its place in public savings, taxation and the national economy. I do not believe that such a strategy has been well enough demonstrated as yet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we in this country need is a complete package of tax reform to provide an integrated framework that takes into account all forms of investment and revenue generation and that is easily understood and managed by those it serves. It should precede this bill package. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Until we have such an approach, government will continue to be tinkering at the margin with, I believe, an inadequate understanding of or proper concern for the consequences. As a consequence, I will be voting against this bill and will be calling for a division at the proper time.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The position of the opposition on the government's new superannuation tax legislation, now before the House, has already been outlined by the shadow Treasurer, the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans). We do not oppose the principles behind this legislation. However, we do have grave reservations about the way the government intends to implement its legislation and collect the new tax. Our greatest condemnation is reserved for the Treasurer, the member for Higgins (Mr Costello), who continues to arrogantly deceive the Australian people by attempting to portray this new tax as a surcharge. The Treasurer has made a bit of a habit of deceiving the Australian people since his first budget, but he cannot really keep that arrogant smirk off his face when he tells the Australian people that his new superannuation tax is really just an ordinary old surcharge.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As late as 12 March on Radio National, as the shadow Treasurer pointed out in his speech to this House, the Treasurer was referring to this additional impost as a tax, yet in presenting this legislation to this House the government continues with the fiction that its new measure constitutes a surcharge. But none of us ought to forget that the architect of this new tax is none other than the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), the man who lives in the land of broken electoral promises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said in my initial remarks, the opposition does not intend to oppose this legislation. However, we would like a couple of small concessions from the Prime Minister. We would like him to come into this House and concede to the Australian people two simple things: yes, this is a new tax, it is not a surcharge; and, yes, this does constitute another broken promise of this embattled government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This particular broken promise is but the latest in a lexicon of broken promises from 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2782"> this deceitful and, as I have said, embattled government. The Prime Minister's broken promises are rapidly acquiring legendary status in Australia's political history. If you go into regional Australia, there is a deep sense of betrayal at the first Howard budget. If you go and talk to small business, no matter how much the Prime Minister wants to put a gloss on the coin, the tills just are not rattling. It is a story of electoral betrayal in that sector of the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as working parents are concerned, they have been betrayed by the industrial relations legislation and by the child&hyphen;care provisions of the previous budget. As far as the aged constituency of this country are concerned&mdash;and they are particularly relevant to the debate we are having in this House tonight on superannuation&mdash;the introduction of the nursing home fee has been a cynical betrayal by the Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So when it comes to superannuation and the Howard government's new superannuation tax let no contributor to a superannuation fund be under any illusion that this constitutes anything more than just another broken promise by this Prime Minister. I reiterate the fact that as an opposition we do not contest any objective the government might have in promoting greater equity in the superannuation area, but the simple fact is this: this legislation violates even the most fundamental principles that should underpin the introduction of any new taxation measure in the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These fundamental principles are very easy even for a failed past Liberal Treasurer to understand. The first is that any tax that is introduced should be equitable, and clearly this new superannuation tax is not. The second is that any new taxation measure ought not be complex. This legislation clearly is very complex. The third is that any new taxation measure should be easy to collect. This tax certainly is not. And any new taxation measure that is proposed by any government ought to have reasonable costs of collection. We now know from industry sources that the cost of collecting this new superannuation tax will be quite exorbitant.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On every test that you might apply to this new tax, this measure of the Howard government fails miserably. That is why the opposition is proposing a series of amendments as this legislation moves through this chamber. Let me deal separately with each of the criteria I have just enunciated so that this House and the Australian people can get a better appreciation of just how flawed this new superannuation tax legislation really is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I stated earlier, this legislation fails the test of equity. It seeks to increase the superannuation contributions of high income earners, starting at $70,000 and phasing up to $85,000 and beyond. However, there is legal advice to suggest that the application of this tax to High Court judges, for example, might be unconstitutional because it reduces their income during their tenure in the High Court. In addition, the legislation is likely to be challenged by many high income state public servants across the nation, again on constitutional grounds relating to the Commonwealth's taxing of state property.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Moving out of the public sector to the private sector, there is the very real danger that the response of high income earners will be to structure their salary arrangements to reduce the impact of the Howard government's new superannuation tax. Such high income earners may be encouraged to opt for non&hyphen;cash remuneration such as cars and school fees or they may well split their income through trusts or, indeed, invest more in negatively geared assets. So in both the public and the private sectors many high income earners may for legal and other reasons avoid paying this new superannuation tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the equity impact is not only when you look at high income earners in this country. The most insidious effects on low and middle income earners will be if they do not provide their tax file numbers to superannuation funds. As the member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) so eloquently pointed out in his speech to the House, if only 10 per cent of superannuation contributors failed to put in their tax file numbers to their superannuation funds, then over three&hyphen;quarters of a million people will be penalised by this measure. The 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2783"> equity implications of this for low income earners who are caught in this new superannuation tax net are substantial.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to failing the basic test of equity, the legislation fails the administrative efficiency test as well. This aspect was most eloquently explained by the shadow Treasurer in his contribution to this debate in this House. If the government were to come clean with the Australian people and call it what it is, a new tax, then there would be four simple steps to calculate the liability of the taxpayer. But, by denying the reality and calling it a surcharge and structuring a collection mechanism around its own deceit, it will take eight discrete steps to implement this new tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cost of this unnecessary and complex collection procedure will have to be borne by the super fund and the ordinary superannuation contributor. Just to communicate with their 15.7 million contributors, the super funds will have to spend in the region of $30 million. Some industry analysts have put this cost at up to $100 million per year. So not only is the legislation complex and administratively inefficient but it is costly as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The effect on small business is going to be substantial as well. This is a government that has come into this House today and browbeaten us all about how they are the government for small business. When they are put to the simple acid test in a piece of legislation such as this, they increase the paper burden and the red tape on small business enormously. My advice to small business across this nation is simply this: do not look to what the government says they are going to do; look to what they actually do in their legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me quote from a letter from LBW Chartered Accountants in my electorate which had this to say about the impact of this legislation on small business:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Small business will be badly affected. For years, small business people take big risks struggling to make reasonable incomes. When they do, those incomes are often limited to only a five to ten year period. For the few years they can contribute to superannuation in a meaningful way they will be penalised by high taxes on that saving.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The conclusion of one of the firms that deals with small business in my electorate is that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> small business will be badly affected by this new tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous speaker in this debate, the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing), eloquently stated the impact this particular legislation will have on the national savings effort. The Treasurer has already conceded that the revenue shortfall in 1997-98 will be $46 million less than the budgeted outcome in the first budget delivered by this government. Even more disturbing are reports by the Institute of Chartered Accountants that 60 per cent of the clients of chartered accountants are currently being advised to restructure their retirement arrangements in the face of this new Liberal tax. This is likely to exacerbate the revenue shortfall that the Treasurer has already conceded in this debate thus far.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I have referred here to the direct impact on the budget outcome in future years, when one contemplates the long-term effect on the national savings effort the impact is even more severe, but it is much more difficult to quantify. The simple fact is that high income earners will change their retirement income strategy in response to the tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This along with other measures announced in the first Howard budget will certainly dilute the national savings pool. It will deliver a severe blow to the confidence of ordinary taxpayers in the superannuation arrangements that are currently in force in this country. The administrative complexity and the cost of this proposal will even further still dilute the confidence of the community in superannuation as a savings and retirement incomes vehicle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In government, the Labor Party sought to expand the range of income security measures to provide older Australians with a better standard of living in their retirement. One of the great achievements of Labor in power for 13 years was the way in which more working Australians gained access to the benefits of superannuation. Under previous Liberal governments, superannuation was merely a tax perk for the rich and for well-off workers. Ordinary working Australians were not able to access this sort of retirement income program that would deliver them a better 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2784"> income and standard of living in their retirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That all changed under Labor in power. Labor literally transformed the role of superannuation in Australia, making it a central pillar in the retirement incomes policy framework of the nation. The statistics on employees accessing superannuation really speak for themselves. In 1983, only 40 per cent of employees had access to superannuation. By 1995, nearly 90 per cent had super coverage. But these overall statistics mask an even greater achievement as far as the women of Australia are concerned. In 1983, only 24 per cent of women had superannuation coverage. In 1993, that figure had increased to some 85 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We hear a lot from the present coalition government about the record of the previous Labor government. The previous Labor government had one thing that this present tory government clearly does not possess: an understanding of the challenges facing Australia beyond the year 2000, a vision of what Australia might be 10 to 15 years out and the political will to initiate the sorts of changes that preserve the essential social fabric of the nation as well as progressing it in an economic sense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We understood quite clearly in government that superannuation held the key to securing better retirement incomes for working Australians. We also understood its role in boosting the national savings effort, reducing our overseas debt and dependence on foreign borrowings and securing a domestic source of investment in our own future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As at March 1996, when Labor left power, those superannuation funds assets stood at $243 billion and are projected to exceed $600 billion by the year 2005. The centrepiece of Labor's last budget in power was a series of initiatives in the superannuation area designed to dramatically boost national savings. That budget did two things. It provided for the phased introduction through industrial awards and agreements of an employee contribution to superannuation by the year 2000. It also provided payments of the second round of One Nation cuts directly into super accounts, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> matching the three per cent contribution of employees and the self-employed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The goal of this policy was to have employees direct some 15 per cent of their earnings to superannuation by the year 2000 to the benefit of this nation. In practical terms, it meant an increase in national savings by two per cent of GDP by the year 2000 and by up to four per cent by the year 2020.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The very simple reality of Australia's ageing population and its national debt dictated a dramatic and visionary response from the national government. That is why I am absolutely amazed and disappointed at the lack of vision being displayed by this government in this area in the weakening of the national savings effort. They have provided the opportunity for workers to opt out of super, and they will put that burden on the public purse in future. Through the ambit of this legislation before the House, there is a direct incentive now for high income earners to restructure their affairs and opt out of superannuation as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about the $4.5 billion of One Nation tax cuts? This arrogant Treasurer has once again ratted on a promise to the Australian people. Let us call it for what it is. It is a ratting on a promise that he and his Prime Minister made to the Australian people before the election. That promise was made in the context that the then opposition clearly understood that, if there was a budget deficit, they would hold fast to the promises they had made. I say this to the Treasurer: you can easily rat on a promise that you made to the Australian people in 1996 in the face of a $9 billion to $10 billion budget deficit, but Labor never ratted on the commitments it made to the Australian people in the face of a current dollar $25 billion deficit that was left to it by John Howard when he was Treasurer of this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a severely flawed piece of legislation. It fails the administrative efficiency test. It is very costly to implement and, at the end of the day, it is a most inequitable measure. That is why the opposition is proposing a series of amendments to the legislation before this House. We simply say to the government: this is your measure now; you are now gov 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2785"> erning this country. You have put this legislation before the Australian people&mdash;this flawed, inequitable new super tax. At the end of the day, if we fail in the attempts to amend it, as oppositions should, and if we fail to convince you that you ought to amend this legislation in the interests of the superannuation community and in the interests of working Australians, then it will be on your head. You will have to wear the political consequences of one of the most stupid pieces of legislation to come before this House in this session.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is an extraordinary situation when a government presented with the hard way or the easy way of achieving an end chooses what is not only the hard way but also&mdash;if the view of senior constitutional lawyer Dennis Rose is correct&mdash;the impossible way of achieving its end. Why is it that this government is committed to an outcome and a process that overlooks what would have been a simple method of achieving an impost of the kind that it wishes to make on high income earners to increase their tax liability?  It is because they do not want to be fingered with the words `a broken promise'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They do not want to be fingered with a broken promise, but they are quite happy to break the promise nonetheless. They are quite happy to implement through weasel words an outcome which effectively increases the tax liability on every person in the higher income bands in a way which is totally inconsistent with their pre-election commitments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As an equity measure, the Labor Party says, a higher impost on those particular taxpayers is not, in principle, to be objected to, but we do object to being taken, and to the community being taken, as fools. We want it to be plainly understood that what is being done is a complex and administratively stupid way of achieving that which would be administratively simple if it was struck as a tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is highly probable that whatever outcome emerges from this parliament will be held to be unconstitutional if it passes in the form the government proposes. That is the outcome of senior constitutional advice by Dennis Rose, whom I, as Attorney-General for a short 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> period and Minister for Justice, had the pleasure of working closely with. I would have thought that those who know Dennis would take the view that an opinion expressed with the confidence that he has expressed it is unlikely to be little regarded by the High Court of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nonetheless, this government is prepared to put forward legislation knowing that it is potentially flawed in that way and knowing that it has strong objections to overcome in terms of the cost of the implementation and the fact that the friction caused by the red tape and administration will be expensive to the funds. What does that mean? Funds are not profit making institutions in the main; they are holding in trust moneys on behalf of contributors. So it means that the ultimate payouts of people putting into superannuation are reduced&mdash;all this so that the government avoids having to face the obvious truth, that it is imposing a significant new tax, a tax which the opposition in principle is prepared to support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is important, however, to realise that all this has to be seen in a larger context. We are in danger of becoming obsessed with the detail of this legislation, appalling though it be, to the detriment of seeing the wider scheme. The wider scheme is that, over a very long period, the Australian people have been party to a series of agreements with their government which have seen increasing funding of national superannuation. Over a series of elections, the community has agreed with government that there would be a national commitment towards building a retirement policy framework which would be able to be sustained throughout the period when our population will be ageing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not an insubstantial issue. One of the things we are able to do in opposition is to be a little reflective. In the first year of our period in opposition, my particular shadow responsibilities have been changed to include overall interest in the area of population policy issues. So the title I now hold is shadow minister for population issues, as well as shadow minister for immigration and assistant to the Leader of the Opposition on multicultural affairs.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2786">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the significance of population in this debate? The significance is this: for the foreseeable future, Australia will continue to have&mdash;as it presently has&mdash;a demographic profile which means that we are not producing a replacement level for the future. The short&hyphen;term effects do not mean that population declines&mdash;for the next 30 or 40 years, until the present phalanx of women of child&hyphen;bearing age passes through that group, Australia's population will continue to increase. The actual population outcomes will depend&mdash;in part&mdash;on minor variations in birth rates but also on decisions to be made by this and future governments about immigration levels. Whatever those decisions are, there is no doubt that we will be a significantly more aged population by the time we reach the year 2030 and, absent a significant increase through immigration at that time, our population will be not only aged but aged and declining. So we face the prospect of a narrower base of taxpayers meeting the forward costs of health and aged care into the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that framework, it was very important that we develop a national system of savings which would in part militate against the cost to public revenues of ageing. There is no doubt that this issue should be squarely on the public policy agenda across the board. It was drawn attention to. The government has no excuse for not knowing of its significance. The Commission of Audit reported on this matter in very alarming terms&mdash;too alarming, I think. Some of its projections in terms of the costs it anticipated as the population aged&mdash;particularly in the health care sector&mdash;go beyond the expectations of what is a rational and prudent set of numbers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nonetheless, it is correct to identify this as an issue which requires significant and prolonged policy attention. Other governments are starting to address the issue too. The British people are now going to an election, and one of the issues in contest is Prime Minister John Major's proposal to privatise the pension&mdash;to require all British workers to make a personal contribution to long&hyphen;term arrangements towards their retirement. In Labor's approach there is no suggestion of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> privatising pensions. It was designed to make sure the retirement income of those who went through the work force would be greater than it otherwise would have been if all that was available to them was a pension benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Building such a system means that there will be less strain on public revenues, and it increases national savings. You have a significant pool of investment funds available&mdash;through the accumulated retirement savings of Australians, held in managed funds&mdash;for infrastructure investment and other investment in Australia. Now we discover two things are happening. Firstly, about 60 per cent of those in a position to provide for themselves in superannuation type schemes are being advised not to do so by accountants and actuaries, who&mdash;because of the kind of measures that this new government is bringing into place&mdash;are saying to them, `There are better ways to provide for your future than through the superannuation scheme.' That means that the superannuation investment structures are&mdash;for the first time&mdash;going to be significantly less beneficial to Australia in terms of the savings they contribute than they would otherwise have been. It also knocks on the head some of the revenue projections that this government has made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, this government is backing off the promise to pay the $4.5 billion of contributions the government pledged itself to&mdash;under the provisions the Keating government had first anticipated&mdash;to match additional contributions from the workers. During the election campaign the shadow Treasurer committed the coalition to that. What this means is that, instead of there being a structure in place that will continue to expand the growth in superannuation and make greater public and private provision for people's retirements through superannuation, we are knocking a national strategic vehicle to address long&hyphen;term savings on the head and not providing an appropriate vehicle for addressing the structural ageing that our society faces&mdash;and we are doing so for short&hyphen;term narrow political gain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not very good policy making; it is very ugly policy making. When they confront this legislation, members of this House&mdash;and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2787"> the Senate&mdash;ought to reflect very carefully before they allow it through in the form that is proposed. There is nothing wrong with a government genuinely putting forward an additional impost to increase taxation of high income earners in the superannuation system. Of course, if the impost is too high, it will kill the golden goose. But, assuming that the level at which it is set is one which will still give some advantage to people investing in superannuation, we do not object to that kind of approach. But we do say that it is terribly silly for a government to go through enormously complicated processes which will catch up unintended victims&mdash;all those people who do not provide tax file numbers, low&hyphen;income earners, people who are getting payouts from work when they have been made redundant, all those people being caught up in a quite unnecessary and unanticipated way. Why do it in that form? We suggest the government think again and do it in a much more straightforward way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One thing that I guess would be of concern to many of those who are in the Public Service, if indeed the states come along and adopt this system and legislate to enable it to be implemented in the states, and all those in unfunded superannuation schemes, including all members of this parliament, is that he government is still not able to say what the actuarial principles will be upon which unfunded schemes will be taxed. I am told by the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) that those actuarial principles will not be known for some two months after the legislation has been passed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are being asked to do in relation to these matters, which affect many hundreds of thousands of Australians, is to buy a pig in a poke&mdash;to adopt a principle of taxation where the authors of the policy are not able to say how it will have an impact. Essentially, the incidence and circumstances where this will fall and the way in which it will affect individual members of such funds is completely unknown. That seems to be a very odd way to make tax policy, a very odd way to make superannuation policy and not a way which this House ought to be extremely comfortable with.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of these difficulties could be dealt with if the government simply had the straightforward initiative to say, `Yes, we are in breach of one of our election commitments.' It would not be the first&mdash;they are in breach of many of their election commitments&mdash;and it will not be the last. If they were prepared to simply accept that, on this occasion, they are in breach of their prior commitment not to increase taxation and not try to do this through a backdoor mechanism which is too complex and gives rise to greater problems than the device needs to generate, many of those problems would be worked out and overcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have an unnecessarily complicated piece of legislation to achieve a relatively simple policy objective. And at the same time it is contained within a framework of indifference to the overall superannuation objective. This really does concern the opposition and ought to concern members of the government. At the very least, there ought to be a strategic statement of objectives about how this government seeks to address the kinds of demographic and social issues that successive governments in the past have dealt with through superannuation policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The kinds of mutual commitments that were, until recently, the subject of bipartisan support need to be reviewed because the government simply does not support those matters any more. It had been, until recently, a matter of common ground across the chamber that both the opposition and the government saw the need for there to be such structural saving mechanisms built into the way in which Australia did its business. If that is not the case, the government needs to tell us what it will do to deal with the sorts of issues that the Commission of Audit raised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government needs to say, `If we did tell lies to the Australian public at the last election and say we would pay the $4.5 billion superannuation contributions that Labor had committed to previously and now we will not, this is what we will put in its place.' They need to say what kind of structural mechanisms they will build into our financial system to ensure that national savings objectives are generated and that we deal 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2788"> with generational costs which will otherwise become acute. It is not plausible to say that we can enable the present generation to avoid thinking about the future given the fact that when this generation, my generation&mdash;and even Martin Ferguson's generation&mdash;is old we will be old in a community&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. But when we are old we will be old in a community in which we are a much larger proportion than the elderly are presently. We need to make sure that structural arrangements are put in place and we need to make sure that we do not allow this government to slide away from articulating what it will do in the future, because these issues are far too large and significant to get lost in party politics and arguments about technical details.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We object on technical grounds to the way this legislation is constructed and who it will impose burdens on and we say that this is silly legislation, it is over complex, it imposes additional costs on the least well off in the community who will get accidentally caught up because they do not provide tax file numbers or because they take redundancy payouts. We also say that this government really has to articulate what kinds of savings strategies it is going to pursue and what kinds of long-term investment strategies it believes are appropriate for Australia, it needs to come clean on whether it believes Australia needs a population policy and say where it expects Australia to go and have some outlines of the expected demographics for where we will stand in 50 years time so that we can do some long-term strategic planning and long-term physical economic modelling of the way in which we have to provide for our citizens into the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These issues require that kind of long-term thinking. That was the kind of long-term thinking that we committed ourselves to through the superannuation initiatives built on over a series of elections and which the current government committed itself to maintain and continue when it was in opposition and when it went to the people and now is retreating from but without any clear sense of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> identifying what alternatives they are seeking to put in its place. That is why the greatest betrayal of public policy is not the shonkiness of the deal, not the fact that the government is trying to impose a tax without using the language of tax but the fact that they are walking away from a public policy initiative of such significance without giving any hint of what they would put in its place.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are tonight having a cognate debate on seven superannuation bills that impose a superannuation surcharge. It is really disappointing that in the area of superannuation we seem to have history repeating itself. I say that because it was the Menzies government in 1950 that destroyed the National Welfare Fund. I know, Mr Deputy Speaker Hollis, that you go to a lot of senior citizens' functions. People will often raise with members the fact that they contributed to their own pensions because when Australia had a fully funded national superannuation scheme called the National Welfare Fund, they were in it. Every pound of earnings required a contribution into that fund towards your old age. That fund was emasculated by the conservatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Labor came to government in 1983 only 40 per cent of the work force was covered by superannuation. When the highest marginal rate was 60 cents in the dollar, the rate of taxation on superannuation was three cents, because only five per cent of it was taxable. We get lectured by this government that they are introducing equity reforms into superannuation. I think you need to put it in the context of what we did. As I said, in 1983 only 40 per cent were covered. Now 90 per cent are covered. In 1983 only 24 per cent of women in the work force had superannuation. Now I think that figure is 85 per cent. So one thing that we did over 13 years was try to give superannuation coverage to the majority of the population, so that they would not be totally dependent on an old age pension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much has been said by the Treasurer, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), particularly during question time, about the 1993 election promises relating to taxation. The first thing that needs to be said is that we did introduce the reduction in the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2789"> taxation scales, as we promised. In other words, the first part of it was delivered. For example, the 38 per cent rate went to 34 per cent and the 46 per cent rate went to 43 per cent. It is true that we undertook in 1996 to introduce the second phase. But we did not do that. What we said we would do, and in fact undertook to do was, rather than giving people a further tax cut, to match dollar for dollar the contribution of those earning up to $46,000 by paying up to $1,000 per annum each and every year into their superannuation accounts. That payment phased out when earnings reached $65,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am staggered that the Treasurer and government members can get up in this parliament and say that they are quite comfortable with the idea that the Prime Minister, John Howard, is going to renege on that. What he is going to do is rip it out of their superannuation accounts and not give it back as tax cuts but put it in the government coffers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Looking at the legislation they have been bringing in, we see that they have paid off the banks. One election promise&mdash;core or non&hyphen;core&mdash;which has not been deviated from one millimetre is to establish retirement savings accounts. This means windfall profits to the banks and minimum returns for workers. They have made that electoral payment. We now learn that they are going to confiscate the second phase of Labor's proposed $4.5 billion worth of superannuation benefits; they are going to renege on that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tonight we are considering a further proposal that sounds really good in theory; that is, we are going to put a surcharge on those high income earners&mdash;everyone earning more than $70,000. Regrettably, a number of people who are not earning $70,000 a year are going to be caught up in that. That includes people who get redundancy packages and termination packages. These people are going to be affected, as are those whom the superannuation funds cannot contact. Assuming that 10 per cent of people cannot be contacted by their super funds, the industry estimates that over ome million people will be affected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The mechanism for dealing with the 355,000 people who earn more than $70,000 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is that superannuation funds have to provide the Taxation Office with details of 16 million separate accounts that they hold. Today in this parliament we heard the Prime Minister announce all these marvellous improvements designed to cut red tape. I cannot understand how you are possibly cutting red tape when, to be able to find accurate information on 355,000 people paying superannuation, you have to access 16 million accounts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In its first year, for people who are contributing superannuation, it doesn't matter whether you are at $70,000, $20,000 or $30,000, the impact is $100 million. All contributors are going to be required to pay that. The ongoing cost of that is estimated at $30 million each year. Over a period of time, a significant amount of money that would have been going to benefit people in their old age is not going to benefit them. It is going to be eaten up in administrative charges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a decent and honest way to deal with the government's shortfall of revenue. That is not to adopt this chicanery of saying, `This surcharge is a surcharge; it is not a tax.' Of course, it is a tax. The cleaner, more effective and efficient way would have been to increase marginal rates of taxation to collect that measure. But the government is not going to do it. It is taking seven bills just to implement this bit of government legislation. It has claimed that it is equitable, but a whole raft of people are going to be affected by that, not just those on $70,000. It is going to be people on termination payments, redundancy packages and golden handshakes. They will all be caught up with it, as well as those who have notified merely their employer about their tax file number and not their superannuation fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I regret that conservative history is that they destroyed the National Welfare Fund, a fully funded superannuation scheme, in the 1950s. And they are doing the very same thing now with the superannuation system that we have left in place that was going to add significantly to peoples' retirements. It was going to add $500 billion in national savings in the year 2000 and much more in the years to come. It is being strangled by this government by each and every successive measure.</PARA>

This effective package for superannuation arrangements and increasing national savings and providing a decent retirement then disappears.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a government without creativity but with prejudices. It has no creativity but it has a load of prejudices. It is as though they were Rip Van Winkles of the last 13 years. They understood nothing. They forgot nothing of the slights directed towards them. They learned the words but they never learned the music. They never internalised any of the intellectual arguments accepted by the community&mdash;generated from the community in some circumstances&mdash;that caused this country to be regarded as an interesting example of effective social experimentation by many other countries in the OECD, and by many people in the United States, on a whole variety of issues. They came out with the words they committed themselves to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nothing is more appalling than to watch the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) parade around the country now as though he has accepted his election undertakings. Part of that process that he knocked over was child care. They committed to the arrangements that we had put in place with child care; he annihilated them in the last budget. Part of the process was with the universal health care system. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Not a single decision that they have taken since they have been in office enhances that, and they have bungled the $1.5 billion rebate which could have transformed public hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They committed to opportunity and access to higher education by putting in place a system of arrangements inviting the universities to charge Australians full&hyphen;cost recovery in a variety of degrees, which in some cases will be well over $100,000. They put that out there as an example of what the cost actually is, creating a sense of unfairness in a proportion of the student body that is paying that amount, while at the same time increasing HECS to the point where students feel constrained from entering particular courses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On Friday evening I was talking to a very bright kid who has just entered university. He got a 99.5 rating in the New South Wales system, which easily qualifies him for medicine. He said simply, `I can't afford the uncertainty. I can't afford the HECS. I am going to be a lawyer.' God help us. He is going to be a lawyer. In this instance, we have taken one of the brightest kids you could imagine, who was not unenthusiastic about doing a university degree, and we are going to educate him towards malevolence on a grand scale as far as the rest of the community is concerned.

You produced a cure on the savings front to the chronic problem which has afflicted this nation since the 1960s, that is, our inability to save.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are a very lucky government; they are an extraordinarily lucky government. They have out there a jaded public that is switched off politics and a press which is operating on a 24&hyphen;hour memory as far as these things are concerned. If we sit down and look through a proposition like the work for the dole scheme that we will be debating later in this week, we see that it was introduced into the public arena, poll driven, chucked into the middle of it, and everybody operates, revolves and dances around it with a 24&hyphen;hour memory. It is as though Working Nation was based on reciprocal obligation. The Prime Minister even gets away with describing his system as reciprocal obligation. Where did he get those words from? He got them from Simon Crean, that is where he got those words from.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister even has the temerity to talk about reciprocal obligation to that and everybody who calls themselves a social analyst, at least in the media, is prepared to allow him to get away with it.

The government is not responsible for keeping the Labor Party's promises&mdash;not one of them. The government is, however, responsible for keeping its own. What makes the private savings of the nation a non&hyphen;core promise? What makes it so insignificant? The problem of dealing with our current account deficit, the problem of dealing with ownership of Australian industry, the problem of dealing with a decent retirement package for everybody now in their 30s and 40s&mdash;why is this so trivial that it is a non&hyphen;core promise? We say black means white when we see a proposition like this put forward by the Treasurer in February 1996: `A coalition government will provide in full the funds earmarked in the 1995&hyphen;96 budget to match compulsory contributions according to the proposed schedule.'</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2792">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other cute part of his explanation today was to say, `Aha, a revelation! What you did not tell the Australian people was that there would be a one per cent compulsory contribution from the wage earners&mdash;and then two and then three as the years go by.' You didn't tell them! The previous Prime Minister used to dance across the airwaves day after day telling them precisely that. The union leadership which took an interest in these matters used to dance across the airwaves day after day telling them precisely that. And that stately dance was joined by none other than the now Treasurer back then in February 1996 when he made amply clear that a coalition government would `match compulsory contributions according to the proposed schedule'. That was not our promise, not some promise put out there in the ether that descended unfortunately on the head of this new government as it came in. It was their promise, their undertaking to the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was a promise as core as anything else that they delivered or said that they would deliver after the election. What have they produced? They have produced a rebate of $1.5 billion&mdash;completely wasted. How are they going to pay for that shenanigan? To kill the savings of the nation, to kill the retirement of 30&hyphen; and 40&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds now who looked at the prospect of a retirement with an income more or less around the average weekly earnings that they now enjoy&mdash;whacking off the average 30&hyphen;year old now some $100,000 on the point of retirement and hoping to skate through this one by saying, `Well, it is not terribly relevant to them because it doesn't happen for another 30 years.' They are going to need a very quiet press on this one because as this becomes more generally known this government will stand monumentally condemned for this piece of electoral chicanery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today we saw the Treasurer in probably his worst question time that I have seen for some considerable time. But the other little piece of chicanery on the Treasurer's part was to try to claim that, with this particular exercise&mdash;I have already gone through the fact that he claimed it was an exercise&mdash;their savings vehicle would match it. Let us go through an analysis of what we know of their savings 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> vehicle&mdash;their savings vehicle that will partly pay for it. He was saying that they could only afford to do that because they had to deal with the black hole that was left by us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us reflect upon their last budget. Whatever claims they might make about the financial system they inherited, they announced to the Australian people proudly at the last budget that they had left sufficient way in the budget for the implementation of this promise in full. So the first cute explanation was, `We didn't make it, the dog ate our homework, we lost the promise. The second cute little explanation for the breaking of that particular promise was that it was somebody else's promise and they were not obliged to commit l&hyphen;a&hyphen;w law. The third cute little explanation for this exercise was that somehow or other they had a budgetary situation of our doing, not the budgetary situation that they have themselves confronted since the budget which they brought down last time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was a point of pride for the Treasurer. He does want us to operate on a 24&hyphen;hour memory, but I can recollect him getting up there offering his blandishments to the opposition spokesman on Treasury matters. He used to do it far more forcibly in those days than he does now. He would lean across the dispatch box and say, `Not only have we fixed up the budget deficit, but we are going to put in place your l&hyphen;a&hyphen;w law tax arrangements. That's what we're going to do.' This was not even before the last election; this was after the last budget. Up he got and said precisely that. So the third cute little explanation that he had here today for what it was that he was up to is out the window as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now we turn to the matters that are contained within this bill. These matters, of course, are not so serious in their impact on the nation's savings, nor on the opportunity for retirement for the average Australian, as are the propositions that they have foreshadowed for the next budget, but they are just as serious in their impact on the credibility of superannuation as a mechanism for saving. It is the first step in the subversive process, the first step in undermining the proposition. This step drives high income earners out of the superannuation arrangements. They are the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2793"> ones who can make alternative arrangements available for them. Therefore the savings are not going to be there in the public saving sense, but what will be there, for those who remain, is a whole set of arrangements&mdash;enormously costly to put in place&mdash;that will be recovered from the other members of the superannuation funds and diminish their benefit. All the battlers&mdash;all 15 million, or whatever it is&mdash;who are signed up now to these superannuation funds, one after another over the last few years, will be impacted upon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, of course, they are massively impacted upon by the practical activity associated with these measures which means that, when they do not put in their tax file numbers or if they are just an ordinary battler and they tot up a final payment that comes to over $70,000, on both those fronts, the so&hyphen;called wealthy, who are in fact the Australian battlers, will be the ones who are soaked. In other words, exactly the same people who are going to be skinned alive when it comes to this next budget are also the people who are going to bear the brunt of this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The superannuation funds, and others associated with the industry, have pointed out that there is virtually no response from individual fund members, from copious correspondence with them, because superannuation is not a system that they readily understand, they consider themselves to be in receipt of rote letters to which you never respond, and their lives are too busy anyway. They are going to be royally punished for that lack of attention when this particular bill goes through. What will happen to them at a minimum is going to be the loss of earnings that would have been there on that proportion of their income, which will be illegitimately taxed as a result. That may actually last for a very long time indeed in the case of a number of members and, even when they discover it, what they will not get back is the loss of earnings from the fund when that occurs. Various estimates have been placed on this but reasonable ones are that some one million Australian battlers are going to be the people who are worse off as a result of that.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, there is a point that ought to be made about this which goes to the competence of this particular Treasurer. I do not want to describe this fellow as a bloke completely without ability. He has some, but he is not a Treasurer. Maybe in another 10 or 15 years he would be a Treasurer. He is not one now. He is going to find over the next few days, as he has already found at the hands of Rose QC, at the hands of the premiers, at the hands of those who actually know something about this, that this is monumentally botched legislation, completely botched legislation. Not only is he destroying part of the nation's savings; he is destroying it incompetently. There is absolutely no clothing left on this particular emperor. This particular emperor has no clothes at all when he tries to claim a degree of expertise in this field.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He will get through this legislation. The nation will be the poorer for it and it will be even poorer still when the rest of his shenanigans as far as superannuation is concerned come to fruition. This particular part of it is going to bring him down 18 months from now as people come to understand what he has done to them and the superannuation funds descend in chaos. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say it was with much interest I observed the debate in the media over the past few weeks regarding the government's proposed superannuation surcharge for high income earners. I was especially glad to hear the Treasurer (Mr Costello) on Radio National a week or so back finally stating that it was time to call a spade a spade and concede that his proposed surcharge was in fact a new tax. Unfortunately, this concession appears to have been the only concession made by the government in relation to this matter, even though the proposal has been widely criticised by media commentators, the Association of Superannuation Funds, the Business Council of Australia, the Australian Chamber of Commerce, peak accounting bodies and various state governments to name but a few.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was particularly interesting to see Dennis Rose QC, an eminent constitutional authority, join the debate and state that he viewed the proposed legislation as unconstitutional and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2794"> likely to be found wholly invalid if subjected to legal challenge. Yet, rather than consider the various alternatives available with a view to implementing this measure in the most efficient and practical manner, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is adamant that his government will not back down on the surcharge and will press ahead with it regardless of the criticism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The irony is that criticism of the surcharge proposal is focused on perceived inefficiencies and ramifications with the way it is to be implemented and not upon the legislation's worthy objectives of making superannuation fairer by reducing the considerable advantage very high income earners receive by contributing to superannuation funds, but this law will drive those high-fliers into fringe benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Susan Ryan, the Executive Director of the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia, stated on 12 March that her organisation does not: `argue with the government's right to raise extra revenue, nor with their intention to tax high&hyphen;income people more in relation to superannuation, we are just saying: let's have a system of collection which doesn't create expensive chaos in the industry . . . ' Furthermore, on the same day, the Executive Director of the Business Council, David Buckingham, stated his organisation is not opposed to the surcharge as such. His concern is that the administrative arrangements proposed, in his words, represent `an administrative nightmare and will be very costly, very inefficient.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From my independent perspective, it worries me to see the government once again going down the path of putting into place legislation which will fail to achieve a worthy goal because of poor design and implementation. While the government may have clearly identifiable policies and objectives, it really does seem to be falling short on the implementation side of good government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One need only look at the example of the Austudy actual means test debacle; its admirable objective was to catch the rorters of the system and ensure only those families who deserve the benefit receive assistance. However, because the system was ineptly imple 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> mented and administered, the system backfired and ended up catching the very people the government should have protected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, recently in this House, I spoke on the government's proposed changes to the taxation laws to provide capital gains tax rollover relief for small business which would not benefit many small businesses and farmers who chose, like many do, to run and sell family companies with shares. Finally the government heard the message and announced the concession in today's small business package but, unless that legislation is amended, many thousands of genuine small businesses, whom the government undoubtedly intended to help, will not be helped at all. It is Clayton's legislation. Clearly, there are many people who view the government as making the same mistakes with this current piece of legislation as it did with these others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, last week Robert Brown from the Institute of Chartered Accountants said the proposed legislation reflected the knee-jerk way in which the government brought this in. He said: `It seems to be an ill&hyphen;thought out, last-minute initiative of the last budget which is just a grab for revenue.' Clearly, the legal ramifications have not been thought through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The argument I raised in the capital gains tax rollover debate is of equal relevance to this one. If a government is going to legislate, it makes sense that it does everything within its power to ensure the measures it introduces are capable of achieving its objectives in the most efficient manner and, of course, are constitutional.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With these measures, the government aims to claim a further $500 million in tax revenue by slicing up the 15 per cent extra off the super of those people who earn over $70,000 and who currently only pay 15 per cent tax on superannuation contributions. As the member for Moore (Mr Filing) said, it is a 15 per cent shift from savings to revenue. The proposal is justified on the basis that it reduces the generosity of tax concessions available to the better off. Its obvious political purpose, however, is to deliver a quick revenue fix while maintaining an illusion that no new taxes are being introduced.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2795">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposal, which technically has been operating since 20 August last year, aims to levy super funds rather than the individual contributors by asking the funds to provide the ATO with details of the money paid into the nation's 15.7 million superannuation accounts. The Taxation Office will then send the funds a list of the accounts from which the tax should be deducted. The super funds would then deduct the tax and hand the money over to the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's rationale for implementing the tax in this way seems based on two factors. Firstly, because the government is treating the levy as a surcharge and not a conventional tax, it could not collect it through conventional taxation mechanisms. Secondly, because the government feels the superannuation funds owe their very existence to government legislation and they already administer the 15.7 million superannuation accounts in Australia, they are, the government says, the logical mechanism through which to collect the revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Throughout this public debate, the government has argued that the super funds are the demons in this equation. Indeed, the Prime Minister himself has said that: `The superannuation funds are talking out of their pockets on this issue. There is nothing high and mighty or altruistic about that. Let's call a spade a spade: the funds are trying to destroy this because it affects them.' With all respect, the problem is that the Prime Minister and his government do not seem to recognise the inherent connection between super funds and their members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that the cost to a fund of administering such a levy&mdash;and the cost, estimated at $100 million a year, is considerable, to say the least&mdash;could not be incurred by the super funds without hurting their members. It is my understanding that super funds do not have independent sources of income to dip into. All of their profits and losses are ultimately linked to the value of their members' accounts. Accordingly, any expenses incurred by the fund would have to be paid for by the fund members&mdash;and that would mean all fund members, not only those at whom this new tax is aimed.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In effect, the government will be asking the ordinary fund users to subsidise the collection of the surcharge. Why? Simply because the government could not bring itself to call a tax a tax and collect it as such.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Besides burdening all members of the fund with the expense of administering the collection of the tax, another likely consequence of the proposal is that it will deter people from investing in superannuation funds. Apparently, this has already started happening, with a majority of chartered accountants advising their affected clients to move out of voluntary superannuation because of the surcharge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to a survey conducted by the Institute of Chartered Accountants, 35 per cent of accountants said they would be telling their wealthy clients to divert their funds to negatively geared property or shares, or into investment in equities. Twenty&hyphen;six per cent would be recommending their clients set up trust structures. Thirteen per cent would advise clients to pay off their mortgages, and 19 per cent would advise clients to limit themselves solely to compulsory superannuation contributions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Avoidance reactions such as these are undesirable and maybe they are unavoidable regardless of how the tax is implemented, but surely they cast doubt on the ability of the surcharge scheme to achieve the government's target of $500 million this financial year, and more in future years. While collecting the tax through the superannuation funds may be politically correct, it does appear to be an inefficient way to do it from an administrative point of view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although I do not claim, by any means, to be a superannuation expert, some of the alternatives suggested by the superannuation funds and the Institute of Chartered Accountants&mdash;which would have the collection administered through group certificate systems&mdash;do appear preferable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now return briefly to deal with some broader issues raised by this legislation. In particular, I want to look at the message this type of change sends out to people about superannuation. I also want to look at the issue of education about superannuation. From my perspective, superannuation exists so that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2796"> when people retire they will be able to maintain a standard of living above that achievable on the pension, until they die. In the long run, superannuation should benefit both the individual, by providing them with a higher standard of living, and the rest of society by not burdening society with the responsibility of supporting retired people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a country with an economy such as Australia's and an ageing population, it makes sense to have as attractive a superannuation system as possible. From what I see in my electorate, there is already a worrying degree of cynicism in relation to superannuation. Workers tell me that if only they could use the superannuation money they earned to pay off their mortgage, in the long run it would save them thousands of dollars&mdash;savings which could then be directed towards superannuation at a later date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me explain the situation of a small business operator in my electorate who is now over 60 and approaching retirement. He is about to see a large slice of his retirement savings creamed off. Let me read from a letter that he wrote, and in fact a copy was sent to Senator Rod Kemp:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">May I suggest you seriously look at making further exceptions in the case of people over 60 years of age. My reasons for making this suggestion are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Because I was self&hyphen;employed for the vast majority of my working life, I was unable to adequately superannuate myself.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) In recent years, having formed a service company so I became an employee of that company, I have been superannuating myself at a rate higher than normal in order to compensate for the previous shortfall.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Because my retirement is now imminent and because I have been working to a fixed plan, I consider your proposed surcharge, which I consider to be a tax, to be unfair to those people who, like myself, are not using superannuation as a taxation hedge but are genuinely trying to consolidate their lifestyle in their retirement.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There is a lot more, but that bit says it all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here we have a tax not only on those who could and should pay more, but on the hard&hyphen;working and thrifty people who want to look after themselves in old age because this government is too gutless to tackle the other areas of the economy where revenue is staring 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> them in the face. I refer to the massive tax&hyphen;minimised profits shifted offshore by companies masquerading as serious investors in this country. This is no crazy, anti&hyphen;multinational rhetoric. It comes from no less an authority than one of the government's business advisers on APEC, Mr Michael Crouch, who warns that foreign control of key industries is leading to massive profit shifting; that our beef is being bought by vertically integrated Japanese companies here at $15 a tonne and being sold at home for ten times that, with absolutely minimal tax paid here on their operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirty&hyphen;three per cent of our listed shares are foreign owned and $13 billion exits this country in dividends each year, as well as $11 billion to foreign banks. Why aren't imports taxed? Why aren't our financial screen jockeys taxed? Why are some of our own most powerful businesses paying such low tax? These are the questions of the so&hyphen;called battlers which both sides of politics seem to want to represent. These are the questions the battlers and the small business operators are asking of this government. And the only reason the polls are so favourable for the government is that there is nowhere else to turn, apart from Independents, because Keating looked after his mates, too.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You talk about savings on the government side. The Prime Minister talks about the need for foreign investment to sustain our standard of living and to provide jobs. What rot! How can you talk about the need for savings on the one hand and then tax the very savings that should sustain people in retirement, at their expense? If we were really serious about Australians investing in Australia, we would be looking at directed superannuation investment to restore the infrastructure in this country that has been wantonly and criminally run down over the past 20 years. Some funds, like the Rural Supervision in country New South Wales, are planning to target rural infrastructure. There are thousands of people out there prepared to put their money where their country is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Economically targeted investment in this country would work, for if we don't restore our national infrastructure and assets, or 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2797"> invest in our own value adding industry&mdash;wool, meat, export marketing enterprises, inland export airports, our own mineral resources&mdash;then someone else will. And that someone will come from overseas and those profits and that forgone tax will go overseas. This government, and the one before, and probably the one after, will run around picking up little PAYE or small business stones and squeezing a little more tax blood out of them, while ignoring the fat juicy coconuts bobbing off across the sea to some far distant shore.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill and this lack of revenue focus, this squeezing of ordinary Australians and ignoring of fat Australians and foreign leeches, would be the stuff of a banana republic B-grade movie plot were it not so serious. And, to top off this stupidity, the government is now talking about changing the rules by increasing the age at which you can access your superannuation. As far as I know, the average age of death for Australian males is somewhere in the mid&hyphen;70s and it is a bit higher for women. You do not have to be an actuary to work out that there will be many people who will die before they enjoy their money, or what is left of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While this new tax will apply to many wealthy people&mdash;to whom a 15 per cent tax might be neither here nor there and they will fringe benefit their way out of it anyway&mdash;its cost will be indirectly borne across the board. Therefore, such a change sends a worrying message out to all fund users, and not just the rich, that money put aside for retirement is now fair game for this and subsequent governments. How are workers to know that the goal posts will not be shifted again, and again, and again? Indeed, it is hard to imagine that by the year 2020, when there will be an estimated $2,000 billion under the management of super funds, whichever government is in power will not be trying to get its hands on a proportion of such a perceived goldmine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I suggest it is a fool's gold because taxing retirees&mdash;not the big end of town as the Treasurer suggests; I am talking about the small business operator whose letter I quoted&mdash;will erode their self-sufficiency at the very time they will constitute a huge fraction 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of our population: 24 per cent of our population over 60 by the year 2020. Such uncertainty could only make voluntary contributions to superannuation a less attractive alternative, which is worrying because the current levels of compulsory super are inadequate in themselves. Rather than implementing measures which create uncertainty and make voluntary superannuation a less attractive alternative, the government should be looking at ways of making it more certain and more attractive. The level of awareness in superannuation in the general community is also worrying. I believe there is a real need for the government to assist in educating the public about the need for superannuation and why it is compulsory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I commenced my comments with reference to the Treasurer and his recent admission that what he had called a surcharge was in fact a tax, I think it is appropriate to end with that, because from my perspective that is the foundation of all the problems. If the surcharge is simply an additional tax, the government should swallow its pride and admit it has broken its election promise of no new taxes. If the Treasury or the Treasurer want more taxes, let them look elsewhere because that source of income is there. It just takes a bit of courage to go after it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Incidentally, as these bills also apply to the Commonwealth and thus parliamentary superannuation, let me make it clear that I have no problem with a reduction in my parliamentary superannuation benefits, should I survive the period required to derive any substantial benefit from them. I firmly believe the current arrangements for politicians, the size of payouts and the ability to access them before retirement age, like the travel allowance payment system, send the wrong message to the tax paying public and are morally wrong. I hope the message from the Senate to this House tonight seeking a tabling of House of Representatives allowances is treated with the respect it deserves and is put on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like most members of the opposition, I find it quite disturbing to be involved in this debate on superannuation. Let me say that there are a number of points just made by the member for Calare (Mr Andren) with which I very much agree. We are dealing now essentially with the core bill, the Superannuation Contributions Surcharge (Assessment and Collection) Bill 1997, and of course another half a dozen items of legislation which are related to that bill and form a necessary part of the introduction of this package.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Calare suggested that by the year 2020 it is possible that acquisitive governments will look at the very large sums of superannuation funds that will be available and perhaps expropriate those funds for their own purpose. Let me say it has already happened because the provision of the former Labor government&mdash;the method of adopting that second tranche of the proposed tax cuts&mdash;was going to ensure that the second tranche of the proposed tax cuts would find its way into the superannuation entitlements of workers at the time they retired. Of course, the present government has now indicated, despite the fact that it gave a very firm indication that it would honour and pursue that particular proposal of the former Labor government, that it will not do that. So those funds, to which the member for Calare made reference, are funds which the present government has its greedy eyes on already and is taking advantage of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Calare also said that this surcharge is a tax, that it should be recognised as a tax, that it should be treated as a tax and that, if it were, it could be dealt with a lot more efficiently. He was perfectly correct in that observation as well. If there is any item of public policy about which the present government will become more and more discredited, it is quite clearly in this area of superannuation. This government has become 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a government of gimmicks: work for the dole and the Green Corps and the comments that were made during that farcical exercise earlier today that we call question time when increasingly we are getting government members acting like clowns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know there was sometimes criticism before about the number of questions asked during question time when Labor was in government, but at least the questions were answered. The former Prime Minister took advantage of the opportunity as well to make some justified comments about members of the front bench of the then opposition, the coalition opposition, but when he answered those questions he answered them with substance. We did not have him acting the clown. In fact, I am not going to dwell too much on this, but I am starting to wonder whether I will continue to come to question time&mdash;and I have been here for 17 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the present Treasurer (Mr Costello) answers a question seriously and sensibly&mdash;and I hope he or his advisers are listening&mdash;he can answer it well; but with this buffoonery, that he is hoping will masquerade as an effective presentation of public policy, he does himself no credit. I urge him to become a little more serious and not act the clown.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This approach of the present government to superannuation, which is represented by this collection of bills, reflects as well the coalition's lack of commitment to superannuation. We know that when the Labor government came in in 1983, for example, there were only about 40 per cent of all Australian employees covered by superannuation. It is now over 90 per cent. There were about 24 per cent of women employees covered by superannuation; it is now 85 per cent. That did not come about just fortuitously; it came about as a result of deliberate, intelligent, sensible public policy being introduced by the government over those years in order to ensure that two things eventuated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first one was that there would be adequate provision made for retirement incomes of people in a country which demographically was growing older and in which there was an increasing proportion of people finding themselves in the retirement age 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2799"> group. The second objective was to use the superannuation system and the sensible provision for retirement incomes of Australians as a means by which Australia's national savings could be increased.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are three ways in which that has already been attacked by this present government. The first one was the one I have just referred to in reference to some comments by the member for Calare, the fact that the government has abandoned its own undertaking to pursue the second tranche of the former Labor government's tax reductions which were to be fed into superannuation. The second one was to allow low income earners in Australia to opt out completely from the superannuation arrangements and the third one was this present one, this tax provision which is masquerading as a surcharge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been other attacks as well made on superannuation including the fact that the government now will be requiring people to start drawing on their superannuation retirement entitlement from about the age of 55. Superannuation now and in future will be substituting for sickness benefits, unemployment benefits and disability payments as well. So superannuation is not being used by this government as a form of retirement income; it is being used by this government not only, as the member for Calare suggested may be happening at some time in the next century, as a source of revenue and as a budget balancing device but, increasingly, superannuation is being used to replace other forms of welfare payments for people over 55.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government also is going to allow low income employees to opt out of superannuation arrangements. Instead, those low income employees are going to be encouraged to pocket the money, upon which they will be taxed. So those low income employees who at the invitation of the government may opt out, will not be better off; they will be worse off. Not only will they be worse off today; they will be worse off in the future as well in that period of time in their later lives when they are retired and for which there should be increasing provision made now by them, by government and by employers.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is using superannuation as a vehicle to enable it to increase tax on higher income earners&mdash;and that is the purpose of this package of bills we are considering at the present time. It is also using superannuation for other types of purposes like ingratiating itself with the banking industry by allowing banks to provide low growth, low return retirement savings accounts so that employees can be up to $200,000 worse off with their accumulated retirement entitlements over their working lives. We know now that there will be increasing attacks on superannuation in the May budget. There is a great deal of justified apprehension on the part of the community generally about the possibilities. All of this represents a lack of commitment on the part of the present government towards superannuation and towards the encouragement of national savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of very serious individual things which are wrong with this legislation. The first deficiency&mdash;and people have repeatedly made this point&mdash;in this legislation is that the legislation has been designed as complex as it is simply because the government refuses to go back on an ironclad guarantee that it gave that it would not increase tax. The government is increasing tax; it is increasing tax on those people whose taxable income is in excess of $70,000 a year. I simply ask: why doesn't the government own up to it? Who does the government really think it is fooling? It has not fooled itself; it has not fooled the opposition. I will present two comments that have been made. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 13 March, in an editorial, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The justification for the Government's superannuation `surcharge'&mdash;to reduce the generosity of tax concessions to the better&hyphen;off&mdash;is commendable.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The editorial goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But the real motive&mdash;to deliver a quick revenue&hyphen;raising fix on the Budget deficit without appearing to tax anyone&mdash;inevitably has led to a cock&hyphen;eyed compromise.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>  identifies it as a tax. The government knows it is a tax. The community knows it is a tax. We know it is a tax. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  on 11 March this year said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2800">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister, Mr Howard, has offered to consider changes to the $500 million&hyphen;a&hyphen;year Budget tax&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">emphasis on the word `tax'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">on the superannuation of high&hyphen;income earners as pressure builds on the Government to recast the entire policy.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Everyone knows it is a tax. If the government acknowledged it was a tax, it would have been able to introduce it in a much less complex way, a much more efficient way, a much less costly way and it would not find itself in the position where it is in effect launching an attack on superannuation to achieve objectives which have nothing particularly to do with superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we need any evidence that it is a tax, let us examine the following factors. It will be assessed by the Australian Taxation Office. It will be collected by the superannuation provider and remitted to the Australian Taxation Office. It will not be hypothecated for any reason; it will simply flow like any other tax into consolidated revenue. In the first year it is going to raise $434 million. That is going to rise in the third year to over $500 million. That is almost $1.5 billion in ordinary government taxation revenue over the three years. But the government claims it is not a tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That itself impinges on and defects the government's credibility that it believes it can continue to claim this is simply a surcharge and not a tax when everyone knows that it is a tax and everyone knows it is being introduced for tax purposes. The simple reason it is being introduced is to increase the tax on higher income earners in order to raise about $500 million a year to feed directly into the government budget. As I indicated, the chief reason for that was simply that the government had given an ironclad guarantee that it would not increase tax. It fools no-one. Obviously, all it intends to do is to supplement its revenue and to cover its outlays in any way possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam Deputy Speaker, you will recall recently that the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) was at least honest enough to admit that, as far as the government was concerned, the Medicare levy has nothing to do with health. He said that the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Medicare levy is simply a revenue raising device. That is not the way we saw it, but that is the way they see it, and the minister for health was sufficiently honest to recognise that and to admit to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In an unguarded moment on the John Laws program on 26 February the Treasurer, in reference to this so-called surcharge that he denies now is a tax, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the tax that is collected on employer contributions will be 30% rather than 15%.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In another unguarded moment, he responded to Pru Goward on Radio National on 12 March with these words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So this is nothing new that we're introducing in the sense of the contributions tax&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">again with emphasis on the word `tax'. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It's been operating for quite some time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Today during question time the Treasurer, in connection with the former government's proposal for the payment of that second tranche of the proposed tax concessions to be paid into superannuation, gave an example of what he considered to be a very complex arrangement for that process to be carried out. The complexity of this proposal, which this government has adopted simply because it insists on calling a tax a surcharge, is very similar. People who examine what the Treasurer said at question time today, with the necessary processes which are built into these arrangements, will recognise the point that I am making at the present time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If they were prepared to admit that this so-called surcharge is in fact a tax, all they would need to do would be to have the employer place all the superannuation contributions on the employee's group certificate, which is a very simple process. Secondly, the Taxation Office would match the superannuation contributions against the employee's taxable income and determine the superannuation tax liability. Thirdly, and finally, the taxpayer would be advised of the superannuation tax liability and could decide then how he or she would pay that liability. The advantage of that is that it would be transparent, it would be less costly, it would be more efficient, it would be simpler and it would apply 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2801"> only to those employees at whom this tax impost is directed&mdash;that is, those employees who earn $70,000 or more in taxable income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a tax. If it were treated as a tax, the superannuation fund would not have to collect the liability from the contributor's account and thus reduce his or her cover. The contributor could opt to pay the tax themselves and retain the higher value of their cover rather than have it just debited against their entitlement. Thus, the advantage to national savings would also be retained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is prepared to sacrifice all of those things simply because it wants to claim that the tax it is imposing is not a tax, because it said before the election that it would not introduce any new taxes or increase taxes. As I said, it is unnecessarily complex, it is cumbersome, it is inefficient and it is costly. In addition to that, it is estimated that it will cost about $100 million to set up the cumbersome reporting system, and then the annual ongoing operating costs are estimated to be another $30 million every year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those costs will represent a charge against every fund member of every retirement income arrangement. It is estimated that only about 350,000 high income superannuation contributors will be caught by this proposal&mdash;350,000 who earn $70,000 or more in taxable income a year. But how many accounts will have to be separately assessed to determine who those 350,000 are? About 16 million accounts will have to be assessed to see whether or not the people against whom those accounts act as a credit are people who are caught in this net. As I say, there will only be 350,000 of them. So, in effect, all of them will have to be assessed to see whether or not they are included.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The incredible thing about this is that it is simply not necessary. If the purpose is to collect more revenue from high income earners&mdash;and it clearly is, and I have no concerns about that&mdash;it would be easier, more efficient, more equitable and less stupid to build it into the existing tax arrangements. There is also the need to supply a tax file number to a superannuation fund. That is a serious invasion of privacy. It should not be necessary, and would not be necessary, if this 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> so-called surcharge were treated as a tax, which it is. All of those matters to which I have made reference, and others, simply reflect an appalling approach on the part of this coalition government to social policy, to public policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It represents, as far as superannuation is concerned, another vandalistic attack on the whole principle and structure, purpose and arrangements, of superannuation. This government is becoming a government of gimmicks. The Australian people will increasingly become aware of that. The Australian people will be particularly concerned about this government's approach to superannuation, because not only is it relevant and of enormous importance to Australia's capacity to generate savings but also it is relevant to Australia's capacity to generate appropriate retirement income arrangements for Australian employees. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></SPEECH>

As well, people who do not provide their tax file number to their super fund may also be hit with a surcharge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dr George Collins, the general manager of investments at the financial planner RetireInvest, outlined this tax in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Review</EMPHASIS> supplement to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of March 21 1997:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2802">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"You could be sailing along thinking you will be exempt from the surcharge until you find yourself in a position where other bits and pieces you might get during the year&mdash;some of which are expected, some of which are unexpected&mdash;might push you over the limit," he says.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">If employees switch jobs, resign or retire late in the financial year, they may mind that payments for annual leave, long service and any withdrawals of superannuation which contain a significant post-June 1983 component may cause their adjusted taxable income to rise above $70,000 per annum.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Dr Collins goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">If your adjusted taxable income is above the threshold, there is nothing you can do about it. You can't use imputation credits or anything similar which you can use with contribution tax, because it isn't a tax but a surcharge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Certainly, you will find some people will look at mechanisms by which they can legitimately claim significant tax deductions to bring their income below the level. The industry is already working on investment opportunities to provide this.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> , in an editorial which was submitted to the House by the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) a moment ago, has quite clearly defined this surcharge as a tax. In fact that editorial, of 13 March, said that the government have been caught with `their pants down over their poorly designed efforts to squeeze $500 million from the $7 billion in tax concessions that are weighted towards high income individuals.' The editorial says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They will remain uncomfortably exposed because of the demands to balance the Budget and their self-imposed inertia.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This proposed 15 per cent tax on high income earners and, indeed, low income earners as it turns out, is set to be one of a growing list of dismal policy failures proffered by this government. It is also believed by those on this side that the new tax is likely to raise perhaps something like less than half of the projected $500 million a year. On top of that, it will still fail to deliver anything like a fair and equitable superannuation system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The contention of those on this side of the House is that this surcharge is set up to be an absolute flop. The state governments will not collect it, and accountancy firms, as I have just mentioned, are already examining methods for high income earners to get 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> around it. The Institute of Chartered Accountants indicates in its survey that nearly 75 per cent of its member accountants will advise their clients to move away from superannuation into other more lucrative forms of investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The indications are that the tax, even if it is constitutionally valid&mdash;and many speakers before me this evening have raised the question of the contentions of Rose QC&mdash;would probably collect less than half of the projected $500 million. After taking away an exorbitant $100 million in administration costs annually, as the member for Charlton again has said, the tax looks extremely inefficient, cumbersome and costly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 15 per cent tax fails to deliver anything like a fair and equitable superannuation system because it does not reduce the extremely excessive tax burden faced by low income earners with superannuation. Under the government's superannuation tax proposals, an employee earning $60,000 per annum will still receive a 33c in the dollar tax break on superannuation while an employee earning considerably less, say $20,000, will get just 6c in the dollar. That will be on top of a reduction in the investment income of their superannuation accounts as the funds absorb the $100 million cost of collecting this 15 per cent superannuation tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These measures are simply bad policy. They are an absolute disaster for all members of superannuation funds and for the industry itself. Mr Costello, the Treasurer, pretends that only high income earners will be adversely affected by these bills. Nothing could be further from the truth. All members of superannuation funds will, inevitably, be confronted with higher fees and charges and, hence, have their final superannuation benefits slashed. So the general claim of the government about insulating middle and low income earners is an absolute furphy. It is simply a farce. Ironically these measures, as proposed, will significantly increase the complexity of calculations for tax payable by superannuation funds while simultaneously boosting the income of unrelated professions, notably actuaries, accountants and financial advisers, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2803"> especially in the area of remuneration packaging advice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those who would be hit are notably, as I have said, high, middle and low income earners. It was announced in the last budget that some 355,000 high income earners would be affected, this being the biggest revenue raiser in the budget, which was projected to return some $1.5 billion over the next three years commencing this financial year. Collection is purposely via superannuation funds rather than, as it should be and as the member for Charlton has again quite correctly said, via the existing tax system through an administratively efficient group certificate mechanism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Opposing this particular surcharge&mdash;or tax, more to the point&mdash;are a range of financial industry and industrial heavyweights. Numbered among those are the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia, the Business Council, the Metal Trades Industry Association and the Institute of Chartered Accountants. All believe that the collection method for this tax will be inefficient and expensive. This is compounded by the fact that states such as New South Wales, Queensland and South Australia say that they will be unlikely to collect the surcharge on behalf of public servants, judges and politicians, claiming it will either be in breach of the constitution or will cost them additional money to collect which, again, will come off the final benefit received by the potential recipients.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Superannuation giants such as Jacques Martin and AMP have warned that failure by low income earners to provide their tax file numbers to their superannuation funds could result in as many as two million people being unfairly walloped by this tax. The government has already had to exempt Federal Court judges from this new 15 per cent tax due to constitutional issues that arise out of section 72. It is interesting to note that the Treasurer made no mention at all of that in his budget speech of last year. Recently, during deliberations by the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation on this tax, the states made it known that they continued to hold a number of constitutional doubts relating to the way the Commonwealth can levy taxes on the states.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The situation may well arise where public sector employees would not be required to pay the surcharge. Up to, and possibly in excess of, 25,000 state public sector employees may be allowed to avoid the superannuation surcharge while Commonwealth employees, their counterparts within the federal jurisdiction, and private sector employees would be required to pay the 15 per cent tax. Even if the Commonwealth were able to somehow convince the states, by convoluted and contorted legal argument, to legislate in their own houses of parliament to collect this 15 per cent tax, it would be very doubtful to say the least. The constitutional questions relating to both sections 114 and 51(ii) would, no doubt, prevail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The design of this surcharge is intended to levy a tax on the individual on the basis, as I have said before, of annual adjustable taxable income and then to collect the tax through a third party, notably the superannuation fund itself. During the aforementioned hearings of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, evidence was presented from the Business Council of Australia by Dennis Rose QC, a name that has been mentioned on several occasions in this place during this debate. Rose QC is the former Chief Counsel for the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department. The advice that he presented to the committee related to section 51(ii).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst he was in broad agreement with the states regarding the issue of tax discrimination he presented an argument to suggest that the entire superannuation tax transcended the parameters of the existing taxation powers. He believed that it is beyond the parameters of the Commonwealth's powers and the tax is different from the 50 per cent contribution tax which currently applies to contributions made by employers on behalf of employees to their superannuation funds. This contribution tax is levied against the fund and is on a different plain paid for by that fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The QC's opinion perhaps best described as buttressed by the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department where, as I have said, he was the former Chief General Counsel has completely altered the public's perception of this surcharge. In fact no longer does the public debate go to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2804"> the question of the surcharge. The debate now goes to the question of the complex and costly collection arrangements for this tax. This debate is perhaps only understood by relatively few people in the superannuation industry. It is now simply a matter of: is it law or is it not? Those of us on this side of the House would contend that it is now not valid law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the advice of Rose QC turns out to be correct, as we on this side suggest it may, and the whole scheme is found to be unconstitutional then no revenue will have been collected, but the enormous implementation costs will have been spent by the industry by that time. On that basis, we in the opposition would contend that the Treasurer would be duty bound to resign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That brings me to the question of the role of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in this fairly scandalous exercise. His role is one of ongoing dishonesty. He is refusing to be honest with the electorate and confront the electorate at large with the views proffered by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> and other notable journals in this country which quite clearly have in their editorial submitted that it is a tax and not a surcharge. The Prime Minister does not want to tell the electorate that he has broken one of his cherished core promises not to introduce any new taxes. That is something, as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) said earlier this evening, he pounded the opposition with earlier this year that post&hyphen;budget he would not break this core promise by introducing a new tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what this 15 per cent so-called surcharge is. It is a new tax. It is a tax on individuals which is calculated on the basis of their taxable income and their superannuation contributions. The government do not want it to be transparent and therefore they are requiring superannuation funds to pay it on behalf of individuals. If the funds paid it on behalf of individuals then it is my understanding that the government believe that people will not notice this new tax&mdash;a new tax described as a tax by stealth. It is a surcharge masquerading as nothing more or less than a tax. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Due to the government's dishonesty, arrogance, incompetence and a range of other adjectives that have been used this evening in describing the handling of this policy program, it has placed its entire $1.5 billion worth of estimated revenue in doubt. As the member for Moore (Mr Filing) quite simply said, this is a transfer from savings to revenue. On that basis, it is certainly unwise and unsound economics. It could potentially create an additional new Costello crater in the budget bottom line, already widening that which he has exposed in recent months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In concluding, can I say that this legislation is perhaps unique in the political history of our country. It combines an absolute, blatant repudiation of a cast iron election promise, which was not to introduce any new tax, with a steadfast refusal to, in any reasonable way, acknowledge this breach. It imposes on the government and superannuation funds massive blow&hyphen;outs and increases in compliance costs. It imposes upon superannuation members a reduction in benefits and it completely alienates the superannuation industry, many members of which are members of ASFA. It also alienates accountants, financial advisers and actuaries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is with a view to keeping these people on side that the opposition will look to move amendments in the Senate not only in their interests but also in the interests of low and middle income earners who have been particularly slugged by this iniquitous, cumbersome, costly and inefficient charge. I urge those in the other place when confronted with any amendments that are proposed by the opposition to support them wholeheartedly.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is fair to say that any quick browse of the newspapers over recent weeks will show that this budget initiative of this government has proved to be a bit of a disaster. As the hour is late and as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) has very effectively blown out of the water any credibility that might have been contained within this package of bills or any credibility it might have 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2805"> enjoyed, I think it is only necessary for me to be very brief.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This package of superannuation surcharge bills is really an extraordinary one and has attracted the anger and ire of all those in this country that know anything at all about superannuation and taxation, including a few people from the government's own back bench. The government's package is extraordinary because I think it breaks just about every rule of good public policy. I want to run through just a few of those.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">First of all, the package seeks to deceive&mdash;something the Australian people, as you know, Madam Deputy Speaker Crosio, do not appreciate very much at all. Secondly, its constitutionality is, at very best, doubtful. The member for Isaacs (Mr Wilton) and a number of speakers before him have made reference to that constitutional advice, and I do not need to go over it again now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, the package clearly and blatantly breaks a number of pre-election and post&hyphen;election promises, including one that is post&hyphen;budget. The biggest promise of all that it breaks is that ironclad commitment from the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) that no new taxes will be introduced in the first year of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fourthly, the package is inequitable and will hit many more people than it purports to target&mdash;those people earning more than $70,000 per annum. Finally, it undermines one of the most critical strategies for overcoming this balance of payments problem&mdash;that is, the strategy to boost national savings. Already tax experts are advising their clients, as the member for Isaacs has pointed out, to seek alternatives to superannuation as an investment strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Superannuation was once something only available to those working in the public sector and those chosen few in the private sector on very high incomes. That was the situation when the now Prime Minister was Treasurer of this nation. We ask: what were those chosen few paying in terms of tax on superannuation? It was around a maximum of three per cent on lump sum payouts.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former Labor government, in contrast, successfully turned all of that around. Through the award and the superannuation guarantee systems it made superannuation available to all working Australians and, as you know, Madam Deputy Speaker, was about to do much more. But at the same time the former Labor government turned the tax arrangements for superannuation on their head leaving in place sufficient incentive to invest in superannuation, to invest in our public infrastructure, to invest in our nation and in our nation's children, while at the same time making or leaving the system equitable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former Treasurer, now dressed in PM's clothing. wants to turn all that around and vandalise the system for basically two reasons: firstly, because he can claim no credit for a very good system; and, secondly, because he has some budgetary problems and some promises he is unable to keep. This package of bills will ensure that while coalminers in my electorate, who work long and hard on unusual and difficult shifts and often in dangerous conditions, will have no choice but to pay the superannuation charge&mdash;or the superannuation tax, which I should call it&mdash;white-collared workers with the capacity to access the right advice will simply avoid the tax by rearranging their superannuation or remuneration package circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Make no mistake about it: we are not just talking about high fliers. Many of my constituents who work those long hours in coalmines under difficult circumstances earn well in excess of $70,000. Do not let us delude ourselves that these people are well off. They are ordinary working Australians who put in a hard day's work for decent reward. They do not deserve this extra tax slug, particularly as they were promised prior to the election that they would be safe or quarantined from any future new taxes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will mean tens of thousands of ordinary Australians who earn less than $70,000 but do not appreciate the importance of submitting their tax file number to their fund manager will also be hit by the superannuation tax. That will mean that all fund members, regardless of their means, will be hit by this tax due to the fact that they will all share the burden 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2806"> of the astronomical administrative cost that is attached to the scheme. The legislation represents a new red tape burden on Australia's small business operators&mdash;another broken promise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The package of bills and all the rhetoric from the other side that has accompanied it epitomise the dishonesty of this Prime Minister and his government. I want to say something about that. While I do not like to admit it or recognise it, it is a simple fact that within a large section of the Australian community there is a very strong perception that this Prime Minister is a very honest man when it comes to public policy. I do not doubt that perception exists. But I also want to say this: any popularity this government enjoys is underpinned by that perception. That perception is the only thing holding this government together.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to assure the Prime Minister that that perception is changing very, very quickly and it will continue to change. As I move around my electorate I feel the change and it will continue to change as all these budget initiatives begin to bite. As you know, Madam Deputy Speaker, many of these budget initiatives have not even taken effect yet and therefore have not come close to biting out there in the Australian electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can assure the Prime Minister that, when the initiatives begin to bite, those polls, which are causing him to be so cocksure at the moment, are going to change very quickly. This package of bills before the House tonight I think epitomises that public policy dishonesty. I commend to the House the amendments of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans), which I think very adequately highlight that point.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to conclude this superannuation debate and go over some of the issues which have been raised during the debate. First of all, in regard to the application to the states of the constitutionally protected schemes, the current surcharge bills cannot apply to constitutionally protected schemes operating in some states. The government is consulting with the states to achieve a fair and workable outcome in respect of these schemes. We are confident about the constitutionality of this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, in regard to alternate collection mechanisms, the proposed mechanism, outlined best in detail in chapter 6 of the report of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> superannuation contribution details would be provided via group certificates prepared by Employers;  
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2807"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> contribution details would be included in annual income tax returns lodged;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the ATO would levy surcharge as part of the annual assessment;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the employees would meet the surcharge by&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">&hyphen;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> offsetting the surcharge against any tax refund due;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">&hyphen;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> paying the surcharge directly; or</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">&hyphen;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> passing the liability to the superannuation funds to make the payment.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I note that this proposal has a number of serious problems, indicating that the proposal has not been adequately considered. Employers are not in possession of all the data necessary to be given to employees in their group certificate. Employers would need to get information from the superannuation fund, for example, the exact details of the superannuation fund&mdash;its name and tax file number&mdash;together with the member's superannuation account number. If the employer does not have the details of the contributions, the funds would have to supply these details.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under current law, employers must give group certificates to employees by 14 July to avoid interfering with income tax lodgment cycles. However, funds asked for extension of time to report to the Australian Taxation Office beyond 31 August, as originally envisaged, as this date was claimed to be difficult to meet. The funds now have until 15 December to report to the Australian Taxation Office&mdash;in the first year of operation. How are employers supposed to meet an earlier date? In addition, employers using defined benefit funds would be unlikely to have an actuary calculate the surchargeable contributions prior to 14 July each year. The employer's group certificate would need to include the amount of the superannuation contributions. Funds will have to report surcharge information to the Australian Taxation Office for compliance purposes. This means that the mechanism would not remove the superannuation funds from the reporting requirements. The costs of changing employer payroll systems and tax agent systems would be significant. Proponents of the alternative measure claim that it would be cheaper. How can that be so when it will involve 900,000 employers and 10 million taxpayers?</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third point raised was in regard to advance instalment. The advance instalment is raised in advance of the actual surcharge assessment, not in advance of the contributions being made. For example, contributions received from 20 August 1996 to 30 June 1997 will have surcharge assessment raised in the 1997&hyphen;98 financial year. The advance instalment payment on 15 June 1998&mdash;only 15 days before the end of the financial year&mdash;relates to contributions received in the 1997&hyphen;98 financial year. Credit of the advance instalment is applied against the actual surcharge assessments, which will arise in the 1998&hyphen;99 financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fourth point raised was in regard to revenue concerns. Revenue aspects of the bill are as follows: 1997&hyphen;98, $480 million; 1998&hyphen;99, $470 million, and 1999&hyphen;2000, $530 million. These figures were reflected in the budget statements. There is no missing revenue. The figure of $434 million in the financial impact statement of the explanatory memoranda refers to the estimated surcharge liability in respect of contributions for the 1997&hyphen;98 financial year rather than the estimated budget receipts, which I have just reiterated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fifth point raised was tax file numbers. Superannuation funds are now collecting tax file numbers from members. They have been doing this under a new law which came into effect on 16 February 1997. The Australian Taxation Office will be undertaking a range of measures to minimise the number of people who will have the surcharge imposed just because they did not quote their tax file number to their fund. These include: data matching, direct communication to people who have not quoted a tax file number, notices in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tax Pack</EMPHASIS> and information which will be provided by the Australian Taxation Office for inclusion with annual superannuation fund statements, reminders on income tax assessment notices, assessments delayed until 15 May 1998; and, lastly, superannuation providers will be allowed to advise the Australian Taxation Office of tax file numbers received after the 15 December reporting date. This means that members will have until May 1998 to provide their tax file number to avoid 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2808"> a surcharge assessment. Where the taxpayer subsequently quotes their tax file number, the surcharge will be refunded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The surcharge bill allows funds to obtain tax file numbers through an `opt&hyphen;out' method. If an employer has a person's tax file number for superannuation purposes, the employer can advise the employee that they will pass on their tax file unless the employee objects. The employee has 30 days to make this decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lastly, the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) raised a question towards the end of his speech. He asked whether the proposed legislation suggests that the super tax will be applied to the proceeds of the sale of a small business if it exceeds the threshold amount. The answer to that is no.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In finalising this summary, I makes these the points about this legislation: this is an equity measure; it is about a surcharge on people with incomes of $70,000&hyphen;plus. As a government, we believe that this is an important measure to bring about increased equity within the superannuation and taxation systems. Not only that: it is still a very attractive investment&mdash;contrary to what people have said&mdash;and we believe that people will continue to invest in superannuation. It is not, as some people have indicated, now an unattractive way to invest. I would like to conclude on that and to thank those members who participated in this debate.</PARA>

We are just taking clauses 1 to 33 together at the moment. Without going into all of the details of the amendments relating to those clauses, I would just make these comments, which cover nearly all of these amendments to this bill. These amendments make a number of technical changes to ensure the equitable application of the superannuation contribution surcharge, by applying the surcharge to exempt public sector superannuation schemes and allowing for the appropriate calculation of contributions paid to defined benefit schemes. The amendments also remove any

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to hear what the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) has to say on the subject of clause 34, which is now being omitted from the Superannuation Contributions Surcharge (Assessment and Collection) Bill. The only explanation being given is that this amendment to omit the particular clause removes any doubt about the constitutional validity of the bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make the point that an explanation is required from the government in this respect because this, of course, is the clause that led Dennis Rose QC to put into the public domain his legal opinion saying that as a consequence of the existence of this particular clause the whole bill was in fact unconstitutional. Without going into the detail of his opinion, the gist of it was that clause 34 as it is presently drafted operates in the context of a bill which imposes the tax on the provider, that is, the superannuation fund, but clause 34 makes it possible for the provider to reduce any benefits accruing to or for the member by way of recompensing itself, in effect, from the member. It is probably easier simply to read clause 34:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Superannuation provider may reduce member's benefits on account of payment of surcharge or advance payment</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">If a superannuation provider makes a payment under this Act in discharge of a liability of the provider for surcharge or advance payment on a member's surchargeable contributions, then, despite anything in any trust instrument, contract or other document or any legislation, the provid 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> er may reduce any benefits accruing to or for the member after 20 August 1996 by the amount paid. </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What clause 34 is doing is thus conferring an authority upon the provider to reduce the benefits accruing to the member&mdash;in other words, conferring an authority on the provider to recompense itself for the payment of the surcharge by way of collection from the individual member.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What Mr Rose QC says is that this is beyond the taxation power of the Commonwealth because what you've got in the bill as a whole is the imposition of tax on person A, that is, the provider, but a requirement in clause 34 for another person, person B, that is, the contributing member, to actually pay  the amount of the tax to the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the government has done, confronted with this particular constitutional opinion of Mr Rose, is to purport to solve the problem by removing the clause altogether from the bill. I cannot forbear from making the point that in doing so, of course, the government is spectacularly at odds with the Treasurer's own assertions when this matter was first raised that there was no problem at all constitutionally with the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the point was raised by Mr Rose in public and this proposition was put to the Treasurer he said, for example, on ABC radio <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> on 12 March:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It's certainly not the advice that we've been given. Our own lawyers have obviously had a look at this. They were aware of the point that's been raised by Mr Rose. They drafted the Bill to come within the terms of the constitutional power. So they're not surprised by this; it's not the view they take.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Costello would not then or subsequently release his own purported advice on this subject. The truth of the matter is that this amounts to a concession&mdash;a confession, if you like&mdash;by the government that they were in error on this, as in so many other things in the drafting of this particular bill. What we have in this particular clause is a confession of that error of a most humiliating kind, albeit tucked away in an otherwise fairly impenetrable list of amendments and with an utterly non&hyphen;helpful explanatory memorandum just making the point that there is a constitutional issue here.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2812">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I finally make the point, however, that I have real doubts and the opposition has real doubts as to what the workability of the bill will now be in the absence of clause 34. Can the parliamentary secretary advise us how many trust deeds around the place at the moment do in fact make provision in the absence of a clause like clause 34 for recompense to the fund from the member's contributions? Is it the case that that is a universal state of affairs, in which case clause 34 is genuinely redundant and the bill can do without it? Or is it the case that in the absence of clause 34 there will be quite a number of superannuation funds around the place in respect of which the trustees will not be able to recompense themselves from the individual members, in which case presumably either the trustees individually will bear the pain of this particular tax impost or, alternatively, the fund membership as a whole will somehow, by virtue of its being charged to the fund itself rather than the individual members, have to bear the pain of it, notwithstanding that the tax is only to be imposed on higher income earners?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have sought the advice of the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department in regard to the views which Mr Rose has put in regard to these matters which have been raised by the opposition spokesman. Our view is that the amended bill cannot be invalidated on the grounds which he has raised. We are confident about that. We are very confident that the amended legislation, with the removal of clause 34 together with other amendments, does cover any concerns about the constitutionality of this legislation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government says that there are no and were no constitutional problems associated with the existence of clause 34. However, actions speak louder than words and the fact that the government has chosen to delete this clause in its entirety is a fairly spectacular concession, as I said earlier, that there were, in fact, constitutional problems, that they were of considerable magnitude, and that the Treasurer (Mr Costello) was misleading this place and the public in suggesting otherwise. This is a rather humiliating retreat we are seeing from the government. That point has been made. Given the lateness of the hour, I am not going to repeat it endlessly but it ought to be noted for the record.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the real point of my intervention&mdash;and I hope the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) is focusing on this now because I am going to ask him again&mdash;was to say, `Setting aside the constitutional problem, is there a practical problem in the workability of the legislation or in the fairness or equity in the operation of the legislation in the absence of clause 34? Can you simply rely on the existence of provisions in trust deeds allowing the superannuation providers to reduce the contributions of the individual contributors? Can you rely on provisions in practice in those trust bills? Are they universal? Are they the case in all existing funds?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you cannot rely on that being the case, will it not be the case that there are another whole set of problems that arise in the operation of the legislation, namely problems arising from the inability of the trust deeds&mdash;the inability of the funds themselves, if you like&mdash;to recoup from the individual members? Given that you are not talking about an even, across&hyphen;the&hyphen;board impost upon contributing members, but that you are talking about an impost that varies with the individual income of the members, it does therefore raise a quite serious practical problem in the fairness, equity and practical working of the funds if, indeed, it is the case in the absence of pro 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2813"> posed section 34 that that matter can be attended to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you say other legislative instruments somewhere will enable the individual members' contributions in effect to be docked in this way to cover the cost of the tax, those other individual legislative provisions would presumably themselves raise constitutional problems. It does not much matter where in the legislation the provision for recompense comes, whether it is in clause 34 or somewhere else in this bill, or whether it is in some other bill. The question is whether the scheme as a whole involves the imposition of a tax on person A but provision for recovery on person B. I think we do need an explanation of whether or not there will be practical problems of this kind. Until we get such an explanation&mdash;I won't further pursue the debate tonight&mdash;we will certainly be indicating our opposition to the passage of this clause.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very briefly, we do believe it will be able to be applied equitably. We do not have any doubts about that. I can understand the opposition spokesman raising these issues but the advice we have is that it can be applied equitably. We do not believe there will be any problems in that. For your information, there is nothing to stop trust deeds from amending their trusts, which is another aspect to that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One last word on this question: I am not particularly happy with the position that the poor old parliamentary secretary finds himself in. Once again, the Treasurer (Mr Costello) has failed to come into this place to argue through the provisions of his own bill. He leaves it to his poor benighted junior to confront the questions that are raised. I make the point that if the government is going to want this measure passed in this form in the Senate it had better come up with a rather better explanation, with

That was proven to be a totally fraudulent gambit and now, I suspect, there are some undiscovered problems that exist here. We are merely saying that if there is nothing in the trust deed to enable it the trust deed can be fixed. I would like to know how many trust deeds will require that attention before this legislation is practically workable, along with all the other elements of this which make it so obviously and manifestly impracticable and unworkable.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;After that edifying explanation of what the amendment is all about, might I just rise and say that what it is about&mdash;we are told in the explanatory memo and on the face of the clauses&mdash;is that there is provision here to ensure that the bill does not impose a tax on any property of a state or impose a superannuation contribution surcharge on a state where this would exceed the legislative power of the Commonwealth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have here is a situation of the Commonwealth, forced again by constitutional necessity, which was denied again by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in his public statements on this when the issue was first raised by the states, retreating and putting in a provision to ensure that a bill which was constitutionally doubtful as written would, in fact, survive constitutional scrutiny. The particular constitutional issue in this case is the applicability of this surcharge legislation to state public servants earning above the $70,000 statutory minimum threshold that has been identified for this policy, of whom it appears there are some 25,000 in the state public sectors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason the constitutional problem arises, as this amendment acknowledges, is that it is a source of  constitutional difficulty for a piece of taxation legislation to purport to directly tax state property. Here the state property is in the form of superannuation funds. If the legislation was simply left to bite directly upon those superannuation funds without some exemption of provision or without that application being severable, the bill would indeed be unconstitutional. Thus the necessity for this particular amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That necessity was not acknowledged by the Treasurer when this matter was first raised 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2815"> publicly. Again, this particular amendment involves something of a humiliating retreat for the government in acknowledging that there is yet another problem with this legislation. Here, as elsewhere, this problem only arises because the legislation is constructed in the manic, obsessively complex way that it is&mdash;as a tax basically directly on the funds rather than on individuals collected in the ordinary way through individuals' tax returns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the legislation was constructed in this way&mdash;if this surcharge was frankly acknowledged to be a tax on individuals and collected as such through individuals' tax returns&mdash;the problem simply would not arise so far as the state public servants or state public sector fund members are concerned. The constitutional problem would not arise any more than it does with any other form of Commonwealth income tax biting on state public servants. That is perfectly constitutional if you are taxing individuals. The problem arises when you tax property&mdash;that is, the superannuation funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We were told by the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) in his wrap&hyphen;up second reading speech earlier on this evening that the government is consulting with the states to achieve a fair and workable outcome in respect of these schemes. In other words, the Commonwealth is bypassing the legislative route here and is engaged in a familiar exercise in negotiating with the states to try to get them to cough up by other means the amount of the tax that will be owing if this legislation is passed on the state funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The likely response of the states to this so far was well articulated by Mr Max Evans, the Minister for Finance in Western Australia, who was reported on 12 March as saying, `The surcharge is a bad idea. The federal Treasurer should tear it up and start again.' He said that in so far as Western Australia was concerned it was not going to cooperate in raising the super surcharge in the Commonwealth government's scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know whether there has been any further advance on that degree of lack of enthusiasm so far as the states in general are concerned, particularly Western Australia. I

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the process, you may have the result of 25,000 or so senior state public servants around the country being, in effect, exempted from the operation of the surcharge and thus another level of manifest inequity introduced in this along with the other remaining constitutional problem&mdash;that is, the immunisation of Federal Court judges from the application of the tax, again because of the crazy way the thing has been established.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a measure of a democratic society that access to the law is equally available to both the richest and poorest in the land. It is clear from the decision of this government on legal aid that access to the law will be available only to the wealthy. Today I delivered to the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams)&mdash;and there is a copy of it here&mdash;a cheque for $12.56. This cheque was the proceeds of a lamington drive conducted in the Illawarra by the Illawarra Friends of Legal Aid. I congratulate all associated with the lamington drive and the thousands of Illawarra residents who signed the petition that I have also presented.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will be a sad day in Australia when we need to conduct lamington drives to protect access to justice for all Australians. It will be an even sadder day when, through this government's stubbornness and its desire to cut and hack into funding for vital community programs, a lamington drive is the only way that Australians, especially the poor and disadvantaged, will be able to protect their interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The funding cut to legal aid is yet another example of this government's punishment of the poor and disadvantaged and a rewarding of the wealthy in our society. The legal aid 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> funding cut is just another in a very long line of funding cuts in child care, health, education, labour market programs, migrant assistance, public housing and social security. There will have to be many hundreds of thousands of lamington drives conducted in Australia to help save these essential community programs. I have attended two public rallies over the last few weeks in the Illawarra to protest against the legal aid funding cuts which the government, through the Attorney-General, stubbornly refuses to reverse.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have eaten a lot of lamingtons and very, very good lamingtons they were too, I might say, hence the weight. The Attorney&hyphen;General has been placed under pressure from the states and territories. These governments have sought consistently to have this government change its mind and restore the funding for legal aid. But the cuts themselves are misleading because they have been determined by using the 1994&hyphen;95 figures instead of the 1995&hyphen;96 figures which ripped $100 million from the legal aid system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Howard government made a promise at the election that it would maintain funding in real terms. It should be held to account for this promise. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and his Attorney&hyphen;General did not go into the last election saying that to try to save health, education, housing, labour market programs and social security you had to go out and organise the community to hold lamington drives. That was never a promise in the platform. The promises were not made on the ability of people to make and sell, and indeed to eat, lamingtons. The continuation of legal aid funding represents a paltry percentage of total government outlays in the defence of Australia's democratic principles: access to justice, equality before the law, the presumption of innocence, the right to a fair and impartial hearing and the capacity to enforce and uphold civil liberties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Three hundred thousand people in New South Wales have been offered assistance by Legal Aid in community legal centres. I have one excellent centre located at Warrawong in my electorate. If these cuts proceed, 70,000 people will have no access to justice this year, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2818"> nor the next. On an annual basis, 70,000 people&mdash;the weakest people in the community: children, women, the aged, the mentally ill, the disabled and the isolated&mdash;in New South Wales alone will all suffer because of this government's stubborn resolve not to ditch an unjustifiable decision. The Attorney&hyphen;General has publicly expressed the opinion that legal aid funding is about Rolls Royce treatment of just a few people. Let us have a look at this view. Of more than 82,000 applications for legal aid in respect to crime charges, only 4,503 proceeded to hearing, 4,001 cases were finalised for less than $5,000, with less than one per cent of cases costing more than $30,000 at trial or hearing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is time that the lamington drive platform of the Howard government is put to rest. The community should not have to sell these items at the local stall on a weekend to help save vital community services. I should not have to present a cheque, symbolic or not, to the Attorney&hyphen;General in a campaign to try to get him to change his mind to reverse the legal aid funding cuts. Once again, like so many others before me, I call on the Attorney&hyphen;General to reverse these savage cuts.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="2818"><TITLE>Aboriginal Heritage Protection</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984 very properly aims to protect significant Aboriginal places and items that could be endangered. For example, perhaps a bulldozer might be inadvertently about to push down a tree with a carving on it or it could be that some items are going to be sold outside of Australia. It is a very important act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1987 there was an amendment to the act which brought in a Victorian section: part IIA. This contains provisions quite different from those applying to the other states. For example, it includes inspectors who are given delegated authority under the act, as well as a three&hyphen;part protection process. The intention of the act is that there be an emergency declaration made for up to 30 days. That is followed up by a temporary declaration if the problem persists and, finally, a permanent protection is put in place. Under stages 2 and 3, the permanent and temporary declarations, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> there is a right for the affected parties to have arbitration and appeal&mdash;and of course that is only right and proper. If it is a permanent declaration, compensation is available for the affected parties because it could involve some loss of property or amenity to them. All of that is absolutely reasonable, and the act is, as I said before, significant and very important for Australian Aboriginal heritage protection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The trouble is that there is a drafting glitch. There is a time bomb buried in section 21C(3)(a) of part IIA, the Victorian section. It is totally unintended, but it allows the Aboriginal inspectors who declare an emergency situation to in fact spin over that emergency declaration stage 1 time and time again, making it so that those affected cannot appeal. There is no arbitration mechanism. The affected parties are stopped from carrying out any activities or planning over the area placed under the emergency declaration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is of extreme importance to me at the moment in the electorate of Murray. At Kow Swamp a local cheese factory, Kraft, intended to build a pipeline to dispose of some of their wash water. They doubled the size of their factory recently and invested many millions of dollars. That factory employs some 250 people. It is the only industry in the area. A big irrigation area is dependent on the manufacturing carried out by that factory. It exports most of its product. It is of great significance in my local area. There are also many farmers in that area, of course.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 2 August, Kraft received an emergency declaration under this act from a local Aboriginal inspector representing the Yorta Yorta people saying that they were to stop any plans to build this pipeline to a property that they had acquired at the other end of Kow Swamp. At the same time, some farmers received the same declaration saying that they were to remove their cattle from areas of their properties and leasehold areas around the lake forthwith or be fined or imprisoned. They were, of course, quite stunned by these moves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They immediately tried to negotiate with the inspector and the Aboriginal community that was represented by the inspector. In fact, so concerned were they that the Victorian 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2819"> state government, who administers this act, conducted a special audit of the heritage values of the area under the emergency declaration, and it has brought down a report which says there are no items of heritage value, no places at risk, in these areas that are under emergency declaration. However, the act is silent on what to do when you have a vexatious situation like this. This emergency declaration can simply be replaced again and again every 30 days or so or at will.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to amend this act. It is essential because, in the hands of vexatious people, it is a time bomb. It is a weapon to be used against people who are powerless. I am not talking about all Aboriginal people, just a very small number of people who are acting vexatiously at this time. I believe we need to amend this act urgently, and I will be looking at a private member's bill to do that shortly. An urgent solution is of enormous significance to the Australian people because this act is now being brought into disrepute by the actions of one or two people.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="2819"><TITLE>East Perth Redevelopment Project</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening I would like to make some brief remarks about a Better Cities project in my electorate of Perth&mdash;the East Perth redevelopment project. Better Cities was a program instituted and implemented by the previous government and, unfortunately, in the run-up to last year's budget the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) indicated that no further funds would be made available for that program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The East Perth redevelopment project is an inner city redevelopment project. East Perth is perhaps most famous for  the presence of the WACA&mdash;where a travesty of justice is currently occurring&mdash;but other than that has in more recent years largely been an inner city semi&hyphen;industrialised area. The East Perth redevelopment project seeks to turn East Perth into a residential area. The Commonwealth contributed $32 million and the state of Western Australia $68 million to this project. Whilst the state contribution was significant, it was clear from the outset that the project would never have gone ahead but for the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Commonwealth's commitment and the Better Cities program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The contract between the state and the Commonwealth, which was signed in the early 1990s, had a clause for the provision of affordable housing in East Perth. People interested in the East Perth project, including members of the state government at the time, were concerned that there was a danger if no provision for affordable housing was made in the agreement that East Perth might become an enclave for the rich&mdash;a Nedlands or Dalkeith equivalent in the inner city on the river.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The agreement between the state and the Commonwealth provided that a key objective of the East Perth redevelopment was to increase housing choice and affordability. It provided that dwellings for public and special needs housing be purchased and developed and that a program be initiated to establish a mechanism for the provision of affordable housing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, it has been very difficult to get the state government, the current Court coalition government, to meet its affordable housing obligation. Since early 1995, my state parliamentary colleague, the state member for Perth, Diana Warnock, and I have been pressing the state government to meet its affordable housing obligation under that contract. The approach and attitude of the state government has been one of avoidance and denial&mdash;the usual defence lawyers trick.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The avoidance was first to say that the state was happy to provide affordable housing provided the Commonwealth paid for it under the Commonwealth's social housing subsidy program. When that approach was rejected by the former minister for regional development, the former Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Howe, the state adopted the approach of denial. Mr Howe was successful, with urging from me and Diana Warnock, in extracting a commitment from the state Premier Richard Court that a 15 per cent affordable housing component would be provided in East Perth. That comes in at roughly a couple of hundred houses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, the current planning minister, Graham Kierath, has said in respect of East Perth in a letter which I have obtained 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2820"> through a publicly interested member of my electorate:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Authority is not obliged to provide any affordable housing under Building Better Cities Agreement with the Commonwealth. A separate draft agreement was negotiated in 1995 between the State and Commonwealth to provide shared equity, rental and community housing. This agreement required Commonwealth funding, however this funding was cut in the 1996/97 budget.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite this the Authority will provide land for up to 50 dwellings to providers of affordable housing or housing for people with special needs. A non&hyphen;market mechanism will be used at considerable "opportunity cost" to the Authority.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is in stark contrast to the commitment given publicly by the Premier of Western Australia in 1995 at the opening of Claisebrook Cove that a 15 per cent affordable housing component would be provided. Some $100 million of taxpayers' funds for a capital development project! That ain't bad for 50 houses. The view of the current state minister that the state government has no obligation to meet its affordable housing obligation to East Perth and to the Commonwealth is legally wrong, morally wrong and ethically wrong. Together with my state parliamentary colleague, I will be taking whatever steps I can to ensure that the state government meets its affordable housing contractual and policy obligations to the East Perth redevelopment.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="2820"><TITLE>Defence</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The events in Papua New Guinea in recent weeks highlight the importance Australia that must continue to accord its defence forces. It has shown just how tumultuous and how changeable our region is and that our defence forces must not only be well trained but well equipped and be ready at any time to respond to our defence needs. It is not enough to quarantine defence, as we have done in our 1996 budget and will continue to do, as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has said, in the 1997 budget to be delivered in May.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also important that Australian taxpayers and the Australian soldiers, sailors and airmen all get the very best that they can from every dollar we spend on defence. I question that this really is the case today. The Channel 9 program <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> highlighted last weekend 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> some deficiency in the defence procurement process and project management. In particular, it drew to the attention of the public the JORN project and the purchase of two ships which, having been purchased, were found subsequently to have considerable rust which had been undetected, costing some tens of millions of dollars to the Australian taxpayer which we had not considered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it is not only major projects that Defence has struggled with. Like yourself, Mr Speaker, I too spent a good deal of time in the defence forces and one of my duties was as a trials and evaluations officer. That was back in 1984. At that time one of the projects being worked on by the infantry development staff at the infantry centre in Singleton was the general purpose boot, not exactly the most highly technical piece of equipment but, as they say, an army marches on its feet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sad reality is that after 15 years of research and development we still do not have a boot suitable for Australian soldiers. It certainly looks good on a parade ground and it works very efficiently around the barracks but, after all, our defence forces are meant to be able to work in all terrain and all weather conditions. We saw that in the recent exercise Tandem Thrust. This boot does not meet those conditions. It is hard for the soldiers to operate in. It is not suitable for long distance marching.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point I wish to make is that the GP boot is something which can be found on any army's feet throughout the world, yet we have spent 15 years developing something which is readily available off the market shelf and still we have not yet perfected it! It seems that the defence forces are very good at not only reinventing the wheel but then going on to further trial and evaluate that wheel to determine that, yes, the wheel will go round and be efficient. Then we will decide whether we will purchase it. I believe that we have wasted a great deal of money and have hindered the equipment that our soldiers have as a result of this procurement process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are another two other issues I would like to mention about Defence at this time. One is our level of command structure. In 1986 we had some 26,423 other ranks, pri 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2821"> vates through to warrant officer class one. That compared to officers from second lieutenant through to our senior office of 4,362, about a 14 to one ratio of officer to other ranks. Today we have 19,316 other ranks as at 30 June 1996 and some 4,360, just two fewer, officers. That is now a ratio of one to five. So why do we need such a high structure of officers to other ranks? </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here in Canberra there are literally thousands of Defence personnel, yet only 60 of those people are directly involved with operational command. We now see that the Defence Force is moving towards a new command structure, Headquarters Australian Theatre. I believe the principal oncosting of that is to ensure that the defence cost is no greater than the combined cost of the land, air and maritime commands. All that would seem a logical step but only if we then downgrade or scrap the role of land, air and maritime command, but I do not see that happening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that we have a very small defence force with a very big command structure, an unwarrantedly large command structure. To bring that parallel into focus I draw on some figures from Great Britain. Understandably, they have a much greater defence budget than us, some four times greater. They also have four times the overall manpower&mdash;that would be a logical conclusion. But when it comes down to line battalions, we have four and they have 11&mdash;a structure of more than 10 to one. It is the same for armed regiments. We have less than one armed regiment and they have 11. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired) </EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I take the opportunity to talk about a couple of aspects of life in the ACT which I would like to bring to the attention of this House. Things are pretty tough, as I have said on numerous occasions in this place, in the ACT. We saw again in newspaper reports that house prices are remaining down and in fact dropping against the national trend. The economy here is in a pretty tough state at the moment. </PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But there is a positive side to our community which I think we need to recognise and pay tribute to, despite the difficulties they find themselves in. We have in the ACT an excellent licensed club industry. They are employers of large numbers of people. They run excellent training programs for young people and all of the clubs in the ACT, big or small, contribute very generously back to their community. They, along with a lot of other industries in the ACT at the moment, are finding it extremely difficult to continue with that sort of work because of the economic pressure they find themselves under.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I would like to bring to the attention of the House tonight an example of how, despite those difficulties, when something unpredictable occurs in our community the club industry is very quick to respond with the community in which they operate. We had a very tragic event in my electorate a few weeks ago when a young woman in her early 20s, I think she is 22, suffered a very violent attack. As a result of this violent assault, she received burns to 45 per cent of her body on her upper torso and face. She was in fact set alight by her assailant. She is now in the burns unit at Concord Hospital in Sydney. She is from the Laotian community&mdash;a community which celebrates a very good lifestyle in the ACT.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Needless to say, the impact on her family, as well as the community of which this young lass is a member, was immense. But it was very quickly recognised that some assistance was needed to help Monia in her treatment and recovery and to help her family through this very difficult time. So one of the large clubs in my electorate the Tuggeranong Valley Rugby Union and Amateur Sports Club got together with leaders from the Laotian community which I might add, even though it is a reasonable size, is not one of our biggest ethnic communities here, and in a matter of days arranged a very large fundraising effort. The reason for this was quite simple and quite evident&mdash;that is, because of the length of time Monia is going to be in Sydney, her family basically closed up the house and moved there to try to support her and do what they could to help.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2822">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was recognised that some financial assistance was needed. Hundreds of people attended this function. They came from the Laotian community primarily. They came from near and far, from Sydney and from all around the region and from the ACT. It was a pleasure to walk into that room that evening and see not only a thousand or more people gathering to help out, but also the ethnic mix in that room.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The club, and particularly Mr Barry Masters, organised and sponsored the event. Many thousands of dollars were raised. The last I knew the amount was just under $9,000, but I have not heard the most recent tally. The community wish Monia a speedy and full recovery and, to her family, all the support and encouragement they need in getting through this difficult time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The main thing that we need to note is that, despite things like economic downturns and difficulties in getting through tragedies like this, we in the ACT&mdash;as I am sure elsewhere in the country&mdash;enjoy a wonderful community spirit, which at the time that it needs to demonstrate itself has no difficulty in doing so. It is a good thing to ponder and to take time to recognise the efforts of people like Mr Masters and the staff, particularly at that club, and the organisers on the Laotian committee executive here in the ACT, and to congratulate them on having the initiative to get together so quickly to organise something so difficult so successfully.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I notice in my calendar that we will be celebrating Laotian new year on 12 April in the ACT. I don't think we could wish Monia a better Laotian new year than a successful, speedy and full recovery. My congratulations to everybody concerned in this community effort.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="2822"><TITLE>Stanwell Tops Hanging Swamp</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to bring to the attention of this parliament a threat to a unique wetland area in my electorate of Hughes at the northern end of the Illawarra escarpment, midway between Sydney and Wollongong. It is known as the Stanwell Tops hanging swamp and is an area of outstanding scenic beauty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a relatively small but regionally significant wetland, recognised as a botanical, educational and scientific resource, and mainly under the ownership of about two landholders. It falls within the Stanwell Park coastal conservation area classified by the National Trust and, as such, is relevant to the coastcare program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Briefly described, Hargraves Creek rises about two kilometres west of the rim of the Illawarra escarpment at Stanwell Tops, drains through the hanging swamp to the scenic and historic mineral pool on the rim and then plunges over the cliff waterfall, down the escarpment through littoral rainforest gullies, through to the Stanwell Park beach northern lagoon. The lagoon and beach are popular visitor destinations, surrounded by an amphitheatre of lush green hills and Bald Hill, a venue for world championship hang&hyphen;gliding events.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These spectacular areas will doubtless be on display to the world during the Sydney Olympic Games as scenic drawcards. A world&hyphen;class walking trail is being constructed linking the Royal National Park southwards to the Illawarra escarpment and ultimately to Ulladulla. This trail passes the hanging swamp, which is therefore a vital link in the chain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Valiant efforts have been made over the years to safeguard the Illawarra escarpment and this wetland. Wollongong City Council commendably pioneered a fair trade policy for that purpose. This policy allows some development entitlements for trading of other lands to the Illawarra State Recreation Area but, in this case, it has been inadequate. Despite all the good intentions, this wetland is now under imminent threat from an unsewered development application for six lots only a few metres from the swamp. This would inevitably lead to ribbon development along most of the northern edge of the wetland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It not only makes good ecological sense to preserve this wetland from more unsewered development, but it makes economic sense due to the concerns over increased hard surface stormwater run&hyphen;off affecting the stability of the Illawarra railway line below the escarpment in an area renowned for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2823"> landslip problems. This is the most expensive section of railway line in Australia, consuming enormous amounts of taxpayers' money to protect it from landslip.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">State Rail has had deep concerns about impacts on the stability of the rail line below the escarpment through altered water flows from extra hard surface areas and diversions from this high rainfall area. This section of the rail line is notoriously unstable and costly to maintain, thus the resources of other state departments should be involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The small Hargraves Creek catchment is within the Stanwell Park coastal conservation area and is classified by the National Trust. Thus, coastcare federal and state wetlands policies should reasonably apply. It would be a massive blunder not to initiate negotiations to acquire the handful of lots involved to protect this precious swamp, the walking trail, the railway line and the Stanwell Park beach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In accordance with Senator Hill's statement that it is time for the federal government and the states to work together to save what is left of our wetlands, I urge our government to immediately commence negotiations to preserve this wetland to a complete creek catchment basis as a loop walk of the walking trail through public acquisition. Otherwise, it will become another wetland lost. It would be a sad day for Australia when the combined resources of the federal and state governments could not acquire a mere handful of lots to preserve this very small but very precious wetland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following on from Senator Hill's welcome announcements, and before it is too late, our government should take up that relatively low cost pledge and safeguard the significant stretches of spectacular Illawarra escarpment for the benefit and enjoyment of all Australians and future generations. I look forward to some positive and urgent action on these important issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of my constituents, Mr Maurie Dowson of Stanwell Tops, has worked tirelessly and hard for many years to protect this excellent and unique wetland of high regional significance and has worked with other dedicated local identities as the Illawarra Escarpment Coalition. To date, they have been successful 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in their efforts to preserve this delightful area. I look forward to some positive and urgent action from our government on these important issues.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) (a) I am advised by Airservices Australia that in the tender process for purchase of equipment in 1995, SAR Pty Ltd tendered a per unit price ranging from $4,500 to $3,600 (depending on volume) for precision Aerial Delivery Systems (PADS) equipment, $1,250 for storpedos, plus $435 for each static line.

In some States and Territories, however, the condition was notifiable during only a few of those years. It is highly likely that the vast majority of the 10,870 cases were due to Ross River Virus (RRV), and that most of the remainder were due to infection with the closely related virus Barmah Forest Virus (BFV), which causes similar symptoms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ross River Virus (RRV) was first isolated and named in Queensland in 1963. Epidemics of disease, now recognised as probably being due to the virus, have been recorded since the 1880s and have occurred  in all parts of Australia. The

As part of this research, DSTO has investigated microwave radiation as a method both of detecting and of clearing these types of landmines. I understand that the research indicates only some types of landmines, in particular mines which contain electronic circuitry or large amounts of microwave conducting material, can be detected and/or neutralised with microwave radiation. The majority of plastic mines, however, contain no electronics and little or no conducting material and remain unaffected by microwaves, particularly when buried. On the other hand, the use of radar at some microwave frequencies shows more promise. Nevertheless, I have asked DSTO to investigate whether the particular New Zealand development should be followed up.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I am aware of press reports that the combination of a wet winter, high river levels and late summer rains and flooding in some parts of Australia have resulted in a high number of mosquitoes responsible for transmitting Ross River virus. I am advised that such increases in mosquito populations are known to occur from time to time and do not necessarily represent an effect of long&hyphen;term climate change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Responsibility for action in the control of mosquito and mosquito&hyphen;borne disease control lies primarily with the States and Territories. I am advised that, in the areas currently at risk of Ross River Virus and other serious mosquito&hyphen;borne infections, State and Territory health authorities are undertaking action to clean up breeding sites for mosquitoes and to inform the public about how to reduce the risk of being bitten by mosquitoes through the use of mosquito avoidance and self&hyphen;protection measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth role in the area of mosquito&hyphen;borne disease control is in monitoring and coordination and in the support of appropriate research. Surveillance and coordination are undertaken through the Communicable Disease Network of Australia and New Zealand (CDNANZ), which includes representatives of the Commonwealth, the State and Territory health authorities and other relevant bodies. The funding of research into mosquito&hyphen;borne diseases has been provided by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC). For research on  Ross River Virus funds totalling $1,156,510.00 have been allocated over the past 8 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I am advised that the issue of forecasting the future dangers to Australians of  mosquito&hyphen;borne viruses was addressed by the NHMRC in their 1991 report, "Health implications of long&hyphen;term climate change". This report notes that it is difficult to predict the effects of climate change on the incidence of mosquito&hyphen;borne disease, particularly as infection with many of the viruses may not result in clinically detectable illness or symptoms. Although there is a theoretical potential for outbreaks of malaria and increased incidence of other vector&hyphen;borne diseases resulting from climate change, surveillance to date has not shown such a trend.
