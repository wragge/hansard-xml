<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the parliamentary Standing Committee on Primary Industries, Resources and Rural and Regional Affairs, I present the committee's report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Managing Commonwealth fisheries: The last frontier</EMPHASIS> , together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JT4">Mrs BAILEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report that I table today represents more than eight months of inquiry by the Standing Committee on Primary Industries, Resources and Rural and Regional Affairs into the management of Commonwealth fisheries following the referral by the House of audit report No. 32 1995-96 <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Commonwealth fisheries management: Australian Fisheries Management Authority</EMPHASIS> . The committee not only examined the issues raised by the ANAO but also took the opportunity to examine broader issues such as the recreational sector, surveillance and monitoring, accountability and the need for effective national leadership. The committee took this decision in order to provide a confident future direction for a valuable industry that has been subjected to intensive review and changing policy in the past decade.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The largely unexplored, underresearched, dynamic and complex marine environment of the nine million square kilometres of the AFZ makes managing fisheries a daunting task. In fact, it is the last frontier. AFMA has developed a partnership model for management of fisheries, and the committee believes that the management advisory committees, MACs, are pivotal to this management process and can be improved.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The partnership approach means involving all  legitimate stakeholders,
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> including the recreational sector where appropriate. The committee believes it is necessary to protect key stocks for recreational fishers as well as provide access to commercial species for commercial fishers where this is ecologically sustainable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The majority of the committee has therefore recommended a ban on the take and possession of blue and black marlin by the commercial sector in the AFZ, a tag and release program for blue and black marlin caught by recreational fishers and the non-issuing of area E permits to the commercial sector. The majority of the committee believes those recreational fishers defined as commercial operators who realise significant financial benefit from managed fisheries should contribute to the management costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The high level of by-catch and dumping is a real threat to sustainability and assessment of fish stocks. The government has allocated almost half a million dollars towards research and policy development to reduce by-catch. The committee has further recommended the trialling of cluster quotas and the introduction of surrender provisions to reduce the high level of dumping at sea by commercial fishers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In order to achieve ecologically sustainable development of fisheries, controls on the level of harvesting stocks, research into assessment of stock levels and knowledge of marine biology and habitat are critical. The committee has recommended that research needs to be better coordinated and that the FRDC receive its funding on the same basis as other industry R&amp;D corporations. The aim of the committee in making its recommendations has been to ensure the interests of all participants are fairly represented and that the resource on which they depend is effectively managed and protected for future generations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, in the brief time allocated this afternoon I would like to thank all those who made submissions to this inquiry, committee members, the secretary of the committee, Ian Dundas, and Justin Winton. I commend the report to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very disappointed that so little time has been allocated for members of the Standing Com
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5962"> mittee on Primary Industries, Resources and Rural and Regional Affairs to speak on this report. I believe their work has been extremely well done in starting to deal with the complex issues that face fisheries management. Eight months work needs more time to be heard. I thank our chairman, the member for McEwen (Mrs Bailey), for allowing me some of her precious five minutes to speak on the report on behalf of the opposition. I would also like to thank other members of the committee and the committee secretariat, which has done a good job putting the report together.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of major recommendations in the report that go beyond the examination of the audit report on AFMA. These include seeking to discourage by-catch dumping through recommending surrender provisions so that those fishing have to declare their by-catch. We have also sought to include recreational fishing, in particular game fishing and charter boat operators, as making up an important sector of the industry in terms of revenue generation. Up to now they have not been seen as part of the industry and really need to be considered as part of the overall industry because of the tourism and recreational potential of this area. The committee has sought recommendations to protect key stocks for recreational users while providing access to commercial species for the commercial sector where this is ecologically sustainable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All industries have their cowboys&mdash;the ones who are in this industry are totally without regard for any other aspect of the industry&mdash;who are not prepared to cooperate with any management. This makes it very difficult for those who wish to do the right thing and want to improve their fisheries. We also have had a very fragmented management structure across the states. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XU5">Mr LIEBERMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the committee's report on its review of the Australian National Audit Office's phase 2 audit of the efficiency and effectiveness of the administration of ATSIC's community development employment projects. The committee tabled its report on the ANAO's phase 1 audit in December 1996. The committee was pleased to learn that the government has in effect agreed with the committee's recommendations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The CDEP is a very important scheme. It has contributed significantly to the economic and social wellbeing of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples over the 20 years of its existence. Indeed, in many remote areas CDEP projects are the main source of employment for indigenous people. Given that large amounts of moneys are expended under the scheme, reviews and audits such as that carried out by the ANAO have an important role in ensuring a well&hyphen;managed scheme. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The committee found that the ANAO's recommendations are fair and appropriate. ATSIC has endorsed all the ANAO recommendations. The committee was pleased to find in the course of its inquiry that ATSIC has already taken a number of steps to address the issues raised in the recommendations. In addition, the committee was pleased
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5963"> to find that ATSIC has worked closely with the ANAO, as well as with the Department of Finance, in progressing its operational planning mechanisms and in developing its performance indicators and performance information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee has put forward a number of recommendations of its own with a view to bringing about further improvements. The ANAO's audit encompassed the administration of the CDEP scheme. It did not extend to a fundamental questioning of whether the scheme's organisation and form remain as appropriate today as in earlier years when it was far more modest in size. The committee is interested in some of these broader issues. It notes an independent review of the CDEP scheme recently requested by the Expenditure Review Committee of cabinet. This review is expected to make recommendations to enhance the scheme's outcomes and make sure it remains relevant to the needs of indigenous people and their communities. The committee looks forward to the results of that review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee considers that ATSIC should undertake a number of pilot schemes involving the contracting out of administrative tasks and responsibilities as part of its assessment of its current model of administration. The committee was concerned to learn that on occasion serious management failures in CDEP funded organisations may not be getting the attention from the responsible regulatory agency that they deserve. We have therefore recommended that ATSIC bring such failures to the attention of the relevant Attorney&hyphen;General as well as to the regulatory agency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that the Queensland Public Accounts Committee and the Commonwealth Joint Committee of Public Accounts are presently reviewing the financial accountability requirements for Queensland Aboriginal councils and Torres Strait Island councils in their dealings with Commonwealth and state funding agencies. We wish the committee well in their endeavours. I would like to thank all committee members for their valuable contribution to the inquiry, the committee secretariat and particularly the inquiry secretary, Mr Robert Walters. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to focus my comments on just two areas: firstly, the administration of the CDEP scheme and, secondly, the outcomes generated by the scheme. Both areas have a bearing on the effectiveness of the me. Whilst this is almost universally held to be a very valuable scheme, I agree that periodic reviews of the effectiveness of its administration are warranted, given the scheme's growth over the years and its current size. Similarly, the effectiveness of the scheme in terms of outcomes generated needs to be reviewed periodically.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is clear that ATSIC has made great strides in its administration of the scheme over recent years. ATSIC has taken serious account of the ANAO's performance audit as well as various other reviews of the scheme undertaken in recent years. I was pleased to hear that ATSIC is similarly committed to addressing the matters raised in the ANAO's phase 2 audit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to bring to the attention of the House an interim report of 3 April 1997 by ATSIC's office of evaluation and audit on an evaluation of the CDEP scheme. This evaluation has established that program participants have derived considerable employment, income, training, and social and cultural benefits from the CDEP program. CDEP participants were found less likely to be problem drinkers or to have been arrested in the last five years. In addition, they were more likely to have a stronger sense of cultural identity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I expect the recently announced independent review of the scheme will confirm its contribution to the economic and social wellbeing of indigenous peoples. In carrying forward the findings of the office of evaluation and audit's interim report, I trust it will also be able to identify ways to enhance the scheme's outcomes still further. I acknowledge the work done by Mr Robert Walters from the committee secretariat and the whole of the secretariat in preparing the report. I commend the report to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories, I present the committee's report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A right to protest</EMPHASIS> , together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ordered that the report be printed.</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AE4">Mr NEHL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of this inquiry was to review the arrangements which apply when people wish to protest at Parliament House and other areas of national land. That includes the Lodge, the Australian War Memorial, Canberra airport, the embassy area, Commonwealth offices and Defence facilities. The committee has adopted a minimalist approach to ensure that the right to protest is not diminished in Canberra.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While some people proposed a more structured approach to dealing with public demonstrations, through permits or a formal notification system, the committee considers that such options would be overly complex and unnecessarily restrictive. Instead, we have put our faith in the Australian people that they will exercise their right to protest in an orderly and peaceful manner and will shun the violence we witnessed last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The clear message we received from many contributors to the inquiry was that Australians do not want or need a system which unnecessarily increases the controls or limits on their right to protest. The committee agrees. Our recommendations focus on en
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> couraging cooperation between protesters and relevant authorities to ensure the proper planning and conduct of public demonstrations at Parliament House and on other parts of national land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nevertheless, in adopting this minimalist approach, the committee agreed that there is a need to tidy up some of the rules which apply to protest structures. During the inquiry, we heard about many problems which have arisen when people have sought to erect structures in support of their protest. The structures have included tents, sheds and even a Trojan Horse. It is important to recognise that there already is a requirement for people to seek approval before they can erect a structure on national land, but the law is unclear and open to testing in the courts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As acknowledged by the committee, unclear law does not make for good law. To make it fair for all, and to ensure public safety, the committee has recommended the introduction of a permit system for protest structures on national land. This is not an attempt to restrict protesters who want to use structures as part of their protest. The system we have proposed clarifies and simplifies the process by which protest structures can be authorised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other committee recommendations include identifying a contact officer in the Australian Federal Police to coordinate protests on national land and to liaise with protesters and other relevant authorities on the arrangements for protests; producing a public information booklet with advice about protesting on national land; repealing outdated and unnecessary legislation limiting protests; and revising existing laws applying to protests to ensure that they are written in plain English and outline clearly the powers available to relevant authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I finish by saying that, while bad demonstrations, as we witnessed in front of the parliament last year, are few and far between, it is through these bad experiences that the absolute and cherished right to protest may well be etched away. So it is incumbent on all demonstrators to keep this in mind when taking up the banner and marching. The committee is very grateful for the work and
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5965"> support provided by its secretariat. I commend the report to the parliament.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I would like  thank the committee secretariat for the fine work that has been carried out in this report. The secretariat is burdened with a very large workload, but it has indeed managed to carry out a very professional approach to the work at hand. Also, I would like to thank my parliamentary colleagues for the constructive work that they undertook in dealing with the report. It was a very constructive committee process, in my view and experience. Also, thanks to the committee chair, Senator McGauran, the deputy chair, Senator Lundy, and my Labor colleagues. Also, I would like to particularly thank the member for Hinkler (Mr Neville), who took a very constructive approach to the committee's deliberations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee has gone for a minimalist approach and we have done so for a number of reasons. Essentially, a crackdown, as sought by some small minority entities, would be impractical according to the evidence that the committee heard. We looked at experiences in the United States, where a whole raft of regulations imposed for demonstrations on national land were essentially regularly ignored, consequently making the conduct of demonstrations problematic indeed. Instead, we are seeking to facilitate peaceful demonstrations by enabling things like public address systems and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have attached an addendum, in my name, to the report. The addendum goes to the question of the Aboriginal tent embassy. Whilst the majority of the committee felt that it was unnecessary to comment on any one particular protest, there is a particular protest on national land, which is the tent embassy, the continued presence of which, in my view, should not be interfered with. The report does not recommend the removal of the Aboriginal tent embassy. The report does suggest the abolition of things like the Unlawful Assemblies Ordinance 1937 and other restrictive instruments which are designed to restrict demonstrations on national land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee proposes that some discretion be provided to the NCA over the ques
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tion of fixed structures&mdash;the NCA being the National Capital Authority, not the National Crime Authority. If such discretion is provided, the NCA should not interpret the recommendations of this committee as encouraging the removal of the tent embassy. Quite the contrary view should be taken, as the committee has actively considered and rejected proposals aimed at limiting the rights of protesters and has instead opted for minimalist intervention.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8H4">Mr HAWKER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the first report of the committee in this new parliament and I am pleased to say that the committee reached unanimous conclusions and recommendations. Competition policy is a critical area of reform for the public sector. This policy is about ensuring that, where public ownership exists, competition should apply.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The inquiry spanned two parliaments, and our report comes two years after the signing
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5966"> of the COAG agreement on the reforms by the Commonwealth and all state and territory governments. That agreement represents a major step forward in intergovernmental relations, as well as bringing the potential for large and lasting economic benefits to the Australian community. The significant benefits arising from competition reform have been recognised by all levels of government and all major political parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The expected benefits for ordinary Australians are price reductions, lower inflation, more growth, more jobs and uniform protection of consumer and business rights across the whole country. More specifically, the Industry Commission has estimated that the long&hyphen;run annual gain in real gross domestic product is of the order of 5.5 per cent, or $23 billion a year, as a result of the cumulative effect of the Hilmer and related reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this report, the committee focuses on making a constructive contribution to the debate on how the policy is being implemented. It has not sought to redefine the policy and it is too early for the committee to conduct a detailed evaluation of outcomes. Nor have we looked at the specific impact of the reforms in particular sectors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After two years of implementation, the reform policies of most jurisdictions are now firmly in place. Overall, the committee was impressed by the amount of effort parties have put into meeting their obligations under the competition principles agreement. The committee also notes the progress that has been made to date. Much, of course, remains to be done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this report the committee has addressed three crucial aspects of implementing the reforms: first, the public interest test, which is a pivotal element of the policy. The committee has outlined its interpretation of the test and it believes there should be some consistency of approach throughout jurisdictions. Accordingly, it has outlined what it sees are the basic principles that should guide the application of the test in all jurisdictions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Second, community service obligations which are an integral part of the system of all levels of government in this country. Competition policy has reinforced and encouraged a
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> greater awareness and systematic evaluation of CSOs. In the committee's view, the delivery and funding of CSOs should be assessed on a case by case basis. Attention should more strongly focus on their ongoing transparency and relevance, with appropriate reporting and monitoring systems for CSOs being implemented. Thirdly, at the commencement of the inquiry in mid-1995, local government held significant concerns about the reforms. Whilst many of these have been allayed, some remain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An area of critical concern to local government is the taxation of local government businesses. The committee shares that concern. We have recommended that the Treasurer (Mr Costello) address that issue as a matter of priority in COAG, as, under the current regime, there is a powerful incentive for local government not to corporatise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee has also addressed concerns about the application of the reforms to local government in rural and remote localities and has put forward suggestions to meet these. Shortly the Treasurer will be making his assessment of how the state and territory governments have met their obligations under the agreements and he will be determining the funds they will receive as their share in the benefits arising from implementing the reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Significant funds are at stake. Total national competition policy payments to state and local government over the next nine years will be $16.1 billion. Of that amount, competition payments account for $215.1 million in 1997-98. Payments are conditional on the state and territory governments meeting certain targets in implementation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To encourage transparency, the committee has recommended that the Treasurer ensure that the assessment is performance based and that he make details of the outcomes and process publicly available following assessment of each tranche. Local government's quest to share in the competition payments, as well as the financial assistance grants, is a matter for each state and territory government to decide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee has also recommended that COAG look at the more general issue of the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5967"> dual role of the National Competition Council of both advising on implementation and assessing implementation of the reforms. Given the scope of the reforms, their potential to substantially impact on the lives of all Australians, and the relative newness of the policy, it is critical that there is adequate public education and consultation about the reforms and their progress. The committee has recommended such public education arrangements be put in place early by all agencies involved in implementing the reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many people to be thanked for their hard work on the inquiry and report, in particular: the members of the committee and its predecessor; the Commonwealth and all state and territory governments for their cooperation and contributions; the many industry, local government and community organisations and individuals who provided evidence; our adviser in both parliaments, Jim Dick; and all the secretariat staff, particularly Chris Paterson and Bev Forbes, who worked on the inquiry in both this parliament and the last. I commend the report to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to commence by enlightening the House of the fact that the secretariat of the Standing Committee on Financial Institutions and Public Administration was a most professional body and that committee members conducted themselves in a most august and professional manner. The member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) detailed the fact that the report states, at paragraph 5.20, that from 1997&hyphen;98 to 2005&hyphen;2006 national competition policy payments, incorporating both financial assistance grants and competition payments, will total some $16.1 billion. It is on this point and this point only that a dissenting report has been issued going specifically to the matter in paragraph 5.20.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The national competition policy implementation agreement specifies that benefits to state and local government arising from competition reforms will be achieved by implementing the real per capita guarantee of financial assistance grants on a rolling three&hyphen;year basis and also through three instalments of general purpose payments in the form of a
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> series of competition payments. These are essentially the two legs from which local and state governments may benefit by participation in these reforms. The only reference to local government in the agreement is specifically to financial assistance grants pools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The agreement also states that local government will benefit from the link between state and local government financial assistance grants pools which make up some 70 per cent of the package agreed to by COAG. Members of the opposition dissented to paragraph 5.20 of the committee's report, which states, in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The total National Competition Policy Payments to state and local government from 1997&hyphen;98 to 2005&hyphen;2006 will be $16.1 billion (or $12.5 billion in 1994&hyphen;95 prices). FAGs will account for $10.8 billion and Competition Payments $5.3 billion.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Opposition members of the committee dissent because these amounts are not the amounts which state and local government will receive and it is absolute fiction to suggest that they are. It is fiction because the coalition government has required the states to make fiscal contributions to the Commonwealth of $1,559 million over three years&mdash;1996&hyphen;97 through to 1998&hyphen;99&mdash;the net effect of which is to reduce the Commonwealth's national competition payments by that amount. The upshot of this is that $14.6 billion is the most that the states and local government may receive from NCP payments. So even if these two levels of government both bend over backwards to implement competition policy, they will stand to gain only $14.6 billion, not $16.1 billion as detailed in the report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I alluded to the two legs of competition payments, that is, financial assistance incentives to the states. The first of those is that provision of financial assistance by the Commonwealth be conditional on the states making satisfactory progress in the area of reforming limitation and the second is straight out competition policy payments. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the parliamentary Standing Committee on Financial Institutions and Public Administration, I present the committee's report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Review of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission 1995&hyphen;96 annual report</EMPHASIS> , together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ordered that the report be printed.</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8H4">Mr HAWKER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The committee decided to examine the ACCC's annual report following concerns raised about the processes and procedures used by the ACCC in relation to mergers and section 87B undertakings. We took the opportunity to raise and discuss a number of issues with the ACCC at a public hearing in April this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ACCC, during the first year of its operation, has been at the forefront of major and, at times, controversial decisions affecting Australian business and industry. Also, the newly formed ACCC has a vital role in competition reforms being implemented across all sectors of the Australian community. The intention of these competition reforms is to achieve fair competition in all markets throughout Australia, with uniform rules and rights for all consumers and businesses applying throughout the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is where the ACCC comes in. Its main role is that of competition regulator. Its job is to ensure that the laws, as embodied in the Trade Practices Act and designed to promote and preserve competition, are observed. In the case of mergers considered by the ACCC,
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> there are a number of options&mdash;and I will briefly outline one of these.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the merger is judged likely to be anti&hyphen;competitive, the ACCC notifies the parties of its view and the reasons for it. The parties can then offer to amend the proposal so that it overcomes the anti&hyphen;competitive concerns. This occurred, for example, in the Mobil&hyphen;Amgas merger where Mobil undertook to provide independents, wholesalers and retailers with access to terminal facilities. It is the ACCC's use of this undertakings process that has drawn criticism from some segments of business and industry. In particular, the question arises about public accountability and the transparency of these procedures. The concerns are:</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> that the Trade Practices Act provides the ACCC with unfettered power to make and impose enforceable undertakings; and</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> that this power is widely used by the ACCC to restructure industries, without any requirement that the process be open to public scrutiny or third party involvement.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Caltex&hyphen;Ampol merger is cited as an example of where the ACCC has shaped an industry into its preferred model&mdash;in that case, to reshape the petrol retailing market. The Australian Petroleum Agents &amp; Distributors Association has raised two further points about this:</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> that there are no statutory guidelines to limit the ACCC's discretion in accepting undertakings; and</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> that the Trade Practices Act provides no mechanism for making the ACCC accountable for its actions in the acceptance of undertakings.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Moreover, third parties are not required to be consulted, nor can third parties seek a review of undertakings. The committee, while seeing undertakings as a useful tool, does however question the extent to which the undertakings process is open to public scrutiny. The committee favours a more transparent approach than is currently the case. Thus, we are recommending, as a first step, that the ACCC investigate mechanisms whereby the process of accepting undertakings in merger cases can be made more transparent.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5969">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will be seeking a report from the ACCC on this matter later in the year when the committee reviews the ACCC's 1996&hyphen;97 annual report. If the committee continues to have concerns, it may seek a reference to conduct a more comprehensive inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee also raised with the ACCC: to what extent the benefits of competition, in particular, consumer benefits, are occurring in rural and regional Australia? It would appear that the benefits of competition, in particular consumer benefits, are not being realised as strongly in rural areas as in the city. In my electorate, and in the electorates of some of the members of the committee&mdash;and I see the member for Page (Mr Causley) in the chamber&mdash;petrol prices are an example of where this certainly appears to be the case. The committee plans to pursue the issue of competition and consumer benefits when it reviews the ACCC's 1996&hyphen;97 annual report later this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The pursuit of competition is not an end in itself, but is intended to contribute to the public good, to create more efficient markets, to improve the provision of goods and services and bring about lower prices. With these objectives it is crucial that government, business, industry and the general public can measure the extent to which these benefits are being realised and whether the approaches being undertaken are working.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee supports the role played by the ACCC, but it believes there would be some benefit in a more systematic review of the general impact of the ACCC's decisions in the mergers area on competition and benefits to the community. To this end, the committee is recommending that the ACCC give a higher priority to monitoring outcomes. We are also interested to explore what mechanisms might be set up for external review, and have recommendations to this effect in our report.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to thank everyone involved and commend this report to the House. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the absence of the hardworking member  for Groom (Mr Taylor), I have the honour of presenting this tabling speech. The report I have just tabled includes two chapters on treaties tabled on 18 March and 13 May 1997 together with a progress report of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the eighth report the committee has tabled since September of last year. The treaties considered in the first two chapters are routine, but mention should be made of the agreement with New Zealand about the joint accreditation system which we have with that country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This agreement deals with a body which was established to meet the demand for an accreditation system for providers of quality management systems and product certification services. The objective behind this accreditation system is the attainment of national and international recognition of Australian and New Zealand producers, auditors, consultants and trainers functioning within conformity assessment structures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We were concerned that the system does not include a formal review mechanism to evaluate the success of its efforts to enhance exports. We have therefore recommended that
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5970"> such a formal mechanism be established. Since beginning the inquiry into the desertification convention, we have held three public hearings and one inspection. Honourable members will perhaps recall that this convention has been the subject of some controversy, and that Australia has not yet ratified it. The government has not yet tabled the national interest analysis on this convention. We understand that further consultation is required with the states and territories and with other interested organisations before such an NIA can be finalised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that, in this situation, there is no alternative for us other than to keep the situation under review and to reopen the inquiry when and if an NIA becomes available. I would also like to mention another matter briefly on behalf of the committee. In a recent speech, the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) referred to last year's reforms ensuring parliament had a `well&hyphen;defined and effective role' in the treaty making process. He was also kind enough to refer to the `proactive manner' in which this committee has carried out its role in the new process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our first report was tabled on 9 September 1996 and the government response was tabled on 14 May 1997. To date, the government has not responded to the remaining six reports, although we understand that two other responses will be tabled tomorrow. Nevertheless, the committee is disappointed at this relatively slow rate of response. In the absence of the member for Groom, lest I embarrass him if he was present, I must take this opportunity to commend the member for Groom for the tremendous work that he has done as chair of the committee and I commend other members of the committee likewise under his leadership. To date, just over a year since the committee was established, we have considered over 70 treaties. The committee itself has provided a valuable role in consultation with members of the public, government and non&hyphen;government organisations alike. Those treaties which we have considered have ranged from matters relating to the environment, trade, defence and to internal defence in terms of policing and law enforcement measures.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It performs a very valuable role in addressing these, consulting and education, as I have indicated and, in conclusion, again in his absence and at the risk of embarrassing him, I would like to commend the member for Groom for the tremendous hard work undertaken by him.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the person charged with the chairmanship of the subcommittee on the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, I thank the House for the opportunity to make this contribution. The desertification treaty is one of that list of treaties which have substantial impact, much wider than the simple intent of the convention. It was this type of treaty that originated in the Senate inquiry and, of course, the formation of this committee. Might I join with the member for Barton (Mr McClelland) in pointing out how well the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties works and the degree of cooperation between people of the various parties. We all totally support the current situation where the parliament now has a substantial involvement in the implementation of these treaties, compared to the circumstances of the past, where the Crown was defined as the maker of treaties in our constitution and the Crown was perceived to be the executive council. In other words, and I think quite frequently, not even the cabinet of the day saw these particular treaties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Treaties come in two categories&mdash;desertification, rights of the child, racial discrimination et cetera, which one can see as ground breaking areas&mdash;and the rest make up the more mundane aspect, with treaties on double taxation and airline agreements and all those things which are very important and where the committee is finding that there is an opportunity to make a contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My particular reason in rising is that, very early in the piece, most committee members had a grave concern that this desertification treaty, dealing as it would with land management throughout Australia, would open up another Commonwealth power and one that, whilst the government of the day might not want to use it, could be forced upon it by other interest groups literally taking the government to court and demanding that it
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5971"> meet its obligations, having promised the world that it would address desertification both at home and abroad.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This problem is aggravated by the fact that the treaty as written does not allow for reservations. In other words, there is no basic opportunity for a federal clause&mdash;because land management in Australia is very much a federal matter and the responsibility of state governments under our constitution&mdash;to address this problem.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consequently, the committee quite properly decided that we should not only advertise our intention to have an inquiry but also invite state governments in particular to make submissions. I wish to put on the record that only one state, New South Wales, has bothered to respond to our invitation. Whilst the committee received something like 28 submissions, which is a surprisingly low number on such a sensitive issue, the realities are that state governments&mdash;which have campaigned vigorously over the years to have a more expanded role in the treaty making process&mdash;when invited to make contributions on an area which has a direct effect on them have failed to do so. I hope some of them bother to read these words; I am not going to hold my breath.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other aspect of all this is that, whilst we have had some legal advice that says that particular action may not occur, personally I cannot see how it would not occur once the Commonwealth has made the promise. As I point out, by European standards I represent about 12,000 desert farmers. Outside me, in areas such as Kalgoorlie and western New South Wales, we also have our pastoral properties.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;`We shared the unspeakable grandeur of it all.' I am referring to Antarctica and I am quoting an Antarctic expeditioner, Syd Kirkby. I will come back to him in a little while. The point I want to make is that 1997 is the 50th anniversary, the jubilee, of Australia establishing permanent bases in Antarctica. Of course, in 1947 Dr Phillip Law and a band of intrepid expeditioners established our first base on Heard Island. We now have permanent bases on Macquarie Island and at Davis, Casey and Mawson on the Antarctic mainland which have been there for decades.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While this motion is dedicated to the science of Antarctica, I want to expand it beyond that because of the fact that we are celebrating 50 years of incredible Australian  endeavour in Antarctica. I want to not only take in the expeditioners we have now but those amazing men like Sir Douglas Mawson and the incredible photographer of Antarctica, Frank Hurley.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not just the scientists; there are the cooks and the plumbers; the carpenters and the doctors; the diesos&mdash;the diesel mechanics that keep the machinery and the bulldozers running; and the weather people&mdash;all of whom at this moment are involved in 24&hyphen;hour darkness in incredible isolation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to pay tribute to the families of those expeditioners who over the decades have been at home here in Australia while their husbands and, in some cases in recent
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5972"> years, their wives have been there for a year or 18 months in total isolation. After all, the last ship has to leave by 16 March or it does not leave at all, and the next ship cannot get back in until mid to late October. Those people in the ultimate wilderness are doing a wonderful job for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to mention the ships' crews, and in particular I want to make mention of the 17 expeditioners and three members of ships' crews who gave their lives in the service of Australia in Antarctica. It is a beautiful place&mdash;I know; I have been there twice&mdash;but a very demanding and very dangerous place. It is a place that, once seen, gets into your blood.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are four great lessons for the world from Antarctica. One is that there has never been a war there. It is the only continent where there has never been a war. Apart from one Russian going mad and killing one of his colleagues, there has never been a major crime. There has never been a shot fired in anger. All scientific information and knowledge is shared freely between all nations. The wildlife are not afraid of you. Totally wild animals have no fear of you as a human being.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I spoke of isolation. In 1963 at Davis Station there were only nine people; a total community of nine. Des Lugg told me at the Antarctic jubilee dinner on Saturday in Hobart, attended by 400 people and chaired by Tim Bowden, of the devastating impact it had when they learnt that one of their colleagues at Mawson, Bob White, had died at the age of 21. That same year, 1963, when they learnt of the assassination of President Kennedy, the impact on those nine Australians living in total isolation was enormous. I do not have time to speak on that at greater length.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mentioned Sydney Kirkby. He was a surveyor who led parties through the Prince Charles Mountains. I want to quote briefly from an article he has written for <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Aurora</EMPHASIS>, the magazine of the ANARE club. He wrote:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have great pleasure in being able to support the motion on Antarctic scientific programs moved by the member for Cowper (Mr Nehl). Antarctica is a special place which has a special magic. It has a stunning diversity of wildlife. It is a place of extraordinary beauty and splendour. It is vast. It is dangerous. It is a place of extremes. And it tells us something about our own limitations in an era when we are inclined to regard ourselves as supreme and to think that we, the human race, can do whatever we like.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have this opportunity to pay tribute to some 50 years of official Australian endeavour in Antarctica and to reflect on some of the important steps that we have taken and the important role that Australia has played in the protection of Antarctica. In particular, it is worth taking the House back to August 1989 when the then Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, and his French counterpart, Michel Rocard, took the lead in preventing mining and oil drilling in Antarctica, seeking to turn this magnificent, fragile, irreplaceable wilderness into an internationally protected reserve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At that time, there were strong arguments that it was possible to reconcile mining and oil drilling in Antarctica with environmental protection and that controls offered more realistic protection than an outright ban. But the very clear judgment was made by the Australian government at that time that it was simply not possible to have mining or oil drilling in an environment such as Antarctica's without the risk of extensive environmental damage of the kind of, or even worse than that which occurred with, the Exxon Valdez spill off the cost of Alaska in 1989.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5973">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the time, people were saying that this was an environmentally risky step. They said, `If the federal government is not able to achieve the Antarctic wilderness park, then we will not have any regulation or controls whatsoever.' In the couple of years following that, the Australian and, indeed, French governments were able to persuade the nations of the world and, in 1991, they ultimately adopted the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, which has banned mining and oil drilling in the Antarctic for at least the next 50 years and, hopefully, in perpetuity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The environment movement&mdash;groups such as the Australian Conservation Foundation, the Worldwide Fund for Nature and Greenpeace and the like&mdash;encouraged and supported the Australian government through that diplomatic journey in negotiating that protocol. That is something that I believe we can all be proud of. Certainly, it had the support of all parties in the federal parliament as well as support from the wider community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In recent times there have been continuing efforts to protect Antarctica. For example, we have had announcements that the subantarctic islands of Heard, McDonald and Macquarie islands are to be fast-tracked for world heritage listing. That is a most important step. Heard and McDonald islands have been described as having superlative phenomena, features and processes. Macquarie Island is some 1,500 kilometres south of Tasmania&mdash;indeed, I think it is represented by the member for Franklin (Mr Quick)&mdash;and is nicknamed `the great green sponge' because its sodden, densely vegetated landscape is regarded as one of the world's best examples of oceanic crust which has risen to the surface.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This island contains extraordinary wildlife.

<PARA STYLE="Para">Before I turn to the detail of the motion, I would like to make one thing clear at the start&mdash;that is, this debate is not an attack on immunisation. The Labor Party offered bipartisan support to the federal government's plans to seek to increase the level of immunisation in the Australian community, and we continue to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the record, let me remind the House of a statement on immunisation made by Aus
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5974"> tralian of the Year, Professor Peter Doherty, who has also received a Nobel prize. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">From the scientific point of view you just don't want to see kids getting sick and dying from completely preventable diseases, or becoming deaf from measles, or getting infections that are completely controllable.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He went on to say that there were no 100 per cent guarantees about the practice but the benefits of immunisation and vaccination far outweigh the risks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Peter Doherty has the knowledge to be able to put those statements on the public record. They are statements that the Labor Party opposition strongly support. Any risk from immunisation is infinitesimally smaller than the benefits that flow to the children who are fully immunised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this is about is government agencies which have carried out trials or experiments without parents or guardians being properly informed, or without parents or guardians giving their consent, and whether such activities are worthy of an open, public investigation. It is also about whether government agencies have carried out trials or experiments without the interests of children being protected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some people have said that worthy organisations such as the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories and some of the medical research institutes that were involved in these trials do not deserve to have their reputations damaged by a public inquiry. These organisations do have a good reputation in the Australian community, which is well deserved. But the point I would make is that I do not think that we would be doing the right thing by those organisations if we try to argue that they are to be immune, or protected, from proper public discussion and proper public examination of any mistakes that have been made in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What are the issues that we are concerned about? Perhaps I could begin with a few quotes from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>, which has been doing an excellent job in trying to get to the bottom of a number of concerns about the treatment of young children in institutions in Victoria. One article, in the Insight section, is headlined `Babies used in experiments', with the sub

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the largest experiment, which was still running in 1970, 350 infants between the ages of three months and 36 months in unnamed institutions were injected with full adult doses of trial influenza vaccines to test for toxic reactions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Researchers from the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories admitted at the time that they approached the test with "some trepidation" because influenza vaccines had "long been known to produce more severe toxic reactions in children than in adults".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>  has learnt that two previous tests of influenza vaccines on children produced severe toxic reactions. It is believed that the results of the tests were never published.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There are a whole series of cases that were published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>  that explain in more detail the concerns in the particular cases. Last week, we had another article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>  under the headline `Death sparks new fears on vaccine tests'. That article states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The State and Federal Governments will investigate circumstances surrounding the death of a child referred to at an international conference by a Commonwealth Serum Laboratories vaccine researcher.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The London conference proceedings show the researcher was questioned about the death, to which he did not refer in his main paper.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The article goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">When asked about the findings of the autopsy on the dead child, the researcher replied: "That actually was the work of another colleague of mine and I do not know whether I can comment on it."</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5975"> trepidation" because of the toxic reactions in some infants to existing vaccines.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In addition to the crucial question, which is whether or not children suffered in the trials, there is a second issue, that  is, whether there was proper consent given for this medical research. One of the doctors involved in the trials appeared on radio recently. I will not name the doctor, but I will read an excerpt from an interview on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Radio National</EMPHASIS> . It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">REPORTER: Who made that choice?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DOCTOR: I don't honestly know. Well, when I way I don't honestly know, it was presumably by arrangement with Stan Williams or the CSL.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">REPORTER: And do you know whether they got consent?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DOCTOR: Well, they'd have to. They'd have to have consent. But who they got it from, I don't know.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">REPORTER: Were you aware of that at the time?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DOCTOR: Of what?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">REPORTER: Of who gave the consent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DOCTOR: I didn't inquire. I presume&mdash;&hyphen; I mean, you went to a babies home, and the nursing staff or the matron or someone expected you. So, I didn't query any more . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Our concern is that it appears that there are questions remaining as to whether proper consent was given by the guardians of these children. The response of the Victorian state government through the Minister for Youth and Community Services, Dr Napthine, has been to initiate an internal departmental inquiry. Premier Kennett has rejected a public inquiry and the federal Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) made this comment in a radio interview:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">REPORTER: Isn't it time for the establishment of an independent national inquiry?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">WOOLDRIDGE: Well, it's not essentially a Commonwealth issue. The care of children is the responsibility of the states. If the Victorian government wishes to set up such an inquiry, I would be happy to cooperate with it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But I can't see what good would come out of a Commonwealth inquiry at this time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">My concern is that this is an issue that involves Commonwealth agencies. Commonwealth Serum Laboratories were involved, the National Health and Medical Research Council approved grants for the organisations involved in the trials and the federal depart
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment of health was responsible for the medical research policy at that time. So three Commonwealth organisations were involved, and for that reason alone the revelations to date justify some form of external investigation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The message the House can send to Minister Wooldridge and the message the House can send everyone in government is that  governments should not be able to do things to people without making sure that people are properly informed and give proper consent for trials such as this. For that reason, the Labor Party strongly supports some form of an open, public, independent examination of these issues. We want to make sure that it is thoroughly examined, not ignored. We want to make sure that it is independent, not some tame&hyphen;cat departmental review. We also want to make sure that it is open, not carried out behind closed doors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The worst possible thing that can happen is for these serious allegations to be investigated by the people who might be at risk of an adverse finding. It would also be highly undesirable if the Victorian and the federal departments of health and community services were to carry out some cursory and inadequate examination of these issues and to produce some departmental report that gets placed in a pigeon hole and gathers dust for years to come. An open and independent inquiry can make sure that everyone can find out what actually happened. It can protect the medical records of individuals concerned. We can try to make sure that these issues are exposed to the light of day and we can find out what actually went on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To those people such as Jeff Kennett who say, `This happened more than 40 years ago and is not worthy of proper investigation,' I say that these tests were going on as late as 1970. These tests raise very serious issues that should be investigated by an independent and open inquiry. That is what the federal opposition will continue to seek from Dr Wooldridge.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The clinical trials undertaken in postwar Melbourne on infants and children seem shocking by today's standards. The issues raised are complex and it is important to separate the distress of former wards of the state from whether any harm was done and whether the Commonwealth or state laws were complied with at the time. There are some problems in investigating this issue. The length of time that has expired, the fact that some of the people conducting the research are now deceased and the lack of documentation given on things like the consent procedures mean that we have to now rely on oral evidence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I do not believe that what is required is for the government to establish an independent inquiry. The Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) has already asked for a report from the Department of Health which should be available this week. Preliminary analysis of the case studies in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> suggests that the studies were conducted carefully with no significant injury to the study participants, although there is that case that was mentioned at an international conference in 1972 and I will get on to that later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is wrong to ascribe the standards of 1990s to research carried out in an earlier time. Vaccination is, after all, the result of an experiment. If we thought today how we would judge the inoculation of an 8 year&hyphen;old child with a potentially fatal injection, we would say that that was unacceptable. But yet, without that injection back in the 18th century, we would never have seen the eradication of smallpox. After all, it was Edward Jenner who made the observation that milkmaids were not infected by smallpox: he decided to give an injection, firstly of cowpox, to an 8 year&hyphen;old boy and then later to inject him with smallpox, an infection that was usually fatal. In 1796 he performed the first vaccination intentionally inoculating an 8 year&hyphen;old boy, James Phipps, with material from the cowpox lesions of a dairymaid, Sarah Nelmes. When he variolated Phipps on 1 July&mdash;that is giving him the smallpox&mdash;he had no response at all.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for Dobell raises an interesting point, because I cannot recall whether he did seek consent from the parents. He certainly did not go to an ethics committee and it is very unlikely that he would have been able to have obtained anything like informed consent, given that that was the first procedure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Thinking about smallpox, it is interesting to remember that smallpox is an example of the successful eradication of an infectious disease. The last case outside a laboratory was in Somalia in 1977 and, tragically, the last couple of people to die of smallpox were people who were accidentally exposed to laboratory specimens. The World Health Organisation actually announced the eradication of smallpox from the world in 1980. When I was studying paediatrics in the late 1980s, the bible of paediatrics had actually eliminated the entry for smallpox. They just had, `Smallpox, see previous editions.' It was thought that there was no need to know the clinical features of smallpox.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To say that we should not ascribe the standards of the 1950s to the 1990s is not to condone earlier practices which were unacceptable at that time. In looking at the trials in post-war Melbourne, you cannot compare them with some of notorious trials that we have read about recently in medical history. Recently President Clinton gave an apology to African Americans who were infected with syphilis to observe its clinical effects. That is an horrific example of a trial that is unacceptable and inhumane, given that, at the time, there were simple treatments available for syphilis. Other examples include children with Down Syndrome who were infected with hepatitis, the exposure of service personnel to radiation or the withholding of treatment in clinical studies for people with things like cervical cancer and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you look at the time, it was possible for people to have better treatment. It was possible for these things to be done better. Looking at trials of vaccines and drugs, they are a lot more difficult to judge. It was a different era, when you think back. People
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5977"> like Alan Marshall could write about their experiences of childhood polio. The longest serving US president was someone who was also afflicted by childhood polio. How many statesmen and authors today have been struck down by those childhood diseases? None. School sporting events were being cancelled in the 1940s and early 1950s due to polio epidemics. Children were still dying of things like diphtheria and whooping cough. In my time working in paediatrics I only ever saw one case of whooping cough, which had come from Ernabella, one of Aboriginal communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Children were being born to mothers who were infected by rubella in their first term. Children were born with problems like mental retardation, cataracts and deafness. It is not widely known that it was an Australian ophthalmologist who drew the connection&mdash;that it was congenital rubella that these infants were contracting that actually led to that syndrome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you think back to the 1950s, there were some landmark improvements and advances. Firstly there was the development by Salk of the first polio vaccine, which was in an injectable form, and three or four years' later there was the development by Sabine of the oral polio vaccine. We owe a lot to those pioneering researchers who gave us safe and accessible vaccines today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The studies that were carried out in Melbourne were not secret. They were published in academic journals at the time. As the chairman of the National Health and Medical Research Council, Richard Larkins, has said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no evidence that the procedures were improper. It appears that the legal guardians of the children gave their consent, although the concept of 1950s informed consent is different to what it is today.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Unfortunately, there is no explicit detail in the research on how the informed consent was obtained. I will quote from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS>  of 24 June 1997 which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Walter and Eliza Hall spokesman David Vaux insists vaccine trials conducted by the institute were not experiments, but potentially lifesaving treatments. `At the time, consent was given by the sisters in charge who brought
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in medical professionals because children at the orphanages were dying,' he argues. `In the `50s, people were more terrified of these infectious diseases than we are today of AIDS.'</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There is no evidence that anyone was harmed or that any state or Commonwealth laws were breached. While it is a sad indictment of the era that many of the children were from orphanages, there were other children who were also involved in the trials&mdash;presumably with the consent of their parents.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to take this opportunity of condemning the action of the opposition parties in the Senate in rejecting the government's bill to facilitate a voluntary postal vote for the People's Convention. Prior to the last election we decided that we would give the Australian people the form of government they want, rather than seek to impose a form of government upon them in the way that the former government sought to do. We believe that it is inappropriate that there should be a compulsory ballot for election of the delegates to the People's Convention because the convention itself will not decide whether Australia is going to be a republic, and any proposals brought forward at the People's Convention would have to be put to the people at a referendum. The vote at such a referendum would be a compulsory ballot.</PARA></TALK.START>

The signing will conclude the contract negotiation phase and will provide for 33 Hawk aircraft under unique arrangements, which include a support package and Australian industry involvement for in-country support for the aircraft and the systems over the whole 25-year life of the aircraft.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Total value of the contract is around $850 million. But there is a new contractual approach requiring tenderers to assess the number of aircraft to meet the RAAF's training needs and to develop a support package and an Australian industry program. The final contract guarantees the provision of logistic and maintenance support for 75 months, with renewal options throughout the whole 25-year life of the aircraft as well as through&hyphen;life maintenance guarantee for the Rolls-Royce Adour engine.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5983">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is important about this unique contract is that it provides known cost and guaranteed aircraft availability for a pre-determined number of aircraft on line daily throughout the life of the contract. There will be, of course, very obviously significant benefits to the Hunter and other regions. The work in Australia related to the contract is now up to 35 per cent of the total contract&mdash;up from the 27 per cent announced in November, which should interest the member for Brisbane, when I announced the preferred tenderer. In the maintenance and support phase of the contract, there is a target of just under 80 per cent for Australian industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A major new facility will be built on leased land at Newcastle. That will be to assemble 21 of the 33 aircraft and to provide ongoing maintenance. Some 150 jobs will be created in constructing those facilities and between 80 and 100 jobs ongoing in aircraft assembly. In fact $60 million will be expended in the Newcastle region directly during construction and in the seven-year support phase. More than $400 million will be spent on maintenance support in Australia from 2007 until 2025. Other states&mdash;obviously SA, Victoria and Western Australia&mdash;will gain additional jobs throughout the contract.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a flow on, and importantly, British Aerospace Australia, Qantas and Hawker de Havilland will be able to expect to competitively bid for support and maintenance of aircraft to be supplied to other Hawk operators in the Asia-Pacific. The contract will be signed tomorrow. It represents a new and advanced approach to defence acquisition and support. It brings with it very substantial benefits to the ADF, to the Hunter and to other regions of Australia which will benefit directly from the construction, the assembly and the through&hyphen;life support and maintenance of this new lead-in fighter project.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK></QWN>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CT4">Mr COSTELLO</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I do not agree with the observations that were made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. I made it clear in the parliament last week and I make it clear again that the government is interested in broad based tax reform. What a broad based tax reform would obviously look at would be the indirect tax base and the income tax base. I made the point that a narrow indirect tax base means that, on those classes of goods within the net, the comparative taxation burden falls heavily and it is a declining base. I do not think there is any doubt about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also made the point that one of the corollaries of that is that, in relation to income tax, people in Australia are kicked into high marginal tax rates at low multiples of average weekly earnings. If you were going to design a better tax system, you would want a broader base in relation to indirect taxes and a broader base in relation to income taxes. The important point about that second observation I make is to ensure that everybody pays their fair share of income taxes. It is one of the reasons why our government ended R&amp;D syndication. The Labor Party knew very well what R&amp;D syndication was. It was available to rich people to minimise or walk away from their tax liabilities. Who stood with them? The Labor Party.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5985"> by broadening the base. Let us just think about this. The Labor Party should just think about this for a moment: one of the reasons why ordinary PAYE taxpayers have high marginal income tax rates is that you wanted to make it optional for high income earners to pay income tax. It was optional under R&amp;D syndicates and it was optional under infrastructure borrowings. You had to be on $135,000 to get into infrastructure borrowings. If you were above $185,000 on superannuation, you reduced your marginal tax rate from 47 to 15. From 47, you could bring it down to 15&mdash;a 32 per cent tax reduction. What you do when you broaden the income tax base is you have the capacity to lower marginal tax rates. That is why we did it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Macquarie for his question on an obviously very important issue. Senator Hill is in New York at present to put Australia's position on the climate change negotiations. I am pleased to report that there has been
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> some progress that is positive to Australia's position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By way of background, Australia is very keen to play an active and constructive role in these negotiations on climate change as we search for a global solution to a very complex environmental problem. Our approach at the UN General Assembly meeting will be based on a need to deliver a response to climate change that is fair and equitable. We want to achieve this through a differentiation of developed country commitments which would ensure that international efforts to reduce emissions of greenhouse gasses result in similar economic impacts on countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other countries, however, have called for the adoption of legally binding emission reduction targets by developed countries. However, we have argued that it is premature to consider legally binding targets at a time when the level, time frame and costs associated with them are unknown. Over the last several days, in Denver, the Summit of Eight signifies that Australia is making encouraging progress in these negotiations. The Summit of Eight's communique refers to the new climate change agreement as needing to contain `meaningful, realistic and equitable targets', thus giving recognition to the key tenet of Australia's negotiating position, that is, the need for the equitable differentiation of country targets so that each country has a target that takes into account the economic realities of individual country's circumstances. This position of course is absolutely vital for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that the differentiation can deliver greater environmental effectiveness and equity. This is because the commitments that take into account national circumstances will be fairer, more realistic and, therefore, achievable. Greater achievability of commitments will strengthen the participation and contribution of countries to an effective environmental outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final decisions will be taken in Kyoto, in Japan, in December. There is still some time to go until we get to that position. The Prime Minister's own discussions, while he is talking with Prime Minister Blair and President Clinton, will focus on some of these
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5986"> issues. Senator Hill, in his departing remarks about the position and the views that he would be taking in these vital discussions, said:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Under the Income Tax Act, it is forbidden, by law, to disclose the affairs of any individual taxpayer, for obvious reasons. In relation to known techniques for multinational companies to reduce their tax, there are numbers, of which transfer pricing is probably one of the most prevalent. In relation to transfer pricing, at my initiative the APEC and OECD sponsored a joint forum in Sydney last year. We are pursuing, through the APEC forum, ways to improve anti-avoidance measures against transfer pricing. In relation to transfer pricing, you obviously need the cooperation of foreign countries as well as your own to get to the bottom of whether or not transfer pricing is occurring.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, in the budget of May of this year, I announced measures to considerably tighten the rules in relation to foreign source income, essentially to narrow the list of countries to the G7 that are on the list of comparable tax jurisdictions and other changes in relation to accruals taxation measures.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Parramatta for his question. I am quite sure he would have heard, as would many members of this House have heard over the weekend, the very wide support in his community for the youth allowance provisions which the government announced last week. The important thing about the youth allowance is that it sends the right message to young people. Up until now, the system which has been supported by the Labor Party has given young people a very damaging message: that it is all right to be trying to live on the dole and not preparing for their future through extended education and training. The youth allowance gets those incentives right.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Leader of the Opposition, I notice, has made some very bold statements about the youth allowance. We may as well have them on the record. It was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS> on Friday that the Labor Party would throw the youth allowance out lock, stock, and barrel. He said that there were some issues on which it was `too important to
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5987"> compromise.' Then later on he went on to say, `This looks like something that we just reject outright.' This shows again exactly how out of touch the Labor Party is with the basic values of the Australian community. The Leader of the Opposition has a very short memory because, of course, we remember his statements to this House that the Labor Party would introduce a whole raft of amendments to the work for the dole legislation which they opposed and did not like.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that the Leader of the Opposition is not the person who decides this in the Labor Party in the end. It is Senator Faulkner and Senator Sherry and, when it came to the crunch in the Senate this afternoon, that whole raft of amendments just disappeared because the senators were not prepared to go along with the views put by the Leader of the Opposition here in the House. Do we take your comments on the youth allowance as having exactly the same level of credibility?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Parramatta raised the question of statements that the government is planning to reduce funding for schooling. As we move down the front bench, the policy fog thickens because we remember the member for Werriwa telling this House that the government's policies were designed to take students out of government schools and put them into non&hyphen;government schools, but the member for Werriwa has now completely reversed this position and says that the government must put extra money into schools to prepare `for the inevitable blow&hyphen;out in student numbers in government schools.' We are seeing the utter confusion on the Labor Party side of the House about the consequences of the government's policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Werriwa continues to go around the country telling people that the government is cutting funding to government schools. He has even used a sum of $270 million, which I think he got for Senator Allison. I challenge him to tell us where that figure comes from because it is not a figure which the government has provided in any context whatever.</PARA>

Over the next four years, government schools will be gaining an extra $2.3 billion above what they would have received had we maintained the Labor Party's level of funding in its last year of government.

The introduction of the family tax initiative was an introduction of the government's tax commitment before the last election on time, in full, on budget on 1 January 1997. As far as the coalition government is concerned, it took great pleasure in being able to deliver from 1 January 1997  benefits to two million Australian families&mdash;two million Australian families benefited under the coalition's family tax initiative.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">About one million of those families that are low income families are able to access the family tax initiative through a payment made through the Department of Social Security. Most of those families have already been accessing that family benefit from 1 January 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For a family with at least one dependent child under five years of age who qualifies under the income means test&mdash;that is, their taxable income is less than $65,000&mdash;the benefits that are provided to them are: $19.20 for a family with at least one child under five years of age and going up to $34 per fortnight for a family with two children. These are direct benefits to families, which came into effect on 1 January 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I raise it for another reason. For the other one million who can claim it through the income tax system, a number of them will have already filed PAYE instalment reductions to be receiving it as a bonus in reduced tax from their payments from 1 January 1997. But it is important for those families who did not lodge the instalment deductions that, when they come to complete their income tax return for the end of the financial year on 30 June 1997, they fill in that area applying to family tax initiative. For all of those families that have not received the benefit through their income tax instalment deductions who file their tax returns after 30 June 1997 will receive large refunds on their tax as a result of this government's family tax initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The good news for nearly one million Australian families, those who have not already claimed it, is that they will be receiving, in relation to their tax returns, large income tax refunds if they have dependent
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> children and they qualify for the income test which, on average, starts at $70,000 per family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a government that can stand up to the Australian people and say that it is has now implemented or will shortly implement all of the income tax and tax undertakings that we made before the last election. We promised to reduce income taxes for families. It started on 1 January 1997. We promised small business capital gains tax rollover relief. It will start on 1 July. We promised to reduce the taxes on savings in this country and when we get that legislation through the parliament, if we can overcome Labor opposition, again in relation to tax reductions, that will be in place by 1 July of next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a government that took its tax commitments seriously; which delivered on budget, in full and on time. This is a government which deliberately made sure that it did not follow in the footsteps of the shameful Labor performance over the l&hyphen;a&hyphen;w tax cuts and, as a result, this government can say to the Australian people concerning those undertakings that we take back to them for the tax reform cause in the future that they know we have a track record of delivering in full, on time, on budget.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question relates to stress claims. The words `stress claims' do not appear in that legislation. We obviously considered this matter before the question was asked. The answer that I have for the House is to say that, in fact, we are dealing with the issue of stress claims by both administrative and other means. For example, with the administrative measures, we have a stress claims management centre operating. We also have a preventative program in place which is to deal with that issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To put this issue in context, occupational stress claims are generally high cost claims. While the number of accepted claims is dropping, the cost associated with those claims continues to rise. The average cost of a stress claim is $32,700 compared with $7,700 for other claims. In this financial year, stress claims have cost the Commonwealth $35.7 million. What I am concerned about is the fact that, over time, people have claimed compensation in circumstances where it is fair to say that the injury is not in fact work related. The previous scheme was not meant to compensate people for injuries which are not work related and particularly not for stress which arises out of legitimate human resource management action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think members of the House would be interested in some of the stress claims which have been successful against the Commonwealth recently. For example, an employee
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5991"> claimed stress as a result of a grievance process. The situation was that a colleague had lodged a grievance against this employee and the investigating officer found that the employee had acted improperly. The employee was not happy about the result and has not been at work since mid&hyphen;1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A second claim relates to a circumstance where certain public servants were moving office and they were in temporary accommodation. An employee claimed for stress as a result of what she perceived to be an inappropriate comment in the workplace. The comment was made to the whole work group, but the individual said she found it personally offensive. I am told the words from the manager were to the effect that, whilst it was inconvenient for people to be moved from permanent accommodation to temporary accommodation, given the circumstances people would simply have to go through the exercise and wait and see. Strangely enough, the individual only lodged her claim when she was interviewed in relation to poor performance. The cost of this claim is approximately $190,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lastly, for the bike riders in the House, this claim will attract their attention. An employee claimed that work related stress aggravated a pre&hyphen;existing knee injury. He underwent rehabilitation and was given modified duties. These duties required him to travel, so he claimed the cost of adding a sidecar to his motorbike to make it easier to ride. The cost to date in this claim, including the sidecar, is over $166,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are the general facts which have been provided to me by the relevant authority. These are the circumstances that we have inherited. We are dealing with the issue on an administrative as well as a preventative basis. What is interesting is that the Labor Party is opposed to the legislative changes necessary to fix up the mess which we inherited.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a government that has had the welfare of self&hyphen;funded retirees on its mind. It has put in place numbers of measures to help self&hyphen;funded retirees. Mr Speaker, you will be aware that this is the government that announced the savings rebate: a rebate of up to $450 for a 15 per cent reduction on the marginal income tax rate, up to a ceiling, which is available to all people in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You do not have to be in the work force to claim this, and you do not have to have your investments locked up in one narrow class such as superannuation. If you happen to be a self&hyphen;funded retiree, you are eligible for this savings rebate. You can have your money in the bank, you can have it in stocks, you can have it in a business&mdash;you can have your money where you choose, and get a 15 per cent reduction in your marginal income tax rate. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Who are the people who live predominantly on their investments in Australia: the self&hyphen;funded retiree, the person that is actually retired. This government was very pleased to be able to announce a savings rebate to help them. That still has to go through the parliament, and we know the Labor Party is opposed to it. The Labor Party is opposed to measures helping self&hyphen;funded retirees; the coalition is in favour of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In last year's budget we announced that the pensioner tax rebate would be extended to non&hyphen;pensioners. That meant that the way in which the taxation system worked against a self&hyphen;funded retiree was abolished by the announcement in last year's budget. What this means is that commencing with a half rebate this year, for 1996-97 income, and a full rebate next year<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">those self&hyphen;refunded retirees who earn incomes in the range of $11,545 to $21,377 will get the same taxation treatment as pensioners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prior to that announcement, if you happened to be a pensioner with a private income, you got a better tax deal than a self&hyphen;funded retiree on exactly the same income&mdash;for exactly the same income there were two rates of taxation. That was one of the changes that our government was able to put in place to help self&hyphen;funded retirees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 1 July this year, private health insurance incentives will come into play for self&hyphen;funded retirees. People who are taking out private health insurance&mdash;they had no assistance whatsoever from the government before&mdash;will get $125 for singles and $250 for couples. They will get help to take out private health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to underline one other thing for the people of Moreton. You quite often hear self&hyphen;funded retirees complaining about low interest rates. Interest rates are low at the moment because inflation is low. Nothing helps a self&hyphen;funded retiree more than low inflation. People do not realise that high inflation steals the value of your savings. Under an inflation rate of 10 per cent&mdash;which was quite common during the 1980s and 1990s&mdash;the real value of a fixed capital sum would erode, halve, in seven years. Under two per cent inflation, the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5993"> real value of a fixed capital sum erodes over 35 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What low inflation does is protect the value of the savings of those people who have saved and are living off their savings. Even though nominal interest rates are not high as a consequence&mdash;in fact, they are extremely low in Australia at the moment&mdash;if you happen to be a self&hyphen;funded retiree, the value is that your savings are not being whittled away by inflation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you put together the pensioner rebate, the savings rebate, the private health insurance initiatives and low inflation, that adds up to an unmistakable message from this government: we are committed to helping self&hyphen;funded retirees. We want to encourage people to say: savings are good for this country. Those people who have worked and have saved are not going to be forgotten by the coalition government.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

Would the minister also outline the government's position on the key issues of concern raised by the Australian Hellenic Council at its annual general meeting?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="5994" SPEAKER="Downer, Alexander, MP" NAMEID="4G4" ELECTORATE="Mayo" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Foreign Affairs" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4G4">Mr DOWNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Adelaide for her question. I begin by warmly congratulating the member for Adelaide on having just been awarded the Nike award for her outstanding contribution to the Greek community in Australia. I am aware that the Australian Hellenic Council held its annual meeting this weekend in Canberra, and I am looking forward to meeting with the council during this evening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Hellenic Council is an umbrella organisation that represents a broad spectrum of the Australian Hellenic community and it has made a very important contribution to multicultural Australia. The government attaches a high priority to our relations with Greece, and that is obviously a matter of great interest to the Australian Hellenic Council. We made an election commitment to
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5995"> strengthen our relationships with Europe, including our relations with Greece, and I expect to make a visit to Greece in the not too distant future. Let me also say that the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs will be visiting Greece, I think, in late July.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia's warm and friendly relationship with Greece is underpinned by strong community links. Greek migrants have played an enriching role in this country, in particular in its cultural life as well as its economic life, since World War II, and there are other deep and abiding links, not least those forged during World War II in the Greek campaign of April 1941 and the battle of Crete.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because of these close links, Australia has an enduring interest in seeing a lessening of tension in the regions surrounding Greece. We are heartened by the constructive relationship that has now begun to develop between Greece and the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia by Greece's commitment to negotiate a solution to the differences that exist between it and its neighbours. The government is sensitive to concerns of communities in Australia which originate from both countries and has instituted a consultation process to enable the views and concerns of those communities to be heard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say in conclusion that the government supports all efforts to achieve a peaceful and lasting solution in Cyprus. I very much hope that during this year we will see real and constructive progress on the issue of Cyprus. The government is keenly interested in the goal of a reunified Cyprus that is acceptable to both sides. I personally raised this issue with the United Nations Secretary&hyphen;General, with the Presidency of the European Union and the President of Cyprus, Mr Clerides, when I saw him in late January, early February this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Earlier this month I issued a press release welcoming the appointment of Richard Holbrooke as the US Special Presidential Emissary on Cyprus and called on all parties to seize any opportunities available to negotiate a just solution. I have reiterated that Australia stands ready to lend all possible assistance to facilitate a solution. I have no
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> allusions that this is going to be a very difficult matter to resolve. It is many years since the Turkish invasion of Cyprus. It is an issue on which the international community is going to have to work very hard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have just mentioned the appointment of the US Special Presidential Emissary on Cyprus, Dick Holbrooke. The United States administration this year has given a particular focus to the issue. I know the European Union is as well and, as I mentioned, I have spoken to the United Nations Secretary&hyphen;General about this matter and he has made it clear that one of his highest priorities is going to be the resolution of the problem in Cyprus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us hope that we can see some progress during this year. I welcome the Hellenic Council to Canberra and look forward to seeing the council continue to play the constructive role it currently plays.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That this House censures the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs for misleading the House on his conversation with Mr Greiner and his continuing breach of the Ministerial Code of Conduct.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What we are getting here today, as we got all last week, is a deliberate campaign by the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser) of obfuscation and of a clear&hyphen;cut breach of the ministerial code of conduct. That obfuscation, in which he has been invited by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to dance around the point in clear breach of that ministerial code of conduct, has finally descended to this. This House now has been misled. This is one step further than the propositions that we were dealing with last week. What we dealt with last week was a total failure by this government&mdash;a complete abdication of its responsibility to see its ministerial code of conduct upheld.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That code of conduct, which was there in existence when we were in office, which was there of course before we got into office and which has been a very longstanding code of conduct, has among other provisions within that code of conduct a clear requirement that there should be no business activities other than the business of the portfolio conducted by ministers when they held that portfolio&mdash;no business activities whatsoever; no ifs, no buts, no by your leave, no maybes, no perhapses, no in some circumstances&mdash;you will not while you happen to be a minister of this country conduct private business affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It becomes compounded further, because there are other provisions as well as that simple proposition, when what is added to
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that of course is the question of whether or not you maintain anything other than an arms&hyphen;length relationship with shareholdings and other activities. It is also taken a point further when there is a requirement upon a minister to ensure that, when he is in that arms&hyphen;length position, he does not in fact benefit from any decisions that may be taken by his portfolio even where he is not concerned with the day to day management of those business affairs. This minister is in manifest breach of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had that two&hyphen;faced Prime Minister of ours get up and effectively confirm that fact when, at the same time as he said there had been no breach of those standards, after 15 months he removed the minister from precisely the point of breach of those standards, that second layer of standards related to the fact that you should not only be just arms&hyphen;length; you should not benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course when the Prime Minister did that he confessed the failure of his minister. He confessed the fact that the minister had failed to properly uphold that particular standard and he made movement on that front. Apart from understanding or believing that he cannot afford another ministerial loss that casts doubt upon his own personal integrity, what the Prime Minister clearly did not understand was that there are other problems as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last week we then had the minister getting up on his scrapers in this place and saying, `While the Prime Minister has knocked me off very temporarily from questions relating to tenancy arrangements, I am still in charge of policy on franchising.' He was very proud of that fact when he got up and said, `I'm still in charge of policy on franchising.' Of course, then we find that very large numbers of those tenants of his, who pay him rents, restore his family fortunes and establish his family fortunes and his own personal fortunes, are in fact franchisees. A direct conflict of interest yet again and this time an uncorrected&mdash;albeit belatedly uncorrected&mdash;piece of conflict of interest by the Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All these faults are out there singing and dancing. All these skeletons are out of the cupboard. All of them have got their jawbones chattering across the stage of Australian politics as the skeletons run rife from this
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5997"> particular minister's background into the public domain. But what has not been out there singing and dancing yet from that chorus of skeletons of a set of propositions about honesty and integrity in this government has been the ultimate failure as far as this House is concerned&mdash;as opposed to simply matters of government propriety&mdash;that on matters related to your portfolio, in this case your personal interests associated with this portfolio, you have misled the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is more believable: your denial that you did anything other than ask for an exchange of addresses with Mr Greiner; or Mr Greiner's obvious commonsense statement that, when he was asked for an address, he asked you, `Why are you asking for the addresses of these coves; why are you asking for the addresses of these characters?' He did not think there was anything wrong in his saying that even though, having been a minister himself, he might have been alerted to some potential area of danger. He did not see in his own mind anything particularly wrong associated with that when he said that what you were interested in was a Target store in your Eaton shopping centre development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why would you be interested in a Target store? We will get to the misleading element of that. But let us just set on the record as to why you would be interested and why this is at the very heart of both your misleading of the parliament and your last weeks of self-confession of a conflict of interest&mdash;or prime ministerial self-confession of a conflict of interest.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If you can get a Target store, it is bankable; if you can place a Target store in your shopping centre, the entire other 20 or 30 stores in that shopping centre sing and dance around it. You can double the rents; you can put in your 10 per cent per annum escalated clauses; you can establish a profitable shopping centre, built at vast expense out of your personal fortune, for the people who are coming into your shopping centre; and you can ensure that you get a rate

There is your brother but he seems to be exclusively concerned with protecting your interests, 95 per cent of which constitute the ownership status of this particular shopping centre development.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You went to Greiner and you told Greiner that you wanted those addresses so that your brother could contact those people and put a Target store into your shopping centre. You come into this chamber trying to make light of the fact that the tenants in your already existing shopping centres find you a very close&hyphen;working general manager as far as their affairs are concerned; a decent man no doubt; a good man; and a hands-on man. They find you to be one who is concerned about their welfare, one who, every weekend he is home, looks after the daily affairs of their centres and who even cleans up their rubbish. They think you are a terrific fellow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what he is, in fact, as far as this parliament is concerned is not simply a terrific fellow. He is a person who has misled this parliament; he is a person who has breached ministerial standards; he is a person who is manifestly in breach of that requirement that you do not mix your private affairs with your ministerial portfolio and that you exit it if you do so. It is a tough requirement. There is no question about that. It is an extraordinarily tough requirement on somebody who has decent interests that he has built up for himself over the years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I know the honourable member slightly but many in Western Australia know him well. They know him as a person who has built up a considerable personal fortune. He has done that with, in some circumstances, relative decency shown to the people with whom he has treated. We know all that about him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know one other thing about him, and it is confirmed here time and time again. This is not a man who, having worked so hard to establish those things, establishes himself at a point distant from them. He is not a man who would do that. That 95 per cent ownership that he sustains in all of that is a real
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5998"> ownership. It is a managerial, hands-on ownership. It is an ownership that he cannot let go of because he rightly holds fears that, were he to do so, what goes out the window is his own personal fortune. It is not the sort of arms&hyphen;length relationship that you would establish with BHP shares or something else down the line where there is a whole managerial substratum out there managing the position that you happen to be in.</PARA>

We could have a great deal of sympathy with a man in those circumstances where he has worked so hard to build that fortune. But there are choices to be made in public life.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not as though these are not areas of controversy. This is at the very heart of the bitterness of the Australian small business community. The Australian small business
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> community&mdash;contrary to what the Treasurer (Mr Costello) might like to have us believe&mdash;does not spend its life thinking about the capital gains tax regime; it does not. It does not spend its life thinking about the fact that the government may have once promised to reduce 50 per cent of the red tape&mdash;and wondering how on earth you measure that; small business people do not spend their waking hours thinking of that either.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What small business thinks about is basically its relationship to big business; it thinks about its relationship to vertically integrated suppliers; it thinks about its relationship to the people who own the shopping centres; it thinks about its relationship to the franchisor when it happens to be a franchisee in what is the fastest growing area of small business in this community now&mdash;that is what small business thinks about. That is what small business is indeed obsessed with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why small business, even more vehemently than we in this chamber, has repeatedly been asking for the removal of this minister from handling their affairs, because small business understands that the minister cannot bifurcate his mind in the affairs that he administers in relation to them. They understand as they deal with this minister that this is a minister who has embedded in his consciousness&mdash;it is the position of the shopping centre owners vis-a-vis themselves&mdash;his view of the rights of the franchisors as opposed to the franchisees. He has this understanding from his deep personal day-to-day operations, and they do not trust him. They do not trust him as a result of that. They are up in arms and amazed that they cannot get the sympathy of a government that wraps itself in a small business flag every time it gets up on its scrapers in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They cannot understand that it is a government that sings the tune but does not seem to know the words. The tune for small business comes out, but the words that come out are all wrong because the words that come out have nothing to do with what the interests of small business actually are. The words that come out are front and centre words which are a bitter pill. When they think they are going to get a bit of justice for oppressive
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5999"> conduct, when they think they are going to get a bit of justice for the franchisees, what comes out is obfuscation and delay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When a reference is placed before the parliamentary committee and when the parliamentary committee picks up what everybody knows small business most wants, the minister comes out so fast off the blocks with: `Even though I said this was a matter of Commonwealth concern, it is not really; it is for the states. And even though I said you shall put forward a reference which relates to a code of conduct as far as tenancies are concerned I will not be pursuing that. I will not legislate.' That was his initial reaction. They know what he thinks and they know why he thinks it. They know that it is not a product of the disinterest of somebody standing at arms&hyphen;length from what is going on, but the interest of somebody who cannot help himself because his claws are right there in the middle of it, whether he likes it or not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately for this minister, he has not comprehended that in the extraordinarily difficult circumstances in which he finds himself he has a requirement here to be very careful in the way in which he answers questions. He has not been. What he has to do when he answers in this place defending the indefensible is not take his error a point further&mdash;not take his error to the point where he actively misleads this House. He has to be extraordinarily careful about this. He probably would have been better placed in terms of his own interests had he stood up in this place and said: `I know nothing, I see nothing, I do nothing, I answer no questions.' It would be better for him to get up in this place and refuse to answer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the minister has answered. The minister was being advised by the Treasurer, who may or may not have his best interests at heart, and the Leader of the House (Mr Reith), who may or may not have his best interests at heart. It must be said that when we saw his defence last week a question mark can been placed over whether or not he has the minister's best interests at heart. He was advised by them and by his bush lawyers that as far as this item is concerned what he ought to do is leave himself with enough ice to
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> skate on. But he did not. He said: `I have given full detail on this matter.' He has not given full detail on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Greiner is absolutely believable when he says, `He discussed with me.' It is not as though we have not given him an opportunity to rule it out, to deny it&mdash;to do whatever it is that he wants to do to get himself out of this. We have given him every opportunity. Three times he has come to this dispatch box&mdash;four times, if you count the answer that he gave last week&mdash;and he has obfuscated every time on a simple proposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why would he want to deny it? Why would he want to deny Mr Greiner's statement of the obvious? Because if he fails to deny Mr Greiner's statement of the obvious, any conceivable pretence that he is not a hands-on manager of his 95 per cent personally owned operation of three shopping centres is straight out the door. We think it is straight out the door for other reasons. We think it is straight out the door on the testimony of his tenants. We think it is straight out the door on the Prime Minister's two-faced action of denying it on the one hand and actually doing it on the other, effectively ripping it off him. We think that ought to be enough for right&hyphen;thinking people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We think that a commonsense prime minister should be prepared to shed somebody who, whilst a nice bloke, is not much chop as a minister under any set of circumstances. We think that this is an eminently jettisonable minister. We think that in those circumstances, where you had somebody who was a bit stronger than this Prime Minister&mdash;who is rapidly emerging as one of the weakest around this region and one of the weakest this country has had since Billy McMahon, with whom he competes&mdash;we would get from the Prime Minister a discarding of his minister, as there should be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We think that would have been sufficient. But it is not sufficient. We are obliged to build more on top of it. The problem for this minister is that he gives us more and more. It was not a matter simply left to his brother. It was not a matter simply left to the managers of his business apart from his brother. He told Mr Greiner, utterly believably, that his bro
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6000"> ther, who is his manager, who manages affairs that he owns 95 per cent of, wanted to discuss with him what single decision could be taken to establish the total financial viability of his store&mdash;the movement of a Target centre into it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you think that there has not been a bitter precedent around here for what happens when you act in this way for relatives, apart from anything that directly interests you, contrast your position with that of a former Minister for Health, Senator Richardson&mdash;not acting for his own interests, not acting for something from which he profits, not acting in relation to something directly in his own purview as a minister, but simply as a minister. What did Senator Robert Hill say as Senator Graham Richardson left the affairs of this state, when a government with a bit of guts took a stand? He said this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He was making that contact on behalf of his cousin for no other purpose than to use his status, his stature as a Minister of the Crown in this government, to seek advantage, maybe, for his friend in the Marshall Islands.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">`Advantage, maybe, for his friend'. He was sacked for that. But it was not his friend who administered his business affairs. It was not his friend who walked into that place and said, `I want a Target shop in my shopping centre.'</PARA>

You are lucky in that we have a weak, worthless Prime Minister who cannot comprehend that fact and therefore you survive. But this House must be made of sterner stuff.

The Leader of the Opposition had to threaten his own frontbench because, good heavens, they were coming out with policy ideas. We cannot have that at all!

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As we have said on a number of occasions, and as I have said publicly on radio, and as I have said to any person who would want to listen, this particular issue is not, as the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser) claims, about the politics of envy. It is not about the minister's children and him visiting shopping centres. It is about ministerial conduct. It is about his position as a minister of the Crown and, importantly, it is about the standards and the code of conduct which the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has set for ministers in the government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On each one of those particular counts, this minister has been charged and, we believe, found guilty of misleading, of engaging in conduct which is absolutely contrary to the Prime Minister's guidelines and of engaging in conduct which, by any standards set by this or any other previous government, should result in this minister's removal. In the course of this particular debate this afternoon, and in the course of question time, on three separate occasions a charge was put to this minister to deny the substance of the question that was put to him last week and again put to him today. That question was: did he raise with Nick Greiner&mdash;the Deputy Chairman of the Coles Myer board, former Liberal Premier of New South Wales and not an insignificant person in Australia's commercial background today&mdash;issues about the development of a Target store at a greenfield site at Eaton, outside Bunbury, Western Australia, which the minister for small business owned? That was the question that was asked three times today and, on three occasions, the minister refused to answer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He refused also to substantiate his claims that he had done nothing wrong or, indeed, to answer that question in the 15 minutes in which he has responded to this censure motion. He would not answer that question in this place today. He would not answer it three times in question time. He must now answer to the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer). The Acting Prime Minister must go outside this place&mdash;I see he is in deep conver
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6004"> sation with the minister now&mdash;and he must call him around to the oval office. He must sit the minister down and have one of those little chats that the Prime Minister and ministers are becoming famous for in this government. If he does not satisfy himself as the Acting Prime Minister that this minister has done nothing wrong, then he too has failed this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that this Acting Prime Minister puts great faith in this parliament. He is one of the very few people that I can recall in times gone by that has actually stood in this place and spoken at length about the great traditions of parliament, about the roles and responsibilities of ministers in this place and about the fact that if ministers mislead, either deliberately or unintentionally, there are remedies to fix that particular issue. I say to the Acting Prime Minister: I am relying on that integrity that I know you have in respect of this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the issue at heart here? The issue is very simple. There is a code of ministerial conduct that this Prime Minister brought down and has given to each of his ministers and requires of them absolute adherence. One of those particular codes says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ministers must be honest in their public dealings and should not intentionally mislead the parliament or the public.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is what this issue is about today. It is about whether or not this minister has misled this parliament. The basis of the charge that has been laid is quite simple: it is conflicting evidence given in various newspaper reports and this minister's refusal to answer questions in the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He mocked the newspaper article when he said that if I read on I would find that something was completely different. Let me refer to one of those articles. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, on Friday, 20 June 1997, contained the headline `Prosser admits seeking help for family business'. The article said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Prosser told Parliament yesterday he had called Mr Greiner "four or five months ago to ask for a contact name in Coles Myer for my brother".</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The same article, one paragraph later, said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Prosser told <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Australian</EMPHASIS>  on Wednesday that the only contact he had with the Coles Myer directors since becoming a minister had been social.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Two days before, he told a journalist from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> , `Yes, I had met with some directors of Coles Myer, but it was social.' He is quoted as saying, `Four or five months ago I asked for a contact name in Coles Myer for my brother.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Is that significant? Indeed it is, because again the ministerial code of conduct is very specific on this. The ministerial code of conduct says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ministers are required to divest themselves of all shares and similar interests in any company or business involved in the area of their portfolio responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We have established that retail tenancy, franchising and other recommendations contained in the fair trading inquiry report come within the ambit of responsibility of the minister for small business. And he has been in the newspapers over the weekend, he has been on radio and he has re-established that fact. This therefore can be no clearer. It is in absolute breach of that. If that does not satisfy this minister, the other sentence in that code says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The transfer of interests to a family member or to a nominee or trust is not an acceptable form of divestment.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Minister, you stand up in this place and say, `My brother does all the work.' The company records show that you, your brother and your wife are the people who own all of the businesses with which we are concerned. This guideline captures the very essence of what we are saying.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Your brother, in your own words, as your manager, is carrying out work on your behalf. Your constituents, your tenants, say that you walk around on weekends. You say you are going down to buy some milk with your kids. That might well be so, but they say that you are there, you are friendly. You have hands on, as you admitted yourself on a small business program a couple of weeks ago. Then you go on to say that there is no contradiction, that social conduct and contact names to you are one and the same thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, you are the one who goes on television, who goes into the media and says
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6005"> that you believe in voluntary codes when it comes to dealing with small business. You go on and say, `I don't believe in legislative underpinning. I don't believe that we need to have support for small businesses other than voluntary codes.' Minister, you believe in voluntary codes because you think it is voluntary to comply with them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On this particular occasion, the voluntary code and the voluntary compliance that you have are the Prime Minister's code of conduct. You take these, you snub them, you basically give the old&hyphen;fashioned two&hyphen;finger salute to them in the face of your Prime Minister and you say, `I have dealings on new shopping centres that I own in my town of Bunbury. I want to get a new shopping centre with a Coles Myer tenant, that is, Target, and I'm quite happy to raise with deputy chairs of Coles Myer my concerns of the need to find contact people.' Then you come along to this parliament and, if not denying it, which you have done in this place, simply refuse to answer. And you expect us to turn around and say, `Oh well, that's all right, Minister. You must be right. You haven't got the day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day running of your business.' That does not mean you are there every day, Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You seem to be under the misapprehension that the prime ministerial guidelines require that you be in the office in Bunbury every day doing the work. That is not it at all. So long as you have some role to play&mdash;and you have admitted that you do through your brother and through your companies&mdash;you are caught by this code. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) made some comment about a comparison with what happened in the case of Graham Richardson. I think it is instructive to look at that for a moment. When Graham Richardson was Minister for Health, he also made a telephone call in which he asked for a favour for a distant cousin, as I recall. It is interesting and instructive to see what the now Prime Minister, the weakest Prime Minister in the history of Australia, had to say at the time. Back on 7 May 1992, in the parliamentary debate on whether there should be a suspension of standing orders to deal with the Mar
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> shall Islands affair, the now Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian people will judge this Prime Minister on the standard of probity that he is prepared to defend.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It could be the same bloke. He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The supreme test of the courage and probity of the Prime Minister is whether he insists on Ministers observing the basic requirements of a Minister, that is, that they tell the Parliament the truth.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">John Winston Howard, 7 May 1992:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister ought to be in here explaining Senator Richardson's lapse.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So too should this Prime Minister. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Better still, he ought to be hopping in the car, going out to Yarralumla and withdrawing Senator Richardson's commission. It is with great pleasure I second the motion.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">To do much what we are doing today. Acting Prime Minister, those words are the words of your Prime Minister when faced with exactly the same dilemma. The only situation that is different now is that this Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs, who has hands&hyphen;on involvement with his companies, contrary to the ministerial guidelines, also has responsibility for taking to cabinet and implementing the recommendations of the fair trading inquiry report, contrary to ministerial guidelines, and has responsibility for reporting in this parliament on questions raised about standards of conduct and ministerial probity and has the responsibility to respond in this parliament under our Westminster tradition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On each of those particular charges, this minister fails. Yet back in 1992, when pursuing a similar issue, this absent Prime Minister raised those issues in this place and called on the then Prime Minister to sack the Minister for Health for phone calls and for supposedly using his own ministerial office to assist somebody. It would be an absolute joke, if it was not serious, that this minister should not go back and reflect on that. Reflect though, Acting Prime Minister, on what Minister Richardson did. What did he do? He resigned. He understood what it meant and he resigned. This minister, though, says, `I've done nothing wrong. I come into this place on a daily basis and I do nothing wrong.'</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6006">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Acting Prime Minister, if you have not phoned the weakest Prime Minister in Australia's history yet, then I suggest you do so. You should get onto the telephone&mdash;perhaps use the same telephone that this minister phoned Nick Greiner with&mdash;and say to the Prime Minister in the UK, `Prime Minister, you remember what you said back in 1992 relevant to Graham Richardson? Well, we've got a bit of a problem here. One of our own has been caught out. One of our own is acting contrary to the ministerial guidelines that you brought down. One of our own is basically giving the two&hyphen;fingered salute to everything that you said you stand for about raising standards.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the weakest Prime Minister, who sees himself modelled on Menzies. This Prime Minister is away at a time when an issue of such significance is also before this parliament. It falls squarely to you, Acting Prime Minister, to respond to these charges.

This statement was received by fax in the parliament this afternoon whilst the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) was on his feet. I will now read this statement from Mr Greiner. The statement is headed, `The Hon. Nick Greiner, AO&mdash;23 June, 1997' and the title is `Telephone Call'. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I have previously indicated Mr. Geoff Prosser rang me. We had a short conversation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He asked me for a contact point within the Coles Myer Group for his brother.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I asked him to get his brother to write to me. I duly passed his brother's letter onto a relevant executive within the company group.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was no discussion between Mr. Prosser and myself about any of the details about which his brother subsequently wrote to me.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have not had any further discussions or contact with Mr. Prosser.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">At the conclusion of my remarks, I will table that statement. The point simply is that those remarks are entirely consistent with what the minister has said in this parliament. It is a serious charge to say that a minister has misled the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Normally when you get one of these censures based on misleading the parliament, the opposition would normally read through the transcripts in the parliament and then point to other material where they would then claim there was some misleading statement. That was mysteriously omitted from the presentation on this censure motion. It was no surprise that it was omitted; they had no basis upon which to make that allegation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Later we will come back to some of the other incredibly trivial material they raised here in question time about how often the minister went shopping with his kids. On their strongest claim&mdash;or should I say, the most excited part of their claim today&mdash;there was absolutely no shred of evidence to back up
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6007"> the claim they made. In fact, this minister, unlike the now departed Graham Richardson, has not misled the House. This minister has given a full statement of the circumstances surrounding this relatively minor matter.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will just give you the question and then you can listen to the answer. I have the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  for 19 June. The minister was asked by the member for Cunningham:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My question is to the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs. Has the minister, while Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs and with responsibility for retail tenancy and franchising, made any approach to, or had any communication with, any director or employee of Coles Myer or with former West Australian Planning Minister Lewis or his officers in relation to any business in which the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs has a financial interest, in particular the Eaton lot in Bunbury?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was the question. It was a pretty broad-ranging question. The answer is a long answer. Let me go to the relevant part. The minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As far as the Coles Myer matter is concerned, I rang Mr Nick Greiner four or five months ago to ask for a contact name in Coles Myer for my brother.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Greiner suggested that my brother write to him.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">All members of the House should read the full answer because it is a fair statement of those circumstances. Today all that the opposition could do was ask the minister whether he would mind repeating the answer he had already given. His answer was, `Well, I've given you an answer to that question.' That could not be more open. That is a fair response for any minister to give. You asked the questions; he answered with a response. Now for the first time, for all the hubbub, all
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the political rhetoric and all the point scoring and salivation going on over the other side, we now have a quite clear statement on this matter from Mr Greiner. I will repeat it for you.</PARA>

As I think I have conclusively demonstrated, there is absolutely nothing to support that. That is a serious charge. We took the censure motion because they are entitled, as the opposition, to put their case. But when you hear their case, there was nothing in it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6008">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second thing that they got very excited about was this claim, essentially, that the minister was in breach of the guide on ministerial conduct, and this relates to whether or not you can participate in work. The particular code of conduct words are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ministers (this and subsequent references to ministers should be read as including parliamentary secretaries) must not engage in any professional practice or in the daily work of any business.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This was one of the more pathetic questions asked by the opposition in question time today, if not for the month. They wanted to know whether the minister had some hands&hyphen;on conduct of the family business affairs. I am always a bit bemused by these things because, regardless of your position in federal politics, basically politics is a rather full&hyphen;time business. If you are minister, particularly from Western Australia, you spend half your time flying back and forward between Canberra and Perth. How you are supposed to be running a business in Bunbury defies all commonsense, just for starters. For two weeks now, the opposition has been attempting to claim that the minister is in his hardware shop or some shop or some shopping centre or whatever&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Collecting the rent with a couple of heavies on&hyphen;side! This is an incredibly busy minister! We had a couple of claims last week which were amusing to say the least. Today's one is that one of the tenants said, `Yes, we see Geoff around the shopping centre on weekends with his kids and whatever. He is a nice bloke.' The opposition are up&mdash;`Here it is; proof positive. This is the hanging offence to beat all hanging offences.' The minister responded to his question and, I must say, Minister, I thought you dealt very well in question time on this issue. I gather that you do not live far from this particular shopping centre.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is wrong when a bloke on the weekend gets an hour free and he takes his kids down to the shops? In fact, I remember Prime Minister Hawke telling Paul Keating that he should get into the shopping centres a bit more often. We like to have ministers with a touch of reality. We like ministers who will take their kids down to the hardware shop to buy them a few bits and pieces for their train sets. We like ministers who know what the price of milk is and what the price of a loaf of bread is. For heaven's sake, he should not be damned for that. He should be praised for doing that that, if he ever gets a few hours spare. He was telling me the other day that he is seen in the car parking lot, too, at this shopping centre! Oh, this must be sinister!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I said nothing about this any more today, there would be a question on this tomorrow. It would be their first question. Do you know why he is in the shopping centre a bit? It is because it is a big car park area and, if your kids have got a bike, it is a good place to ride your bike.</PARA>

It will brighten up the week if that is all it is going to be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that he has not misled the House. The reality is that he is not in breach of the ministerial guidelines. The reality is that this is a minister, as minister for small business, who knows about small business. Let us face it, with all the ACTU heavies on the other side, his crime is that, when he was 24, he had 80 blokes working for him in the construction industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did like some of the very benign colour pieces on the minister during the weekend when, in reference to one of the questions put to him, he said, `If you are aged 24 and you can give 80 people a job and you can deal
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6009"> with the CFMEU and the other unions, then dealing with this lot up here is all in a day's work.' And so it is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you get to the reality behind this, you are interested in politics&mdash;point scoring. On this side, we are interested in doing something for small business. We are interested because small business is the private enterprise backbone of this country. There was a very interesting statement put out the other day by a director and spokesperson for the Australian Small Business Association, on 20 June. His press release was entitled `A wasted afternoon'. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On Thursday, 19 June, 1997 I sat for a whole afternoon and watched a number of grown men and women, the leaders of our country, waste $1,000,000 trying to deprive an eminently qualified person of his job. I was sitting in the speakers gallery in Parliament House, Canberra (a building which I understand costs $2,000,000 a day to run). I was watching the censure motion on the Minister for Small Business, Mr Geof. Prosser. Mr Prosser is one of the most successful (if not the most successful) businesspeople in the House, having risen through the ranks of the Small Business community and through this, obviously having obtained a considerable knowledge of the wants and needs of the Small Business community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One thing which made my passive participation in this farce particularly irksome was the fact that I had an appointment with Mr Prosser to discuss a number of matters . . .</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the Senate the fact that members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960 are the only Australians to be deliberately excluded from eligibility for repatriation benefits in the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (the Act) for honourable `active service'. Australian Archives records show that
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6012"> the only reason for the exclusion was to save money. Members of the Australian Army and Air Force serving in Malaya were not excluded, and the  costs associated with the land forces was one of the main reasons for the exclusion of the Navy. An injustice was done which later events have compounded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are two forms of benefits for ex-servicemen, Disability Pensions for war caused disabilities (denied the sailors referred to but introduced in 1972 for `Defence Service' within Australia) and Service Pensions. Allied veterans of 55 nations involved in conflicts with Australian forces until the end of the Vietnam War can have qualifying eligibility for Service Pensions under the Act. Service by 5 countries in Vietnam was recognised after RAN service in Malaya was excluded. The Department of Veterans' Affairs confirms that 686 ex-members of the South Vietnamese Armed Forces are in receipt of Australian Service Pensions; 571 on married rate and 115 on single rate. In effect, 1,257 Service Pensions, denied to ex-members of the RAN, are being paid for serving alongside Australians in Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is claimed that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) Naval personnel were engaged on operational duties that applied to all other Australian service personnel serving overseas on `active service'. They bombarded enemy positions in Malaya and secretly intercepted enemy communications;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Naval personnel were subject to similar dangers as all other Australian service personnel serving in Malaya and there were RAN casualties, none of which appear on the Roll of Honour at the Australian War Memorial;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) the Royal Australian Navy was `allotted' for operational service from 1st July 1955 and this is documented in Navy Office Minute No. 011448 of 11 November 1955, signed by the Secretary to the Department of the Navy. The RAN was then apparently `unallotted' secretly to enable the excluding legislation to be introduced;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) the Department of Veterans' Affairs has said it can find no written reason(s) for the RAN exclusion in the Act. In two independent Federal Court cases (Davis WA G130 of 1989 and Doessel Qld G62 of 1990) the courts found the two ex-members of the RAN had been `allotted'. Davis had served in Malaya in 1956 and 57. As a result of these cases ex-members of the RAN who served in Malaya and who had, at that time, claims before the Department of Veterans' Affairs for benefits, had their claims accepted. Eight weeks after the Doessel decision the Act was amended to require allotment to have been by written instrument. In parliament, it was claimed the amendment was necessary to restore the intended purpose of the exclusion, reasons for which can not, allegedly, be found.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) Naval personnel were not, as claimed, bound by the `Special Overseas Service' requirements, introduced in the Repatriation (Special Overseas Service) Act 1962. This Act became law some two years after the war in Malaya ended;
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(f) as Australian citizens serving with the Royal Australian Navy they complied with three of the four requirements for `active service'. The fourth,  for `military occupation of a foreign country' did not apply to Malaya.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your petitioners therefore request the Senate to remove the discriminatory exclusion in the Act thereby restoring justice and recognition of honourable `active service' with the Royal Australian Navy in direct support of British and Malayan forces during the Malayan Emergency between 1955 and 1960.</PARA><PRESENTER.BLOCK>by <PRESENTER><NAME NAMEID="HK5">Mr Andrews</NAME><FROM>(from five citizens)</FROM></PRESENTER></PRESENTER.BLOCK></PETITION>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Nowhere are the banks held in such low esteem as in the bush. Rural Australia was brought to its knees by the combination of commodity crashes, droughts, foreign currency scams and high interest rate policies in the 1980s. It has never recovered. Now, in recent years, banks have made a mass exodus from country towns. More than 50 branches have gone in western New South Wales and the philosophy of the banks today is: do not be the last to leave town.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For many it is not simply a case of going to another bank down the road, because it often means travelling 60 kilometres, 80 kilometres or 100 kilometres. Now the Commonwealth has closed its agency at Sofala general store to save $7 a week. To that end, recommendation 95 of the Wallis report, that governments expedite alternative means of providing low cost transaction services for remote areas, should be implemented with haste.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having creamed off the bush in good years, banks have now turned their backs on many farmers and small business. It is not uncommon for many to be paying rates as high as 12 per cent, 13 per cent and 14 per cent&mdash;double the standard home mortgage rate. The banks argue that farmers pay rates according to their business risk, yet studies by Orange Agricultural College show banks grossly exaggerate that supposed risk. In actual fact, farmers are one of the safest business groups.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6016">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The utter contempt of most major banks was demonstrated with the latest fall in interest rates with the ANZ the only major to pass on the full half a per cent cut&mdash;this at a time of massive bank profits. The response of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) is to talk about red hot competition, but there must be government intervention too. One scheme being promoted in rural New South Wales is a rural loan cooperative catering for rural borrowers and taking into account seasonal income and sporadic cashflow. But it requires a federal government guarantee and, with the marketplace mania that this and the previous government are infected with, I doubt the government has the vision or the will.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Competition, in fact, can become part of the problem. New players without huge overheads, like Aussie Home Loans, will force the banks to recoup lost margins through higher fees and charges. Buildings and staff are the existing banks' biggest overheads and more redundancies are certain as new players begin to compete in this area&mdash;and those without a specifically rural obligation will not be setting up in small country towns the existing banks have abandoned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The local credit union, as was the case in Kandos in my electorate, might hopefully be the exception to that, but they need to be liberated even more&mdash;thus, recommendations 47 to 50 in the Wallis report pertaining to new entrants should be adopted to allow more sympathetic community support and investment by non-bank entities. But we cannot simply rely on competition to deliver adequate banking services to rural and regional areas in particular. We need a combination of competition and government regulation to ensure all Australians get the service they are entitled to and that groups such as farmers, who have traditionally relied heavily on finance, are not exploited.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the United States, the Community Re-investment Act, in place for 20 years, requires financial institutions to serve the needs of their communities. This is to stop the former policy of red&hyphen;lining, which allegedly disfavoured credit risk neighbourhoods, thus creating even poorer areas. Such red&hyphen;lining is
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in practice by major banks in rural areas today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The American act requires the donating, selling on favourable terms or making available rent free a branch of the bank to so-called `minority depository institutions' when that bank leaves town. It includes regular publishing of credit evaluations on banks and other institutions, including how the bank is helping the credit needs of the entire community&mdash;housing, farm, local government, low income and high income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Oh for such community service obligations in the Australian banking system. Here, Mr Treasurer and your Treasury marketeer zealots, is an idea from the temple of the marketplace&mdash;the US&mdash;and it involves more government regulation. How scandalous! Wallis's corporation financial services and Australian prudential regulation commissions are promising but do not go far enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The banks and their tactics are so much to blame for the lack of business confidence, the lack of venture capital and the lack of farm support in this country. Home borrowers are defaulting at escalating rates. Never in recent history have so many businesses been going bankrupt. There is a direct line through this to our appalling unemployment rates, especially in rural areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So let us get real with the banking system, Mr Treasurer. Let us make credit a positive economic tool, rather than the manipulative profit earner, with no community service obligation, of the major banks in this country. I commend this motion to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was not long ago that banks were an important part of towns in rural and regional Australia. They provided communities with credit, access to financial advice and, above all, a place where residents could do the type of everyday banking that people in cities take for granted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6017">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Country Australians honestly believed that, in return for the opportunity to do business with them, banks would recognise that they had responsibilities&mdash;that they would not up and leave simply because rural banks were not as profitable. How wrong we were.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The behaviour of major banks in rural Australia has been nothing short of disgraceful, with my electorate of Gilmore being a good example of how heartless some banks have been in their approach to smaller communities. Towns that were built around banks&mdash;which were seen as providing a good and stable environment&mdash;have seen their banks close down one after the other. Towns that have existed for generations simply cannot survive with no easy way of doing basic weekly banking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amazing part of the story is that these banks do not always close because they are not profitable, but simply because they are not making the huge profits of their city counterparts. Big money alone dictates bank ethics in today's world. Sadly, those bullyboys are given state protection to save them from real competition and they forget middle Australia which has supported them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If banks have the power to make and break communities, if they are willing to decide which towns survive and which go under, they must also be prepared for the community to fight back and demand to see their credentials. To my constituents in Gilmore who are left without banks, I say, `Consider your alternatives. Turn to financial institutions that care about rural and regional Australia and, if that means turning to the credit union industry, then do so without a moment's hesitation.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Wallis report looked into these areas of concern, and its recommendations understandably wiped the smirk off the faces of the big banks. It has been suggested that, if credit unions are prepared to work for rural Australia, then they should be given the chance to operate, and I would be the first to support this type of increased competition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Wallis report found that the Australian financial system costs users in excess of $40 billion annually. The credit union industry argues that increased competition could save
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> $4 billion and could offer real alternatives to the major banks&mdash;banks which time after time work against their clientele, which fail to pass on to the public interest rate cuts and which charge extremely high rates simply for the privilege of doing business with them. Yet credit unions are denied the right to function as banks, and rural Australia continues to struggle under the weight of the questionable decisions of the major banks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">South Coast member Eric Ellis has taken a particular interest in these and other troubling aspects of the banking industry, having been approached by many victims of the banks' indifference to the plight of average Australians. One family in particular, the Egans, lost their business, health and assets to unscrupulous banks. We soon found out that the Egans were not alone. Another constituent, Mr Martin Grimson, also comes to mind, as do many others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were examples of unauthorised loan accounts being created, wrong interest calculations, funds transferred from one account to the other without the customer's authorisation leading to penalty charges, interest rates altered in the term of the loan, mystery charges which were never explained, correspondence which is never acknowledged and unhealthy or unethical relationships between solicitors and banks. The list of abuse simply never ends.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I urge the full implementation of the Wallis report's recommendations, which would promote competition amongst the banks, credit unions, building societies and insurance companies, reduce the cost of regulation in Australia, ensure competitive neutrality and provide all depositors with the same level of protection by supporting the Australian Prudential Commission. I support the motion.</PARA></SPEECH>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6018"> standing the comments from time to time by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) about how interest rates are being driven down, there is no doubt&mdash;particularly for small businesses and the rural sector&mdash;that interest rates are still very high in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what are the effects of cuts in the official lending rate by the Reserve Bank? It is not obligatory for banks to follow any cuts made by the Reserve Bank&mdash;nor would this or the previous government want to legislate to make that a requirement. Rather, the complex relationship between the Reserve and the commercial banks would usually tend to encourage mimicking once a change is made to interest rates. The cost of money, through lending and borrowing, and the cost of Commonwealth bonds are perhaps the most significant influences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, it is the intention of this government to create an environment of confidence and financial prosperity&mdash;at least it says that. We have seen the Treasurer constantly claim that, by creating the conditions for interest rate cuts on home mortgages, the government has given average Australians significantly more money in their weekly pay packet which can be reinvested or spent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting, I might point out, that, at the time the Treasurer was trying to put pressure on the banks to drive down interest rates, the Australian Taxation Office was effectively charging a penalty interest rate of something like 19 per cent. That is one of the government's own policy rates. So the government is being a little two-faced there, but at least the Treasurer agreed to have a look at it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government wants to regulate the market indirectly by creating the type of environment which would increase prosperity, it must ensure that the inputs it makes will guarantee the results it wants. Clearly, the need for the banks to follow cuts in official interest rates is a highly political issue. Any doubt about this was evidenced by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), who had previously described those who criticise some aspects of the conduct of banks as `bank bashers' but then joined them unreservedly when the banks chose not to follow his agenda. So we see that
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the question of rates is becoming highly politicised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why wouldn't banks drop their rates immediately and to the full extent that the Reserve Bank has from time to time? The general consensus amongst commentators was that the banks had asked the question, `Can we make more money by delaying or reducing the level of the rate reduction?' and their answer obviously was yes. Anyone who might doubt this has only to look at precedent. In the past, the banks have shown that they can and do immediately pass on increases in interest rates. They stood to make millions of dollars by delaying increases and millions more by not adopting the full rate cut.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I clearly recollect the leader of the government in a past period attacking the banks for their margins. I can also recollect raising that matter with another senior shadow minister who now has a very senior cabinet position. I said, `I think the member for Flinders is exactly right. Why aren't the coalition pursuing this?' Mr Reith replied, `Why should we? They are our biggest supporters.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The commercial banks are not responsible to those people who maintain their accounts with them other than through legislative protection or by the desire to maintain customer loyalty. Banks are large multinationals which trade around the world, rate their profits in hundreds of millions of dollars at present and are seen as very profitable enterprises. Their primary responsibility is to their investors and shareholders, who will generally see the profit motive in trading as clearly outweighing the needs of account holders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Small, private savings accounts are not a lucrative business for the banks. They have effectively tried to discourage the operation of these accounts by imposing significant penalties on most accounts. The Commonwealth and state governments have acted with com plicity in this discouragement of personal savings in bank accounts. They impose federal and state charges and an unrealistic deeming rate on pensioners. All of these things affect the national savings psyche. No wonder we have pitifully small levels of private savings in Australia, especially in bank savings accounts.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6019">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will conclude by observing that the recently announced budget taxation incentive for personal savings is in fact a regressive move, because it is a net transfer from those who cannot save to those who can&mdash;in other words, the poor who cannot save are effectively subsidising those who can. I can clearly recollect a previous Leader of the Opposition, John Hewson, in answer to a question about the specific suggestion to give those sorts of incentives, saying that it would not encourage one extra dollar of personal or national savings in the country because it represented that transfer in the public account from those who cannot save to those who can. Even when the government tried to intervene, as it did in this particular instance, it did it in the wrong way by requiring a transfer from the poor to the people who can save. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The past two or three decades have seen a sea change in the approach of our major banks. I do not think anyone would question the right of banks to carry on normal commercial activities within certain limits or to make decisions compatible with their normal business interests. But what we have to realise is that banks also have a responsibility&mdash;a responsibility to their customers, a responsibility to their employees and certainly a responsibility to the broader community, especially given the special place that banks have held in the community and the position of trust that they had been given in the past.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a shame that we have not always seen such obvious displays of that reciprocal obligation by the banks. In fact, we have several areas of concern. First, over the question of interest rates and, in particular, the latest cuts in official interest rates, we have seen only a partial response from the banks to that 0.5 per cent cut in interest rates late in May&mdash;initially only to pass on 0.35 per cent of that, with one bank, the ANZ, standing out with the full cut.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point is that we have seen significant timelags in passing on interest rate reductions. Over the past year, large business loans have had a delay of two weeks before
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the rates have been passed on, small businesses have had to suffer a delay of five to six weeks and existing mortgage holders have had to suffer delays of six to seven weeks before receiving the benefits of the cuts in official interest rates. Yet, in 1994, when we saw the latest tightening of interest rates, the banks were very hasty to pass on the rises, averaging only two weeks. They are very slow to pass on reductions in rates but very hasty to pass on increases in rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In response to the latest cuts in official interest rates late in May this year, we found not all the banks even willing to pass those on to new customers and, for existing mortgage holders, there will be a probable delay until middle to late July before the benefits of those cuts are actually reaped. So far, only one bank has cut the indicator rate for small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Third is the question of branch closures, which has already been referred to by a number of honourable members. Over the past five years, the four major banks have lost 758 branches, regardless of the inconvenience to local communities and the impact on their local customers. Two years ago, the Westpac Bank moved out of North Richmond, which is in my electorate. Earlier this year the last bank there, the State Colonial Bank, decided to close down, leaving no bank directly servicing that local community of close to 20,000 people and 200 small businesses. Sure, people can travel, but it is a shame that they have to do that and it is a shame that there is not a greater sense of responsibility by the banks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fourth is the treatment of small business. Certainly, business rates have not come down as fast as mortgage rates. The indicator rate for small business loans has dropped 1.5 per cent in the last year, but only one bank has responded to the latest cut in official rates. Most business indicator rates are still at 9.75  per cent&mdash;two to three per cent above average mortgage rates. This is only the indicator rate which does not allow for the extra premium for risk often arbitrarily imposed by the banks to beef up their own profit margins. We need greater reductions for small businesses, particularly since they are having difficulty
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6020"> accessing affordable finance and recovering from the 1991 recession; and many of them are wanting to expand and to generate jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also see the unreasonably harsh and inflexible treatment of small businesses. Banks are not aware or concerned about their needs, threatening them with foreclosure and fobbing off their complaints. I have many of these complaints from small businesses in my area. Many complaints have gone to the banking ombudsman and have not received adequate treatment there. What has been the result? In the housing markets, we have had banks losing market share&mdash;from January 1994, 93 per cent of market share down to 84 per cent of market share in January 1997. If the banks cannot start to act more responsibly towards their customers, employees and the community in a climate when they are recording record high profits, they will continue to lose market share in the way that they have in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly profits are at record levels. In 1996 we had an increase of 10.4 per cent in profits over the previous year, with profits for ANZ $1.125 billion; Westpac, $1.135 billion; Commonwealth Bank, $1.14 billion; and National Australia Bank, $2.1 billion. Interim profit figures for this year indicate that all of those are looking better, that all of those banks are going to record even greater record profits in the next year. With an average return on shareholders' funds of 16.5 per cent, banks need to be more responsible to their community. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pleasure to speak on the motion moved by our colleague the member for Calare (Mr Andren) in the House this afternoon. As I think most members would recall, back in the early 1990s I had the great pleasure, along with my friend and colleague the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker), who I see now taking on the responsibility of monitoring banks and financial institutions in this place, of conducting a very extensive inquiry into the Australian banking industry. It was at the time, I suppose, a report card on five years of banking deregulation. Something like 104 conclusions and recommendations were made to the government of the day. I am
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> pleased to say that many of them, if not most, were acted upon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were concerns raised at the time&mdash;I think they are still the sorts of concerns that are around now and that are contained in the motion moved by the honourable member for Calare&mdash;concerning things like the failure of banks to adequately pass on interest rates reductions, certainly to pass them on at the same pace as they seemed to put them up when the reverse situation occurred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In reference to small business, which the last speaker was referring to, it is fair to say that a margin is imposed on small business lending by banks which is, I think, unacceptable and which is discriminatory in many ways. It is so because in most cases what small businesses and small business men and women in this country have to do is to put as security mortgages on their homes and many other assets they have to access business finance. One of the questions that arises in the report on fair trading, which was tabled in this parliament a few weeks ago and in which we have seen some interest in recent times, goes to the issue of access to finance. It is a question for small business which really needs investigation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fortunately the Wallis committee did make some comments about that and more generally about the structure of the Australian banking industry. Some people have suggested that Wallis really did not make any recommendations that differed greatly from what was contained in the House of Representatives banking committee report in 1990-91. In some respects I think that is quite right. But there were other recommendations in respect of the number of banks that should be allowed to operate in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have constantly said since those inquiry days, the fact that there are banks in this country&mdash;the four majors and regional banks, and building societies and credit  unions and so on&mdash;is very important for different levels of consumers. We must constantly strive to ensure that that landscape does not change too greatly. We need to act on what our recommendations were and what Wallis has recommended, for example, in providing access to the payment system by
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6021"> credit unions and building societies because in that way those financial institutions will be able to provide directly many beneficial marketing opportunities and lending opportunities for people in small business and for ordinary consumers who want access to funds without perhaps all the fees and charges which the banks, with their user&hyphen;pays principles, seem to be levying today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of branch closures, again I can understand the concern that speakers in this debate have raised in this place today. In my own electorate of Cunningham, and even in Hughes and probably south in Throsby, what we are seeing is rationalisation&mdash;the glamorous term that is used when banks decide they are going to cut down branches and locate them in one or two major suburban areas outside the CBDs of major cities. It gets worse in country areas. The argument that the banks put forward is that with the access to EFTPOS facilities there might be in post offices or in general stores or whatever, generally speaking people will have access to ready cash when they need it and, given that often in country areas people have to travel to larger towns once or twice a week, they will be able to combine their shopping trips with going to the banks. The trouble is that, because so many branches have shut down, the waiting times and the queues and so on in banks from my experience in recent times has certainly extended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a need to examine always and to keep honest the banks in this country. I am delighted that the member for Wannon chairs a parliamentary committee that from time to time gets the Reserve Bank and others in front of them so that they can question them about their approach to banking issues. I agree essentially with the sentiments contained in this motion today. It is important that we as a parliament are ever vigilant in respect of banks in this country. They underpin the entire economic and social fabric of our nation. They always have, and they always will. We do not necessarily always have to be suspicious of them but we always have to be mindful of them. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pleasure to follow the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Martin). As he rightly points out, I have the honour of chairing the committee that he used to chair in the previous parliament, and I have certainly become very conscious of some of the points that are raised in this motion. I say to the honourable member for Calare (Mr Andren) that I have much sympathy with many of the points that he and other participants in this debate have raised. All of us are very conscious of the difficulties that country people are facing, particularly when the last bank in the town closes, and with what it means for that town. I suppose like most who represent seats like this, I have been actively involved in trying to keep some of those branches open.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I did notice that the member for Cunningham was very cautious in the way he stepped around some of the most contentious parts of this motion. I suppose with his experience and with what I have subsequently learned I too would like to look at some of these issues without necessarily fully endorsing the motion but nonetheless making the point that I do feel that decision makers are facing a dilemma. The member for Calare talked about the need for a combination of competition and government regulation. I suppose it is true to say that we do have that today, but equally one might argue as to whether or not that needs refining because clearly there are great concerns amongst many parts of the community about what is happening to the access to the services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, some hope is held out for what might be the government's response to the Wallis committee. I caution that, while the Wallis committee does talk about widening access to services and other forms of financial institutions accessing these different services, the fact is that the Wallis report is more of a framework rather than a prescription of how this might best be progressed. With that in  mind, I would like to look at a couple of the points that have been raised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While it is true that the banks may be a little tardy in handing on some of the falls in
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6022"> official interest rates that have occurred, nonetheless it is also true that since this government was elected we have seen four falls in rates, totalling two per cent, but at the same time the variable home mortgage rates have fallen by at least 3.3 per cent. I think that in itself indicates that the major thrust of this government&mdash;namely, increasing competition&mdash;is showing some benefits for consumers. So the push for competition is in fact having some effect and we are certainly seeing some of the benefits of not only the cut in official rates but I suppose more importantly the better economic management of this government being passed on to at least one sector that is borrowing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know from my role as Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Financial Institutions and Public Administration we do have the opportunity to question the Governor of the Reserve Bank. I assure the member for Calare that this is an area about which we questioned the Governor in some detail and, while he may not be able to provide us with all the answers we want, he has made it quite clear that he sees the next area where this competition will force down rates is in the provision of lending to small business. There is no doubt that all members can instance examples of where the margins and the rates that are being offered to small business have been significantly higher than those offered either to big business or to home borrowers. We should not lose sight of the fact that the government's thrust is to increase competition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of other points that I could bring up but unfortunately time is fairly limited. This is an area of great concern to many Australians, particularly in regional areas. It is a complex problem. It is one that I believe the government has to be sympathetic about in finding solutions that will ensure that those who live in regional areas do have proper access to services on a comparative basis to those living in the major centres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Calare is to be commended for bringing this motion before the parliament because this issue should have a proper airing. It should be properly debated, and I believe
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> it is an issue that the public has every right to ask their elected members to bring to the attention of the parliament and the government.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Members of this place would be well aware of the act of treason by the leaders of the union movement in Western Australia recently over the industrial relations legislation introduced by the democratically elected Western Australian government. I will detail to the House the extent of those actions, but let me say at the outset that the actions by the union movement over recent weeks have been contemptuous to our law, contemptuous to democracy and contemptuous to the people of Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Western Australia has Australia's most vibrant economy, the lowest unemployment and the best prospects for the future. This is not due to luck but due to the positive and progressive economic and industrial relations policies of the Western Australian govern
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6023"> ment. Nevertheless, those excellent results are being compromised by the union movement, who are more intent on protecting the interests of the likes of Tony Cooke and the hierarchy of the union movement than ensuring that our state's economy thrives and that more Western Australians have real, lasting employment with real, lasting benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let it be made perfectly clear that the actions of the TLC over recent months and the actions proposed for the immediate future will protect only one job, and that is the job of Tony Cooke. However, it will place at risk numerous businesses whose proprietors are risking their personal money to make a dollar and employ a few people and of course their employees. By taking the action the unions have reduced business activity, increased costs and harmed the economy. While the unions claim to represent the interests of workers, their actions paint a totally and completely different picture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation introduced by the Western Australian government was part of the industrial relations platform that the Liberal Party of Western Australia took to the people prior to the 1993 and 1996 elections. In fact, former Leader of the Labor Party in Western Australia Mr Jim McGinty, another union hack who was endorsed by the Labor Party, was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> of 12 September 1996 as saying that, if the coalition were re-elected, then this legislation would be reintroduced. History shows that the coalition was not just re-elected, as a result of the good sense of the people of Western Australia, but re-elected with an increased majority, and the coalition kept to their policy and reintroduced the bill. They were keeping to their mandate; they were ensuring democracy was adhered to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, as a result of the government keeping its promise, the union movement held the people of Western Australia to ransom. They undertook industrial action which was undemocratic, which damaged our economy and which was in spite of the overwhelming endorsement by the people of Western Australia of the Court government. The victim of this action was not the government; it was not the politicians; it was not the union leaders.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> The victims were the many businesses, large and small, and their employees, who lost work and money because of the actions of these unions, whose only objective was to protect the cushy positions of those in the hierarchy of the union movement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The decision the Labor Party in this place must take is this: do they support the treason of the union movement, instigated by Tony Cooke, Jim McGiveron and their cronies, which put many businesses and jobs at risk, or do they support the small business people and their employees, the battlers of Western Australia who were the victims of this nasty, expensive and obscene campaign against democracy?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The campaign by these thugs included petrol strikes and milk strikes. The volume of milk that literally went down the drain&mdash;it was tipped onto the ground&mdash;was appalling and unfair to farmers, milk vendors and consumers. There were electricity strikes. There was a bomb hoax on the Western Australian parliament. Damage was done to Parliament House. Damage was done to members' cars. They disrupted the main freeway in Perth during peak hour by hijacking it with their cars and driving down the freeway at 20 kilometres per hour, preventing people from getting to their employment when they wanted to and also preventing some people getting to the airport to meet airline bookings, et cetera.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the most indecent attack on our democracy was the storming of the Western Australian parliament to prevent the House from sitting. The message from these unions was this: `If we can't get our way over the democratically elected government, we'll stop the government from being able to operate.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, these unions have snubbed the law and are squatting on land opposite Parliament House which has created an eyesore and shows total contempt for our laws and for our democracy. It is important to note what these  unions were protesting over. The main aspects of the legislation provided for secret ballots before strike action; allowed employees to choose whether they donated to political parties, not forced them to; allowed workers to choose whether their union applied for
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6024"> federal coverage; and protected non-union members from having their personal employment records inspected by a union official.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I oppose the motion moved by the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Eoin Cameron) and seconded by the honourable member for Swan (Mr Randall). The honourable member for Stirling's motion talks in terms of condemnation. The member for Stirling bandies around like confetti notions such as treason and anti-democracy. If there is any condemnation that needs to be thrown around here, it is condemnation in respect of the Court coalition government in Western Australia, it is condemnation in respect of its industrial relations minister, Mr Kierath, and it is condemnation in respect of the honourable member for Stirling himself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Stirling's motion is entirely wrongly based. It is fundamentally flawed. If any consequences have arisen as a result of the industrial relations legislation pursued by the Western Australian state government through the Western Australian state parliament, then those consequences rest squarely on their shoulders&mdash;100 per cent on them, 100 per cent on the state colleagues of the member for Stirling, the member for Swan and the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans), who I see has skulked into the chamber to make the trilogy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why is this motion fundamentally flawed? Firstly, the industrial relations legislation of the Court state government does nothing for jobs, it will do nothing to reduce industrial disputation in Western Australia&mdash;on the contrary, it will massively increase it&mdash;and it will do nothing for job security. But let us first look at the context in which this legislation came forward. The honourable member for Stirling disingenuously and wrongly indicated that this was the subject of election commitments by the Western Australian state
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government in the run-up to the Western Australian state election. There was one aspect&mdash;secret ballots&mdash;that was the subject of a positive election comment by the coalition at the state level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what did we see in the run-up to the federal election in March 1996 and in the state election in December 1996? Just as we saw `GST' stamped on their foreheads in 1993, we saw two things stamped on their foreheads in 1996 at both those elections. One was `NCB', Noel Crichton-Browne&mdash;the erstwhile but great friend of the member for Stirling&mdash;and the other was `NTW', no third wave. That was what they handcuffed themselves to at the state level and at the federal level. You could not see them for dust in the run-up to the 1996 federal election. `No third wave,' they said. And that is precisely what they said nine months later in the run-up to the Western Australian state election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What gives you the clue that that is unambiguously true? They drove this legislation through the Western Australian parliament before the 1996 Western Australian state election results could have their consequence&mdash;in other words, before the state parliament of Western Australia properly reflected that election result. They rammed this legislation through by gag and guillotine before the true parliament came into being&mdash;before the Legislative Council, which was elected in 1993, had finished its fixed term and the 1996 Legislative Council took its place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another damning indictment was that, once the legislation was rammed through in the dead of night by gag and guillotine, they stood up and said, `We need a few months before this legislation can be properly explained to the public.' So they embarked upon a $300,000 propaganda campaign and would not proclaim the legislation for a three-month period.

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6025"> In relation to the provisions of the Commonwealth act, which the member for Swan, the member for Cowan and the member for Stirling voted for time after time, division upon division, the state legislation makes it an offence for workers to conduct themselves in a manner that is consistent with that legislation.

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, having established all this, the recent industrial action in April and May in Western Australia to demonstrate opposition to the changes to the existing industrial relations legislation was reminiscent of the August 1996 stampede by the union thugs at Parliament House in Canberra. As the whole country watched in disgust last year, this building which represents the entire nation was treated with absolute disrespect as it was smashed and torn apart. Innocent people carrying out their jobs were bullied and intimidated, and some were injured.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This year in Western Australia, we sadly saw the same thing happen again at the instigation of the Labor Party's mates, the unions. Obviously the Labor Party endorses these types of thuggish, bullying tactics in Western Australia and actively encourages the same disrespect the unions brought to this federal parliament in 1996. In Western Australia, they again smashed machinery and defaced the house, the damage costing thousands of dollars to repair. Members and staff were taunted, jeered, abused and physically threatened and intimidated by drunken union officials. Some parliament house staff just could not come to work for a couple of days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The unions tried to make it look as though they were directing their action towards the government, but they were not. Media attention was certainly focused around parliament house, but this was not a true reflection of what was going on. The unions were directing their action towards the most vulnerable sections of our community, the battlers. Hospital workers went on strike, affecting the provision of meals to patients, as well as sanitation services. Care workers looking after the disabled and the elderly were also coerced into taking strike action. Electricity was reduced in the homes of innocent people&mdash;some elderly, some very young, and some sick, including asthmatics and those on dialysis machines. This is utterly deplorable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Is it any wonder that union membership is declining at a rate of knots? Who would admit to being part of this type of association? Who would think that type of association could possibly do anything for them?
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6026"> They are an absolute disgrace. That is why they do not reflect the average Australian worker and should not claim to represent them. They are on their own. The Labor Party sat back and looked on and encouraged these people to stop work and grind the state's economy to a halt. An estimated $4 million was lost in the construction industry due to the day of action&mdash;or, in other words, inaction. An estimated $1.5 million was lost in the dairy industry, as the member for Stirling has indicated, as farmers just tipped their milk down drains. Transport workers, especially, did not get their produce out for purchase by consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party and the unions just cannot be serious about employment, industry, small business and the economy when they encourage this sort of thing. Strike action by tanker drivers drove petrol prices up for the ordinary customer. Many people were just immobilised as they were warned not to panic buy petrol. The Labor Party sat back and looked on as the unions blockaded the doors of the state parliament house in Western Australia and as unionists bullied and jeered at the members of parliament and their staff, who were simply there trying to do their job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party looked on, as union thugs&mdash;their paid union officials&mdash;believe it or not even ordered pizzas and brought them into the state parliament house in some sort of smart alec defiance of the laws. It only brought home the fact that these people were ill-mannered, ill-informed and totally disrespectful of the democratic system of government of our states and Commonwealth. The Labor Party looked on as the unions arranged for a bomb hoax to clear parliament house of workers and began to be obstructive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The President of the Upper House, Mr Clive Griffiths, having been jostled and punched in the kidneys at one point, thought he was going to be forced over the edge of a balcony with a 15-foot drop. Thankfully, this matter will be taken further by the courts. The head of the industrial action, union boss Tony Cooke, said he did not like the fact that secret ballots were to be compulsory. That was it. As I have put on the record before, that was the strongest thing that he could come up with
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in his poor defence of the opposition to state industrial relations legislation, which is fair and reasonable and, importantly, removes the bullying and union thuggery factor from the workplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Trades and Labour Council's assistant secretary was equally unenlightening. She said that the legislation was draconian and a breach of international agreements.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am obviously opposed to this motion. I think any thoughtful person would be. This represents an attack on the Trades and Labour Council for opposing something they were told they would not have to oppose. They were opposed to the third round of industrial relations legislation introduced into the Western Australian parliament this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation has been driven by an ideological fanatic and a compliant Premier. The Minister for Labour Relations is a man with a vendetta against organised labour, not least because they subjected his own record as an employer to some fairly unwelcomed but timely scrutiny. The union is not alone in this opinion. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS>, in its editorial on 24 February said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Labour Relations Minister Graham Kierath's actions have often raised suspicions that he is driven by ideology rather than reason. His so-called third wave of industrial relations legislation confirms these suspicions. Parts of the legislation&mdash;and the arrogant manner of its introduction&mdash;seem to be aimed more at provoking unions than fostering stability and fairness in the workplace . . . it is hard to escape the conclusion that the legislation he now has before the Parliament has elements of vindictiveness behind it.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Many people in the Western Australian community have seen that as well. Similarly,  Anne Burns said in a column the day after the legislation was passed:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Court . . . lacked the strength to steer the Government on a less dangerous path.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6027"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As I said, an ideological fanatic and a compliant Premier. The last attempt to introduce such legislation was made before the 1996 federal election. There was a huge, robust reaction from the WA community as a whole, not just from the union movement. It was quickly withdrawn, scuttled; they were told by their federal members to leave it alone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, when they went to the last election, they said there would be no more third wave legislation. The community as a whole was told during that election campaign&mdash;the state one following the federal one&mdash;that it would not be reintroduced in that form. That promise has clearly been broken by the introduction of this legislation. The changes already in place in the first wave have lead to increasing gaps in wages, particularly between men and women, and there have been stupid attempts to break union protection and support of workers' wages and conditions, particularly on the waterfront, where one Len Buckeridge was invited to take part in the industry. As a result of his failure, the state government has now had to cough up $1 million to get him to drop his legal action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is their record to date, and this is despite provocation. I must say, industrial activity in recent times has been at historically low levels. We have seen the government trying to buy a fight with the union movement. There is no apparent rationale at all for this third wave of legislation. No extra jobs will be created and there will be no reduction in industrial disputes. In fact, it would probably increase them. There will be no benefits for employers, and reduced job security will almost certainly be an outcome. Its clear aim is to reduce the effectiveness and scope of unions, to make their job of protecting workers' wages and conditions more difficult.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the House needs to know that the main elements of the legislation are, firstly, that before taking any action&mdash;stop-work meetings, bans, stoppages, strikes&mdash;workers will need to apply to the commission to hold a postal ballot. No-one is against a secret ballot, but the way it is being undertaken is absolutely ridiculous. It is a convoluted system which will take up to six weeks and involve the employer, the minister and inter
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ested third parties, who can all intervene. Each individual worker then has to give notice that he or she is going out and it can only be over pay and conditions. So nurses, for example, could not take action over poor patient standards&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Or teachers over reduction in funding to schools. The legislation outlaws it. The member should know that that is the case, and there are very severe penalties against individual members of $1,000 initially and $200 a day. Essential service workers will be defined by the minister according to his choice, and they will be barred from taking any action at all. Workers are not opposed to the secret ballot and the wider community is not opposed to the secret ballot. But this legislation is not about the secret ballot: it is about putting obstacles in the way of reasonable action. The right of access by unions to workplaces to check working conditions is obliterated. The new provision allows employers to dock workers their accrued annual leave under undefined conditions, and this has all been rammed through the parliament of Western Australia in an unprecedented way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government lost control at an early election and what they did was sit the now senator, Senator Lightfoot, in the place, incidentally delivering him an extra $400,000 in superannuation to push it through. They did not have the legal or moral authority to do so and the wider community showed, by marching through the streets of Western Australia, that they support the Trades and Labour Council in opposing this breach of reasonable standards&mdash;the reasonable standards of the parliament, the reasonable standards of organised labour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People are entitled to work together to protect their wages and conditions. They are entitled to use unions to do that. This legislation seeks to prevent them doing so.

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6028"> Cameron) and the member for Swan (Mr Randall). This is an important motion. The member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) said that I had skulked into the chamber. It is interesting to note that both Western Australian members have skulked out of the chamber on this particular issue: the member for Perth and the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence). The member for Perth also talked about the trilogy. The member for Swan asked why the member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson) was talking on this particular issue. The reason is that there are only three members of parliament from the Labor Party in Western Australia. The other one happens to be the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, and, of course, he is doing other important things. The replacement is the member for Reid, and he is a fine replacement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were some things said by the member for Perth and the member for Fremantle which need to be responded to. The member for Perth said that there is nothing for jobs in this particular legislation. Western Australia leads Australia when it comes to jobs; in fact, we have the lowest unemployment rate in Australia. Both the member for Fremantle and the member for Perth talked about the election result, asking why they are forcing through legislation when they were elected in December and had no legislation passing through both houses of parliament until May. Using that implication and argument, that means that, when elected in May, we could not pass any legislation through this place until the Senate changed in July. So that argument does not hold water in this particular debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Perth also said that the motion is fundamentally flawed, that business is not responsive to this. The head of Western Australia's small business association, Mr Ian Crawford, is reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> of 28 April 1997 as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Governments have power, unionists have rights but small businesses have no rights.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This legislation provides rights to small businesses. The member for Fremantle also said that there are no benefits in this particular legislation. I guess, if you are a union official there are none. If you are the ALP, there are none. But there are an awful lot of
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> benefits for workers because they now have choice about their workplace and their union and they also have choice as to how they want to deal with that. The member for Fremantle also spoke about pre&hyphen;strike ballots and I will come back to that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You must consider why there are people out on the streets on this particular issue. Why are they blocking the freeways, why are they marching, why are they disrupting the state and costing the state some $50 million in costs on one particular day? They are supported by the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Brand, Mr Beazley, and also by Dr Gallop who will repeal the legislation if and when he is elected. Mr Pallas, the Assistant Secretary of the ACTU, suggested that rights are at stake here and that it is the right of workers to withdraw their labour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us go directly to that because part of the legislation I have here talks about pre&hyphen;strike ballots. The member for Fremantle said that there are six weeks before a pre&hyphen;strike ballot can be taken. She was challenged by the member for Swan and she responded by saying that it is legislated for. It says in here:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any union member can call for a ballot and the WAIRC must endeavour to make a decision and give directions on a ballot application within three days.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Not the six weeks as determined by the member for Fremantle. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The WAIRC can appoint a registrar or its own nominee to conduct the ballot, supervise one conducted by a union or arrange for one to be conducted by the electoral commissioner.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Everyone is concerned about the pre&hyphen;strike ballots but they are covered here very well. The definition of a strike is given as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A strike is defined broadly as a stoppage, ban or limitation of work by five or more employees. However, there are various types of stoppages, bans and limitations which do not qualify as a strike, such as a refusal to work if there was a risk of imminent serious injury, harm or health.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Who would disagree with that? No&hyphen;one. It also says that a stop&hyphen;work meeting authorised in writing by an employer can in fact happen. So where is the concern here? The concern is  about the union movement not being able to access non&hyphen;union shops or have their fees collected for them. The concern really is the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6029"> union movement having to go out and recruit members harder than they ever had to before. Union leaders now have to work hard; they have to give their members some service for their membership dollar. They cannot just come into a place and throw demands around.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For sheer hide, it is widely acknowledged that the member for Stirling (Mr Eoin Cameron) takes the cake in this House.

The member for Stirling has a track record of trying to get on side again with the member for Swan (Mr Randall), the former Senator Crichton&hyphen;Browne and the good old boys in regard to his preselection situation. That is what today is about. It is not the first time that he has tried to divert this parliament from aged care, pharmaceuticals, the question of working for the dole and a variety of other issues by this kind of industrial relations diversion.</PARA></TALK.START>

It is not the first time that he has attempted this. He is a bit under a cloud with the member for Swan and other elements of the conservative wing of the Western Australian party on other issues. It is not the first time he has tried to get back in the good books with regard to this kind of policy area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also of some moment that this debate comes on the same day as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper sites two surveys, one from the Melbourne Institute and the other from AGB McNair on behalf of the Australian Business Chamber, which of course goes to real issues in this country&mdash;dissatisfaction of the broad electorate with regards to industrial policy,
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> employment creation and those kinds of issues. We have a situation today where this debate is fundamentally based upon the member for Stirling's personal need to keep his particular occupation. He has a hide to say otherwise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are very worrying aspects of this legislation. We have people over there trying to say that there are no great changes in this. One instance of this regards the inspection of books. This government has a very sorry record on human rights and civil liberties in this country. We have seen them attack legal aid. We have seen them attack the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. We have seen them not protect people's privacy rights with regards to outsourcing. At the same time, we have seen them stringently cut back the finances of the Ombudsman's office. The conservative parties have a very sad track record in this country over the last few years with regards to people's rights to take on the government, to challenge laws and to have their day in court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This question of the inspection of books is essentially about revealing to the employer those people on the site who are union members. I admit that in some cases it could be a very small minority of people. It could perhaps be only one person. To get access to these records in the future, there has to be a revelation of the individual's name.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Equally, we have not heard very good reasons why there has to be 48 hours notice. Up till now that has not been a requirement here. This is obviously about protecting a minority of employers who are defrauding their members. That is what this is about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also talk about the question of essential services. The people in this field have an even worse situation under this legislation. Of course, it is a broad attack on workers in general, but we find here that there is a requirement that they have to sign a `continuity of supply agreement'. Not only have they sought to bring in this legislation and rush it through the upper house in Western Australia, but even with regards to this matter, they  have not given the final say to the parliament or the people of Western Australia. They have

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister elected last year, Mr Sharp, wants a much bigger airport for Sydney's second airport facility. He has increased the scope and size of the plans for the second airport to some 360,000 movements per annum, an increase of one-third. But Badgerys Creek, the site that was acquired over a seven-year period by the former government, does not have sufficient land to accommodate Mr Sharp's bigger second airport.

According to local agents, it is becoming very difficult to sell in any of the suburbs of Campbelltown. Indeed, in most areas of Campbelltown, prices have either remained stagnant or have, in fact, fallen. Mr Frank Ward, representing the members of the Macarthur Real Estate Institute, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Members of the real estate industry share the anger that most of our fellow residents have for the Howard
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Government's attempt to move aircraft noise from the Prime Minister's electorate to the people of Macarthur . . . There are many residents who, for personal reasons, will have to sell their homes. As agents, it is our duty to assist them to achieve their objective and minimise any difficulty. Any effects on the home market by the Howard Government's betrayal of our area will be nothing compared to the damage to the health of our families and loss of quality of life caused by a Holsworthy Airport.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It has been well documented in the media in Sydney that the metropolitan area is experiencing a housing price recovery. Over the past year, house prices in Sydney have increased by 38.4 per cent in the eastern suburbs, 26.7 per cent in the inner city and 32.9 per cent on the lower North Shore.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Campbelltown has had an increase of just 1.4 per cent, the lowest increase of any area. This has been after decades of high demand and growth for housing in Campbelltown. The real indicator is the lack of any increase in the Campbelltown local government area and the huge disparity between increases in other suburbs. Quite frankly, Campbelltown is missing out on Sydney's housing boom just as we have missed out, due to the Howard government, in the investment in the orbital road, in services and employment growth. We are missing out on the opportunity for residents in the south&hyphen;west of Sydney to enjoy the home price benefits of Sydney's boom.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As figures for the Real Estate Institute of New South Wales illustrate, in June 1996, just after the government's Holsworthy announcement, the median house price in Campbelltown was $130,000. The figure for North Sydney at this time was $458,000. By September 1996, the median price in Campbelltown dropped to $125,000, while the figure for North Sydney rose by $10,000. By March this year, Campbelltown median prices levelled out to just $131,500 while North Sydney had increased to $477,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would argue that a major reason for Campbelltown failing to benefit from a Sydney housing recovery is the threat of Holsworthy. I am not alone in my conclusion. One of my constituents, Mr Wayne Simpson of Minto, recently wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the past three months, my wife and I have been trying to sell our house in the Campbelltown suburb of
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6032"> Minto, where we have lived for the past six years. Real estate agents in the area have told us that the house prices in this area have been affected by the Second Sydney Airport proposal. In fact, we stand to lose 20 per cent off the total price of the house just because the Government is not prepared to state the facts surrounding this whole airport situation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Simpson went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When I look at the options outlined in the Government's study, all I see is one big mess for the people that live in Sydney's South&hyphen;West . . . I would suggest that the Government bring forward its decision on this whole airport debate and let the residents of South&hyphen;West Sydney get on with their productive lives. At the prospect of losing 20 per cent off the sale price of my house, I wonder if you can advise me of where I might claim compensation for this loss. I have been living in Minto long before this new proposal was invented, and I would not have bought the house here if I knew that the Holsworthy option for a Second Sydney Airport was known at the time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This was a government that said it was for families. It said it was for young families trying raise their children and purchase a home. Here are residents in the south&hyphen;west of Sydney who have had that dream ripped from them because of the spectre of the Holsworthy airport proposal. This is a threat not just for the future, not just when an airport would be constructed under the Howard government, but for the present, due to the dramatic decline in relative home values in the south&hyphen;west of Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are concerns which are explained in housing price differentials for the rest of Sydney. They are experiences which are being felt right now by the residents I represent and who the Minister for Finance, the member for Macarthur (Mr Fahey), should be representing with an active voice in this parliament. Let it not be said that the government has not had the opportunity to consider these legitimate concerns from constituents about falls in housing values. The Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) agreed to answer 20 questions put to him by a local newspaper, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Macarthur Advertiser</EMPHASIS>. One of the questions was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Imagine a Labor Government announced out of the blue that it was going to build a 24&hyphen;hour international airport right next door to your Tablelands property . . . You had worked hard to pay your mortgage and now stood to make a big loss on any sale. How would you feel?
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Minister Sharp answered:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">See answer to Question 9.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What was the answer to question 9 in this survey? It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The management of potential aircraft noise associated with the second airport will be one of the issues addressed in the EIS.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It said nothing about home values or about how the minister would feel if a Labor government was going to build an international airport in his backyard. It said nothing about the government's deceit in failing to give any notice of this proposition prior to the last election. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) asked people to trust him. He asked them to regard him as `Honest John', but he was not honest enough to let people know in the south&hyphen;west of Sydney that he and John Sharp had plans for an international airport at Holsworthy which would destroy property values, cause anxiety all around and lead to massive concerns for the 500,000 residents in Sydney's south&hyphen;west.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once again, I urge this government to consider the harm caused to local residents due to the threat of a 24&hyphen;hour international airport constructed on Campbelltown's doorstep. These residents are not benefiting from Sydney's housing recovery. They are experiencing an ever&hyphen;increasing spiral of anxiety&mdash;anxiety about the future prospects of an international airport. There was no mention of it before the last election, but there are now plans to construct it just on the other side of the Georges River in Sydney's south&hyphen;west.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If it was not good enough to mention this proposal prior to the last election, it should not be built now and the government should understand, especially the Minister for Finance, that people are suffering anxiety&mdash;not just for the future but right now. They have concerns about their children's education and wellbeing and most of all about the absolute failure of south&hyphen;west Sydney to capitalise on Sydney's housing boom. This is costing money and peace of mind. The plan should be abandoned right now.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="6032"><TITLE>Food Safety</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to bring to the attention of the House
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6033"> tonight the need for uniform food regulations and hygiene standards in the Australian food industry. With the number of food poisoning incidents recently, the current plethora of different laws which currently exists around Australia is no longer adequate to properly address the issue of food safety.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Howard Government has taken the lead on the issue of food safety and, while much progress has been made, there is still much more which needs to be done. This year, more than any other in recent times, the issue of food hygiene and standards has remained firmly in the public eye.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an issue which affects each and every Australian, and particularly food producers like those in my electorate of McEwen, who depend on the reputation Australia has for clean, hygienic food for their livelihoods. We have all read the headlines of recent times, like the ones that said `Two Dead, 30 Ill from Salmonella', or `100 Ill in Pork Roll Poisoning Outbreak', or `Deaths Spark Meats Recall', or `Bugs in the Food System'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Two of the most publicised food scares this year related to outbreaks of salmonella poisoning, traced to ham and corned beef produced by a Melbourne smallgoods company and pork rolls from a Springvale bakery, both in Victoria. Then there were the Garibaldi sausage scandal in 1995, the Kraft peanut butter recall last year, the salmonella outbreak on an international Qantas flight last year and the recent hepatitis A outbreak resulting from contamination of oysters from Wallis Lake. The few food scares I have mentioned are merely the ones which have made headlines. There have been dozens more over the past two years alone which have led to well-known food manufacturers voluntarily recalling their products due to contamination by foreign bodies or bacteria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most frightening aspect is that, despite all our modern technologies, better surveillance techniques and greater knowledge, the number of food scares is increasing, leaving a trail of death, hospitalisation and illness in their path. This trend is reflected right across the country, with the number of reported food poisoning incidents nationally increasing tenfold in just three decades. I might say that,
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> unfortunately, I speak as a victim of some of these recent food poisoning outbreaks. Some have said it is a hazard of the job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia has a reputation for having one of the highest standards of food safety in the world. But that reputation could be damaged if we continue to read headlines like those that I mentioned. Australia prides itself on having food producers which are among the most efficient in the world. Our agriculture and food industry is the backbone of the Australian economy, providing substantial employment and billions of export dollars. The total value of our agricultural exports is nearly $20 billion, with more than $9 billion of this coming from the food processing industry alone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Australia, we have one of the highest food safety records in the world. Our reputation for safe, clean and healthy food has been built up over a long period of time and is envied by many of our trading partners. But, if we continue down our current path and do not take action to stop the increasing incidence of food poisoning and contamination, this reputation could cost our economy billions in export dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my electorate of McEwen, the food industry is the cornerstone of most local communities. McEwen is fortunate to have a strong and diverse food industry which includes wine and grape growing, horticulture, sheep, poultry, beef and dairy industries, as well as the new venison and cheese industries. If our food industry's reputation were threatened, it is rural and regional communities such as those in McEwen which stand to lose the most.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also cannot forget the human side to food safety&mdash;the many thousands of people who fall ill, are hospitalised or die as the direct result of food poisoning. This human cost is much greater than any extra financial burden we wear as a result of inadequate food standards. The mad cow disease scare which swept through the UK last year is an indication of what can happen if food becomes tainted. The link between mad cow disease  and the fatal Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans prompted bans on British beef and beef products throughout Europe and around
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6034"> the world, including Australia. More than 150,000 head of cattle were destroyed in Britain, thousands of jobs were lost, beef and cattle sales plummeted and billions of dollars in income were lost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A similar scare in Australia would spell disaster for our meat export industry, worth about $4 billion a year. The freeze on Australian processed meat and dairy imports into South Korea as a result of the anthrax outbreak in Victoria this year, the European Union ban on hormonal growth promotants in meat since 1988 and the recent interstate ban on Victorian grown apples and pears due to the discovery of a strain of fire blight are a very small taste of what we could expect if our food regulations, inspections and hygiene standards were to slip below acceptable levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Increasingly, foreign food markets, particularly in Asia and Europe, are looking for food which has high standards of quality, is nutritional and has clean production processes. The demand for food in Asia is growing by about $16 billion a year, providing excellent opportunities for Australian exports to niche markets. The government has already targeted Asia as a potential growth area for food exports. If we are to meet that potential, we need to ensure that our reputation for top quality food not only remains intact but continues to grow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is for this reason that the Howard government has taken a tough stand on the relaxation of import bans on uncooked salmon products and New Zealand apples and on undertaking stringent testing procedures before making a final decision on the importation of cooked chicken meat. While our stand has incited the wrath of trading partners such as the United States, Canada and New Zealand, we will not be deterred from protecting our vital primary industries and the communities they support and our reputation as a producer and processor of clean, green food.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The results of two recently completed food surveys prove that we can be confident in the general quality of our food. The national residue survey found that almost all our meat, grain, dairy, egg and horticultural products met good agricultural practice. The national
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> market basket survey found that all foods tested fell within the accepted international standards and safety limits for the dietary intake of herbicide, pesticide and other contaminants in food. This sends a clear and positive message about our food industry to not only food consumers in Australia but also to markets around the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The challenge for governments and for everyone in the food industry&mdash;from the smallest producer, to the largest food manufacturer to the local take&hyphen;away food shop&mdash;is to ensure that the food we eat and produce continues to be clean and risk free and that our worldwide image as a quality food producer is maintained. While that responsibility starts with food producers and food manufacturers, it extends also to the consumer. While action such as the introduction of food handling regulations, smallgoods quality standards and meat inspection reforms will provide greater assurance for both food buyers and our export markets, consumers also need to play their part in food safety. They need to ensure that foods are handled in a safe manner until they are consumed. These measures are very important to our industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australia New Zealand Food Authority plays a key role in our food industry by developing food standards, coordinating national food surveillance and recall systems, conducting research, assessing policies about imported food, and developing codes of practice within the industry. The authority has unveiled its food hygiene proposal which, with cooperation from industry and the states and territories, will create uniform national hygiene standards for the first time in Australia's history. The future reliability of our primary industries and the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of people who work in the Australian food industry depend on vigilantly maintaining and protecting our internationally envied reputation as a clean, green nation. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="6034"><TITLE>Fire Blight</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My grievance relates to the state of play with  New Zealand with respect to the handling of the fire blight issue. Last week I was in New Zealand with the House of Representatives
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6035"> Standing Committee on Primary Industries, Resources and Rural and Regional Affairs. Although we were briefed on the fire blight issue, there was more left unsaid than was passed on to us. They tried to convince us that fire blight had been in Australia for years. Although they referred to media clippings and findings from tests, no evidence was offered in evidence that the disease is established in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because of New Zealand's disease status, and the fact that it has fire blight, orchardists have to check for the disease 500 metres around orchards about every four months. As many orchards are close to towns, creeks and open ground with blackberries and other weeds, et cetera, this can become very expensive. We certainly do not want to have the same regime imposed on us&mdash;the New Zealanders are trying to level out the playing field by unethical means.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no other reasonable explanation as to why some of their scientists came to Australia and picked out two places to have a look at and then claimed to have found fire blight. It is extraordinary that, while claiming to have found it in the botanical gardens, searches of domestic gardens within a 20&hyphen;mile radius found nothing. Searches through orchards, at a huge cost to industry, revealed nothing, and Tasmania has lost a whole shipment of fuji apples to Japan because of this scare. Fire blight has never been discovered. The Tasmanian industry has been so distressed that they are planning to launch a class action against the New Zealanders for this intrusion into their industry and their ability to export.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This `must have at any cost access to markets' attitude is becoming the new reality. It is something that has developed because of the intense competition in domestic markets. If we allow countries to undertake raids on us with this sort of attitude, then our industries are going to suffer. Of course, individuals are certainly going to go broke and be pushed off their farms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There should be an avenue to protect our industries on ethical grounds. The scientific
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> argument is fine and should be undertaken with authorities being the main arbiters. However, the decisions made are political and, whatever science says, there are still the political realities. The political reality in Australia is that our whole interstate trade is disrupted and many people have to face the consequences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There should be some disincentive for countries which point the finger without using correct protocols. Why, for example, did the professor who was visiting for a conference and who found some fire blight wait two weeks before contacting AQIS? There are many more unanswered questions on this issue. There must be a way of protecting our industries from industrial sabotage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just look at the salmon industry. It would be a complete disaster if a disease were brought in deliberately. The industry is very concerned about the possibility of disease being introduced accidentally if Australia allows uncooked salmon into the country. New Zealand, like many other countries, is now undertaking risk analysis on its fish products imports. It understands the real problems faced by countries that have a disease free status, yet it still pushes this attitude of `must have at any cost' access.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We learnt that New Zealand has fisheries interests in Chile and that it has bought farms over there. However, these fish are not disease free and it makes it difficult for New Zealand to sell them to countries where disease entry is a problem. We were told about two container loads that were brought into New Zealand from Canada&mdash;one was sold but was in such poor quality that the market never developed; what happened to the other one is still anybody's guess. We get examples from other countries of the impact imports have on recreational fishing. There are different places in the world where recreational fishing has been greatly affected by the introduction of diseased fish.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In America, there are streams which are closed because of `whirling disease'. No fishing is allowed, and you can see the signs up. Our recreational fisheries do not want to  face that situation; neither, I put to the House,
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6036"> would the New Zealand recreational fishing industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The general attitude over there is that we have to break down barriers no matter what to reach the goal of no restrictions across the Tasman, which is all very laudable if you have a comparatively disease free status. But Australians are very aware that we have a better record than most other countries on many of these diseases because of our strict quarantine regulations in the past and partly due to the fact there have been tariff barriers as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One interesting thing we did learn in New Zealand was the setting up of a ministry of bio&hyphen;security, administered by a council. The idea is to pull together all scientific knowledge which they will utilise when arguing for access to other countries. We might well have to look at such a body. It may be required if we are to fend off other incursions of the apple blight nature. I would like to see this raised throughout the deliberations among the parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The New Zealanders have always been competitive and I admire the aggressive zeal they have in making sure that their products are at the forefront of new markets, but we should not be attempting to compete on each other's home turf. We can exchange information, we can develop ideas and, certainly, share industries, but not to endanger each other's markets. The four-day visit was very informative in lots of ways and their equivalent committee is visiting Australia this week, but we should continue to ensure that we respect each other's marketing potential.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we have a situation of capital and finance controlling where the market develops, we have to be aware of the companies' ability to be able to manipulate brand names. When discussing the package labelling question some years ago, we saw that, when brand names are packaged under an Australian label, they can substitute the raw material from other countries when supplies are short. I can remember at that time quoting an Edgells label from a tin of tomatoes. Written on the label was:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When adverse weather conditions affect supply of our Australian crop, we seek the world's best tomatoes, harvested when sunripened to perfection, rich red and full of flavour.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is the sort of substitution that can take place from one country to another. In other words, an Australian product can be substituted with product from anywhere in the world imported into Australia and merely canned here. The concern here is the substitution. The consumer cannot be sure that just knowing a brand name will ensure that the product is from Australia, New Zealand or anywhere else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Substitution is occurring in other places. We were told about Sainsburys in England selling lamb from New Zealand. The consumer knows of Sainsburys lamb, but not necessarily its country of origin. The brand name becomes the identity of the product. This will not be useful to Tasmania because we pride ourselves on the clean green image. Other Tasmanian regions are beginning to market under their regional names to try to offset the push for brand name rather than country identification.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The very real names of Tasmania, Hunter or Barossa would conjure up an image of excellence and people would seek out these products because of their regional name. Our regions are crying out for assistance to keep jobs and enterprises in them, yet they have to compete on this very unlevel playing field of capital `striding the world in seven league boots', moving the home of their brand names as the markets change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why, oh, why did Arnott's Biscuits get sold and lost to Australia? It was because Pacific Dunlop did not want to develop the line and the Americans saw the opportunity to break into Asia at our expense. We might make biscuits in Australia, but the profits have gone overseas and the administration has gone overseas. Therefore we have exported that number of jobs, and we are the poorer for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I believe government has a duty to be a facilitator, an intervener and, to a certain extent, a protector of Australian industry to ensure that we are a country that can compete&mdash;within the boundaries laid down by the World Trade Organisation, but not to try to  go beyond it is detrimental to keeping jobs in

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I grieve today for the difficulties confronting small businesses in Australia. Life has been hard for small business over many years&mdash;and it was never harder than under the Australian Labor Party&mdash;and they are finding the recovery extremely testing and hard to achieve. I want to grieve for them because I want to bring to the attention of the House some of the problems that have been created by the obstructiveness of the Senate and by the attitudes of the minor parties in that house.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to draw to the attention of the House the difficulties that any government has, particularly this government, in bringing change when there exists an attitude that seems to grudgingly agree with the general thrust of government action but does everything to frustrate bringing the government's intention to a quick conclusion. We have had budgets through this House which have taken nearly nine months to finalise. So, when there have been initiatives undertaken, when there have been changes to tax law, when there have been benefits which would flow onto small business, the Senate, particularly the Democrats and the Greens, I am sad to say, have made a great show of how thoughtful they are for the Australian community, but the real group which has been penalised by their delays and inactivity has been small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer especially to the changes to unfair dismissal laws, which were held up for weeks and months by a process of committee inquiry and delay and now have been rejected by the Senate. Where employees have been employed continuously for 12 months and where there are no more than 15 people in an organisation, the unfair dismissal laws have been removed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many people in small business say to me, `These laws don't really apply to us because it is very hard to administer them in small business. We are unaffected by them.' In fact, they are affected by them because some of the standards of their larger competitors are really pegged to the costs of paying for unfair
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> dismissal laws. Their competitors and their own environment preclude them from employing a person and expanding their business if they have a degree of uncertainty about that person's intention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An example in my electorate is that of a young businessman starting a new business. He employed somebody who completely misled him in their statements about their fitness to undertake the work. After some period of patience, he suggested they leave. The person left without complaint, but that young businessman found himself before the courts and fined to the extent of $10,000. It absolutely ruined his business. He could not afford the money. His young wife and young children were removed from that business, never to return. So we had another well&hyphen;intentioned, hardworking family irreparably damaged by the process of the unfair dismissal laws. The government sought to change those laws. The Senate did not wish that to happen, despite the result of the election just 18 months ago. It seems that result is not something the Senate is familiar with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there is the sale of Telstra. We now find that the sale is imminent and funds are starting to be released. Many jobs are being created for small businesses by the activities involved in repairing Australia's environment&mdash;all from the sale of Telstra. That sale was needlessly delayed for more than 12 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sensible restrictions and changes to the immigration laws proposed by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) to prevent people who have jumped queues or who are illegal immigrants from taking advantage of the goodwill of the Australian community were blocked in the Senate in the name of human rights&mdash;denying job opportunities and business opportunities to small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now we have the latest episode in regard to work for the dole, and we will see legislation in here no doubt sometime today in a message from the Senate. Work for the dole proposals are sensible. They are not geared to be harsh for young people, but again the Senate has sought to obstruct.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6038">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to get a message across to the people on the other side of this building&mdash;if you are really in such strong opposition to the government, your best course of action would be to allow the government to have its way without protest and, in a few months, try to make a very strong and compelling case to the Australian people that the government was hopelessly off track and that the government should be changed immediately. You could present that argument very easily but, no, you have to interfere, fiddle and delay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would seem to me that what is really happening here is that, by a process of conspiracy between the Australian Labor Party, the Greens and the Democrats in the Senate, you are seeking to delay, disrupt and make it appear as if the government has not got a commitment and is not competent. What you are doing is secretly agreeing with the measures. You know they are good. You endorse them in some form or another but, instead of saying, `We endorse them but we have reservations,' your process has been obstruction and delay&mdash;seeking to make the government appear ineffective in the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The damage that is being done is in fact to the small businesses and the genuine employees of Australia. I grieve for those people tonight, because they are the pawns in the unconscionable political games being played by the Democrats and supported by the Greens and the Australian Labor Party. I would have to say that the Democrats, in particular, are the ones who promote an idea. The Australian Labor Party, without any imagination or any sense of responsibility, jumps on that idea and says, `We will amend. We will send it off to a committee. We will delay. We will oppose.' So whatever the Democrats want to do, the Australian Labor Party endorses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has moved in so many areas to assist the very people that the non-government parties in the Senate are seeking to damage. We have changed our fringe benefits taxes for car parking and taxi travel so employees can get to and from work safely and without penalty. We have changed capital gains taxes, with relief for people selling businesses, people changing businesses and
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> people going into retirement from businesses. We have changed the exemption from unfair dismissal laws so that small businesses are no longer penalised by the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have cut red tape. The whole emphasis of the government has been to reduce the cost of the administrative processes imposed by government on small business. We have even said to small businesses&mdash;and this almost is an optional tax paying process&mdash;`Pay tax when you can afford it. Pay monthly, pay weekly, pay yearly. Whatever suits the particular mode of operation of your business, you will be invited to pay tax on that basis.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been incentives to increase small business finance. A $130 million small business innovation fund established with private funds for small, high-technology companies is on the way. That will be one of the most dynamic and revolutionary programs entered into by Australian financiers and will benefit employment and small businesses. There are fairer procedures to obtain government businesses. We have created 100,000 new apprenticeship places under the program, and we have even put in place a small business hotline.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would just like to remind the House in my last few minutes of a few statistics. Business interest rates under the Australian Labor Party were 24 to 26 per cent. We had the worst recession for 60 years, and the government of the day appeared to be proud of it. The foreign debt increased by 800 per cent over 13 years. We had the worst unemployment figures since the Great Depression.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I grieve for small businesses. Those attitudes that brought such a poor result for Australian families are now being demonstrated in a most severe, negative and obstructive manner in the Australian Senate as senators seek to prevent success. They know that the government has chalked out boundaries of success. They endorse them secretly, but they seek to obstruct them. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="6038"><TITLE>Lend Lease</TITLE>

Louise Martin, the Lend Lease Retail Chief Executive, says Lend Lease `measure our success by the success of our retailers'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How well does this claim stand up? The eatery at the Lend Lease&hyphen;owned Parkmore Shopping Centre in Keysborough is a disaster. Five of the seven outlets are in such a serious situation that they have taken out Federal Court writs against Lend Lease, alleging misrepresentation. When the solicitor for one of these small businesses, Mr Paul Russo, wrote to Lend Lease on two occasions in August last year asking for the independent body, to which the Lend Lease propaganda referred, to adjudicate the question of rent, he was told, `You talk to our centre management people and no&hyphen;one else.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At Anna's Boutique, the tenant is a woman of Asian origin with limited English skills. She got into rental arrears following misrepresentation by management. She was then conned by management into signing a legal release from indemnity. She thought that in signing she was merely gaining rent relief for three months. She did not have any assistance or representation at this meeting nor was she counselled to seek independent legal advice. She was dealing with a highly trained, skilled and devious manager. By signing this release, the woman had unknowingly waived all future legal rights of redress based on the alleged misrepresentations. I have a copy of the temporary rental abatement agreement that Lend Lease uses in these sorts of cases. Clause 7 says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The rental abatement is granted on the basis that neither you, your employees, your agents&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">or anyone else&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . disclose the provisions of this letter (other than as may be required by law) without the Lessor's prior written consent. If . . . you . . . disclose any provisions of this letter, the rental abatement will cease immediately and the Lessor will seek full refund of any concession provided. Any losses or damages incurred by the Land
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> lord as a result of your breach in confidentiality will also be your liability.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Clause 9 says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You agree to release the Lessor, its servants and agents from any liability resulting from any representations made to you at any time prior to, at the time of or after the execution of the lease.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So there it is&mdash;Lend Lease has its tenants enter into secret agreements where they give away their legal rights; and they are not even allowed to tell anybody they have done it! What does Lend Lease tell the public&mdash;the rest of us&mdash;about the kind of company it is? Its code of conduct, enshrined in every annual report since 1992, says that each individual must apply the highest ethical standards using the test, `Would I be willing to see what I am considering doing now described in detail on the front page of a national newspaper, there to be read by my family and friends?' If that is the test, why do they make their agreements with their tenants secret? Why shouldn't these agreements be out there on the front pages of our national newspapers? The Lend Lease code of conduct goes further. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any proposed action failing this test should be discarded even though it involves no legal impropriety. Lend Lease wants no part of activities that pass legal tests, but which we, as members of the community find offensive.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">If that is true, why has Lend Lease got a provision in these rental abatement agreements signed by small businesses, such as Anna's Boutique and Nagina's Boutique, by which the tenants sign away their legal right to sue for misrepresentation? If it is behaving ethically, and is not guilty of misrepresentation, why does it need a clause like that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is precisely because of this kind of bastardry by Lend Lease, and other large shopping centre owners which I have brought to the attention of this House in the past, that we need action urgently to better protect retail tenants and franchisees. We should have passed Kim Beazley's private member's bill, the better business conduct bill, and the government should certainly act to implement the recommendations of the House of Representatives fair trading inquiry, which carried out extensive investigations around the nation and found dozens&mdash;even hundreds&mdash;of exam
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6040"> ples of the kind of exploitation I have just outlined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Liberal government has as its Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser) a retail landlord: a man who owns three shopping centres; a man whose own income would be adversely affected if retail tenants and franchisees were to get improved rights and protections; a man who has already made it quite clear where he stands and who has already acted to the detriment of franchisees. In last year's budget he abolished funding for the Franchising Council which Labor set up to give franchisees an avenue for low&hyphen;cost dispute resolution. At the Property Council of Australia meeting held on 25 October last year at the Hyatt Hotel in Perth, the small business minister said about complaints by retail tenants about their landlords:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many of these complaints are either unfounded or at least one&hyphen;sided.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Did he say, as he said after his personal vested interest was exposed, `This is a matter for the states'? No. Did he say, `There is an inquiry going on and its recommendations will be considered on merit'? No. Did he say, `This is just a personal view. I don't speak for the government on these matters; they are handled by industry Minister Moore'? No. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the government's view that the landlords should be free to exercise their property rights in all but the most exceptional circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Prime Minister, John Howard, self&hyphen;proclaimed champion of small business, has put Dracula in charge of the blood bank, the fox in charge of the henhouse, a man who says, `I'm in favour of voluntary codes of conduct not mandatory, legally enforceable protection for retail tenants and franchisees,' a man whose contempt for John Howard's ministerial code of conduct shows that he regards voluntary codes of conduct with contempt&mdash;as just a joke. Australia needs a new small business minister. Prime Minister Howard is a lawyer by trade, and he should understand the legal concepts of conflict of interest and bias which make Minister Prosser's position absolutely untenable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister Prosser's personal financial situation depends on contracts with retail tenants

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude with two further examples which help demonstrate the depth of the problem. The Rombotis family were induced to enter into a lease at the Greensborough Plaza on the basis of representations that a state&hyphen;of&hyphen;the&hyphen;art Myer department store would be a major tenant at the redeveloped shopping centre; that there would be an increase of 30 per cent in the number of customers who attended the shopping centre once this development was completed; that Myer would not have a cafeteria or similar food outlet within its department store; that the multi-level car park would attract customers to the shopping centre, and that their turnover would be some $10,000 to $12,000 per week and would increase over time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What happened was that the Myer store was not a state-of-the-art department store, there was not a substantial increase in customers attending the shopping centre, the people concerned lost substantial sums of money in the business, Myer was permitted to open a bistro food outlet, turnover was not $10,000 to $12,000 per week but only $4,000 per

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, the Southland newsagency at Southland Cheltenham, during protracted lease negotiations from May 1996 to March 1997, was subjected to the intolerable pressure of being forced to trade on month-to-month tenancy for some eight months.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I would like to grieve about what I see as something we ought to have a growing concern about, and that is the growth of Big Brother, particularly as it relates to people who drive on roads, but also in relation to a number of other areas. My attention was drawn to an article in last week's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS>  entitled `Cops and Robots' which showed just how much high-tech is being brought into enforcement against drivers on our roads these days.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the first thoughts that sprung to my mind was that there seems to be this constant drive for greater conformity and, I would suggest, also greater subservience to our law enforcement on the roads. The question then arises: is this making for a better society or is it using high-tech in a very selective way as a means of trying to reduce road fatalities and road trauma, all of which we want to see occur? But is this the only way we might tackle this problem and is there an over-emphasis on this what I see as unprecedented use of technology in trying to achieve that aim?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The article not only showed that this unprecedented use of technology is continuing to grow as a means of enforcing the laws but also it made passing reference to something that I think we ought to look at a bit more closely, and that is the amount of additional
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> revenue that this law enforcement is raising, which brings to mind a number of other questions about the whole thrust of this road safety program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nowadays we have hidden cameras for speed, we have hidden cameras for red light running, we have more sophisticated laser guns for speeding, and we are seeing the trial of the use of satellites in hooking up to these guns so that a centralised data collection agency can mail out the bills even faster to collect the money even quicker. We see under trial things like intelligent parking meters that will be able to book you the minute you overstay on a parking metre without someone having to be there. We are seeing the trialling of black box recorders, which have long been in use in aeroplanes. There is now some suggestion that we may see the use of satellite tracking of private drivers. One wonders what that is going to mean when the question comes, `Where were you last night, dear?' and in regard to some of the other side-effects we might see.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My real concern about all this is that so much of it seems to be occurring with very little public scrutiny. The first question that comes to mind is whether this is being driven by the enforcement agencies or are the public really agreeing to what is going on. The next question that arises is this: what evidence is there for this continuing drive to employ ever more sophisticated technology to enforce laws where clearly there is a diminishing return, but not in terms of raising finance? The next question that arises is: does this cover other shortcomings in public policy, such as inadequate road funding, or insufficient driving training, or not concentrating on other bad driver habits? The question then arises: does society really accept the enormous and almost unfettered powers that are being given to enforcement agencies, far greater than they would have when it came to any other civil action in dealing with the general public?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Does the concentration on booking drivers add to a negative attitude by the public towards the police, thereby leading to less effective use of their abilities when it comes to other law enforcement activities? Is there evidence that this unrelenting enforcement is
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6042"> leading to better drivers? Often this enforcement is done in a very hidden way, with speed cameras being hidden behind bushes and so on. Is this leading to a better driver, given that the driver is not aware of the surveillance at the time?</PARA>

<PARA> </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8H4">Mr HAWKER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I was saying before the dinner suspension, there seems to be an overemphasis on enforcement. I really do think that society is starting to question whether or not the enormous and almost unfettered powers given to enforcement agencies may not be the only way to attack some of the problems we face with road trauma. It is very interesting to note on this point that social researcher Hugh McKay believes that the current approach is much more likely to lead to more frightened drivers rather than better drivers. That is a very significant point, given the enormous emphasis there has been on trying to intimidate drivers through penalties and the use of hidden cameras and new technology&mdash;I think often to the detriment of using the police force for its other duties in society and also to looking at some of the other issues that we should be concentrating on in trying to improve road safety.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This brings me to the next issue: whether or not the statistics actually support the ever tougher and more sophisticated enforcement of our road laws. Some statistics show that road traffic is increasing by about 30 per cent each decade. In other words, the number of cars and trucks on the road is continuing to grow. As has been shown by some earlier work, not only is Australia's road toll continuing to decline but it is continuing to decline very much in line with countries which have not enforced road laws with such ferocity as Australia has.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A comparison of the figures for New South Wales and Victoria is rather revealing, particularly given that in 1993&hyphen;94 Victoria booked 60 per cent more speeding drivers than New South Wales did, even though Victoria has a smaller number of drivers than New South Wales. Yet, if we look at driver fatalities, which I think is not only quite a
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> good measure of the seriousness of the problem but also helpful in comparing what is happening in the states, we find that over the 15-year period from 1980 to 1995 the number of fatalities in Victoria fell from 233 per year to 189 but in New South Wales over the same period the number of fatalities fell from 487 per year to 281. In other words, Victoria saw a drop of 19 per cent while New South Wales saw a drop of 42 per cent, yet at the same time Victoria has significantly increased its enforcement and particularly has stepped up the number of cameras and other forms of enforcement, particularly for speeding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Victoria, from 1990 until recently the number of speed cameras has increased from just four to more than 60&mdash;and that is only the number of speed cameras. The number of other enforcement methods such as radar guns and so on runs well into the hundreds. So I raise a very serious question here: is this focus on enforcement about trying to reduce the statistics or is it indeed about other things such as revenue? Given the comparison between Victoria and New South Wales, there is the very distinct possibility that revenue is playing an increasing role in this decision to step up enforcement. It is time that these questions were raised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One could go on and raise further questions. In relation to road safety I have mentioned roads and driver education. Other questions could be raised such as: why is it equally safe to travel at 100 kilometres an hour on an open road in a FJ Holden as it is in the latest Commodore, which has radial tyres, air bags, anti-lock disk brakes, progressively crumpling body on impact, quartz&hyphen;iodide lights and so on? These are all measures of a vastly superior motor car, yet far less superior ones can travel legally at the same speed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Road accidents, as I have said, are a major concern to Australia. But it is time to seriously question the emphasis on enforcement and, dare I say it, on revenue. I think we ought to be looking at other issues as well, such as what better roads mean. Statistics show that better roads are safer roads. For example, widening traffic lanes by just a metre reduces head&hyphen;on and run-off crashes by 20 per cent, passing lanes can cut crashes by as much as
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6043"> 50 per cent and replacing an undivided road with a freeway reduces the incidence of crashes by 90 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point to look at is driver education, given that 95 per cent of all accidents are due to driver error. I think when we look at all these issues a rational approach to road safety has to be a better approach. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="6043"><TITLE>Felix, Mrs Ruth: Treatment by Commonwealth Bank

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this grievance debate to express my concerns about the treatment by the Commonwealth Bank of a constituent of Greenway, Mrs Ruth Felix, who is 68 years old. To put Mrs Felix's case, I quote from her solicitor's letter to the Commonwealth Bank dated 22 August 1997:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our client advises that on 28 March 1990 she attended at the Commonwealth Bank and was requested to sign a document. This document was not explained to her and, although she was aware that the document referred to her property at 69 Davis Road Blacktown, she was not informed that by signing the mortgage she was placing her property at risk.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">She understood that she was merely signing a document that would assist her son in his business venture. Further, she was not advised to seek independent legal advice before she signed the document and she was therefore totally unaware of the consequences of signing the document.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In early 1994 Mr Brian Felix's business, Harmony Felix Pty Limited, failed and the bank required the loan repaid in full. Consequently Mr Brian Felix sold his home and the full net proceeds were paid to the bank. Mr Felix was declared bankrupt and the bank turned its attention to Mrs Susan Felix and Mrs Ruth Felix.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mrs Ruth Felix continued to pay as much as she could each month to the bank&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">in total, and these are my figures, she paid an amount of $24,000&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">but in May 1995 she was issued with a notice to vacate. Our client was very confused with the proceedings that were taking place and she placed her property on the market with a view to selling it and paying out the bank.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At this time the housing market was very slow and the bank did not afford her the courtesy of permitting time
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> for a sale to be negotiated. The locks on the house were replaced by the bank's own agent who was instructed to sell it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our client has not been advised in relation to the sale price, adjustments made at settlement, agents' commission or legal costs that may have been incurred. She did receive a letter stating that $95,194.48 from the sale of the property was applied to various loans but this would indicate that the house at 69 Davis Road Blacktown did not realise its market potential and was sold for a minimal amount.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I wrote to the Commonwealth Bank on 2 May 1997, outlining Mrs Felix's problem. My office received an acknowledgment letter dated 7 May and a faxed detailed reply on 19 June which included a response to Mrs Felix's solicitor faxed the same day, 19 June. I will now quote from the bank's letter to Mrs Felix's solicitor. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bank wrote to Mrs Felix on 12 March 1990 (copy enclosed for ease of reference) enclosing a mortgage document prepared for her signature in this letter and advising Mrs Felix to obtain appropriate legal advice or otherwise if she was at all uncertain of her position. Mrs Felix had on a number of occasions executed mortgages over the property. It would be difficult to concur with your claim that by signing the mortgage she was placing her property at risk.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mrs Felix&mdash;who was 61 at the time, is now 68 and continues to have to work&mdash;advised me that she did not receive this correspondence and the documents she signed on 28 March 1990 were in fact documents provided by the bank to her for the first time at the time of her signing. Mrs Felix also advised me that, contrary to the statement in the bank's letter, she has never had any previous executive mortgages over the property other than that which she took out to buy it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many matters still remain unresolved relating to this issue, but I raise the following points which go to the bank's ethical and professional dealings with its customers and may be issues worthy of government legislation at a later date. Firstly, there is the question of the ethical responsibility of the Commonwealth Bank accepting as a guarantor the family home of a 61-year-old widow who, in the event of an unsuccessful business  venture, would be unlikely to recover financially.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6044">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, there is the ethical responsibility of the Commonwealth Bank taking steps to sell Mrs Felix's home when she had returned to employment and was doing her best to repay the loan, having paid $24,000 off the loan as of 9 May 1994. Thirdly, there is the question of the ethical responsibility of accepting as guarantor two family homes&mdash;the mother's and the son's. In the event of a failed business venture, the family loses two homes. That issue raises a lot of questions and the Commonwealth Bank has to answer them, and fairly quickly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would now like to move on to another grievance that I would like to refer to tonight. This relates to another constituent of mine, Mr Terry Griffiths. Mr Griffiths is well known as the police officer who, in the course of his duty, was severely injured when a bomb exploded outside the Hilton Hotel at 12.40 a.m. on Monday, 13 February 1978, prior to the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. I am aware that a number of members, both past and present, have already spoken on this issue. They include the former Labor member for Macarthur, Mr Chris Haviland, the former member for North Sydney, Mr Ted Mack, and the present member for Warringah, Mr Tony Abbott.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Griffiths has recently approached me for support and I am very happy to provide that support. The facts conveyed to me by Mr Griffiths are that at about 12.40 a.m. on Monday, 13 February 1978, a massive bomb exploded in George Street outside the Hilton Hotel. As a result, two council workers were killed instantly and a police officer was mortally injured and died nine days later. Mr Griffiths was injured. A piece of shrapnel penetrated his side. He still carries that piece of shrapnel in his abdomen. Mr Griffiths also sustained a wound to the outside of his knee from a large piece of shrapnel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Griffiths advises me that on the evening of 12 February 1978 he commenced duty outside the Hilton Hotel shortly after 11 p.m. He noticed that the garbage bin on the edge of the footpath was overflowing with rubbish and comments were made about the bin being located right at the entrance to the hotel. At about 12.40 a.m. the next morning, a council
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> garbage truck stopped in front of the hotel. One man moved from the truck, picked up the bin and went to the rear of the vehicle. He tipped the bin upside down and a massive explosion occurred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since this period, Mr Griffiths has campaigned vigorously for a Commonwealth-state inquiry into the Hilton bombing. On 9 December 1991 a unanimous vote was carried in the New South Wales state parliament supporting a joint federal-state inquiry into the Hilton bombing. Mr Griffiths has on many occasions sought to put his views to the appropriate federal and state authorities and so far has been unsuccessful in getting the inquiry. In 1983 he wrote to the Royal Commission on Australia's Security and Intelligence Agencies, seeking permission to appear before it and put his views on the Hilton bombing. Mr Griffiths received a letter of acknowledgment, but was not called to appear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Griffiths also requested the New South Wales Premier and the royal commissioner inquiring into the New South Wales police force to place the Hilton bombing matter before the commission, without success. Mr Griffiths has said that he has been advised by Mr Hatton, the ex-Independent MP for the South Coast in the state parliament, that the commission's terms of reference were framed in such a way as to include matters like the Hilton bombing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Griffiths' theory is that the bomb that exploded outside the Hilton Hotel on the morning of 13 February 1978 was deliberately placed there to justify the existence of a counter-terrorist organisation in Australia. Mr Griffiths' theory is that a number of other government organisations were involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In view of the wide ranging support Mr Griffiths has received, and to test the views held by Mr Griffiths, I believe a joint Commonwealth-state inquiry into the bombing is justified. I hope the present government will agree to this course of action.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="6044"><TITLE>Local Government Funding</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For too long now, local government bodies in Queensland have been getting a raw deal over the Commonwealth government's overly simplistic distribution of general purpose funding to states. It grieves me to think that the Commonwealth Grants Commission completed a review in 1991 which clearly showed that Queensland was being severely disadvantaged under the current distribution system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Six years on, absolutely nothing has been done about it. Queensland has been fighting for a fair deal since the 1980s, when Labor was in power. It is with no great surprise that I report that they got nowhere. I have first-hand knowledge of the struggle, as I campaigned strongly for a fair deal when I was a councillor on the Belyando Shire Council. I say that it is now time to correct the wrongs of the past, to balance the scales and give Queensland local governments what they deserve: a fair deal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been proved that the current per capita system used to calculate the distribution of funds simply does not work. This system does not recognise the different needs of each state, nor does it recognise the individuality of local governments. States like Victoria, where the population is combined to a small geographic area, have thrived on this system. States like Queensland, where the population is spread over a large geographic area, have been severely disadvantaged. With the redistribution we will have shortly, Queensland will gain a seat and the ACT will lose a seat&mdash;an indicator that people are moving up to Queensland. It just goes to prove that Queensland should be getting more money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I give you one example of this unfairness: the distribution of moneys for roads. On a per capita basis, Queensland appears to have one of the highest levels of road expenditure. But these figures are deceiving. On a per kilometre basis, Queensland's expenditure is well below that of more densely populated areas. The result is that, under the current per capita system, Queensland can only dream of building and maintaining roads of a standard similar to that in more populated states. This is not for want of trying.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1995, Queensland local government allocated 31 per cent of its current outlays to road transport. This is well above the national average of 22 per cent. In my electorate of Capricornia, the condition and safety of roads is a major concern to the people I represent. Because of the remote nature of many of the communities in Capricornia, people have to frequently travel long distances to access services that people in metropolitan areas take for granted. Apart from roads, the remote nature of Queensland, coupled with its low population density, leaves the state severely disadvantaged in terms of receiving adequate funding to provide other basic services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Queensland has less than five persons per square kilometre, while states like Victoria have approximately 20 persons per square kilometre. This means that Queensland receives less money to provide the same services as other states over a larger geographic area. To confine these services to more densely populated areas like the state's south-east region is not a fair or viable option, especially in a decentralised state like Queensland. Take my own electorate, situated in central Queensland, as an example. This area is a thousand kilometres from Townsville, more than 600 kilometres from Brisbane, and over 2,000 kilometres from Canberra. There is no way people in my electorate can simply visit places like Brisbane and Townsville to access services people in more densely populated areas take for granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This has resulted in a situation where Queensland's local governments are having to allocate a larger proportion of their resources to provide basic services, and of course for infrastructure. This is being done at the cost of providing human services&mdash;human services which other councils have the luxury of providing simply because they are better resourced to meet a wide range of community needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another factor which is not taken into consideration is the diverse nature of communities that local governments in Queensland service. This is an important differentiation, as Queensland recognises the need of Aborigi nal communities to have their own system of local government. The Northern Territory is
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6046"> the only other state which recognises this need. What I find more alarming is that local governments in Queensland also have to provide a wider range of basic services compared to local governments in other states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Queensland, local governments are responsible for providing water supplies and sewage disposal. The provision of these two essential services by local governments is not universal and does not fall under the realm of local governments in all Australian states, whereas in Queensland it does. Queensland relies heavily on receiving funding from the Commonwealth to provide these essential services and others. Our revenue raising capabilities are severely restricted, as the population has lower average earnings and land value per capita is also lower than other states. Despite this, the population is rapidly growing and with it the need for more services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the situation is left unresolved, the needs of local governments in Queensland grow. It is time for a change and a fair deal. Distributing funds on a per capita basis is simply not working. Instead, it is severely disadvantaging states such as Queensland, while other states flourish. Let us not continue in Labor's footsteps. We need to stop treating states as though their needs and wants are identical. We need to review the current funding distribution method and make changes&mdash;changes which are long overdue. I repeat: it is time to balance the scales and offer Queensland's local governments a fair deal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another grievance I wish to raise is the fight by the Local Government Association of Queensland to secure a commitment from the federal Treasurer (Mr Costello) that federal company and sales tax will not apply to local government owned corporations. In 1996 the Treasurer ruled it out, and I am confident he will maintain this position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After spending 15 months approaching the government from all angles, the association feels the Treasurer has procrastinated on this matter for far too long. The association has now resorted to more drastic action and plans to embark on an advertising and direct mail campaign in the hope that the public pressure
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> will motivate the government to remedy the situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have already outlined the battles facing local government, especially in Queensland. So let us do something right. Let us show them that we understand their plight and grant them their simple request.</PARA>

I requested a contact point for my brother relating to a proposed Target store. He told me to get my brother to write to him. He subsequently did so. I never discussed the detail. I did not discuss any other matter with Mr Greiner.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the amendments be agreed to.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996 has been returned from the Senate with amendments. I am pleased to state that the bill passed through the other house on 17 June without significant amendment. The bill was amended in the Senate as a result of consultation and consideration by the government and proposals put by other parties. The government has always indicated that it would consider amending the bill when it was first introduced into this House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill implements the changes to the eligibility in the mining sector resulting from consultations with the mining industry. It also includes measures to improve administration and accountability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has decided not to proceed with defining beneficiation in an exhaustive way. Whether a process does or does not constitute beneficiation for the purpose of the diesel fuel rebate scheme will continue to be a matter decided on a case by case basis. In this connection, the government has decided that the meaning of beneficiation should be settled based on technical evidence in respect of the processes and should not involve market considerations that might affect the decision as to how the mineral or ore is processed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also contains an amendment to specifically negate the issue of rebate being paid for vehicles travelling on a public road
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in the mining operations category. Similarly, transport of people, goods and services by rail and sea are excluded. This amendment ensures that rebate is not paid on fuel used to propel any vehicle on a public road, even if the journeys undertaken by that vehicle can otherwise be characterised as integral to one of the activities listed in the relevant definition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In so doing, the government is confirming that the diesel fuel rebate scheme is a targeted scheme that is intended to pay rebate strictly in respect of those activities that form part of the definition of mining operations. Concerns have been expressed to the government that record keeping provisions in the bill could be construed as prescriptive, requiring the keeping of logbooks and operational records. This was never the government's intention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments to the diesel fuel record keeping obligation clarify the proposed requirement to keep diesel fuel records by removing any suggestion that particular types of records have to be kept. If an applicant for diesel fuel rebate has records which can substantiate the actual nature of the use of the fuel, those records will be sufficient for the purpose of the document retention obligation. The onus is on the user of the fuel to keep such records as are necessary to demonstrate that the actual use of the fuel was in an eligible category.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In concluding the debate, I would like to thank all of those members who had an input into this debate&mdash;a debate which started in December of last year in this House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not canvass the issues that the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser) raised when speaking on the amendments to the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996. It is sufficient to say that these matters were exhaustively canvassed in the Senate by Senator Cook, who had the carriage of the matter for the opposition in that place. This is a customs bill but, as the policy issues go to the minerals and resources industry, I have the carriage of it in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6056">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So far as specifics are concerned, I think it is worth while putting on the record in this place that the opposition is particularly distressed about the government's decisions, which it carried in the Senate by weight of numbers, in respect of 3&half; tonne vehicles, safety vessels for the servicing of offshore oil and petroleum rigs, limestone and the implications that has for the cement industry and also&mdash;one for the aficionados&mdash;the definition so far as place of mining is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was one victory in the Senate for the opposition and that was in respect of the rebate on the washing processes for salt. It was a victory achieved by the opposition for the salt export industry. There could not in very many respects be a better illustration as to how the policy matters that drive this area are better handled by an arm of government other than Customs. Salt is an important export industry and the rationale presented by Customs on the first occasion as to why the diesel fuel rebate ought to cease at the wet washing process was that salt put into that state was suitable for sale into the domestic swimming pool market. That ignores completely any notion of a salt export industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other than putting those things formally on the record and welcoming that modest little gain on behalf of the opposition, I might ask the minister: given that this bill was presented in the context of discussions with the industry, the higher level group, and understandings by the industry that the government would not subsequently impose a cap on the diesel fuel rebate scheme, what are the government's intentions in that respect and how did its meeting go with the representatives of the industry on Monday last week?</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Senate amendment No. 1 proposes a preamble be included which specifies the role of the convention and the appointment and election of delegates to the convention. The House of Representatives does not accept the amendment as it does not reflect the purpose and scope of the bill. Amendments Nos 2 to 8 and 11 to 68 focus on the method of voting for
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> half of the delegates to the Constitutional Convention, which will meet for 10 days in December 1997 to consider the question of whether or not Australia should become a republic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments require that voting in the election be by a compulsory attendance ballot which will make Australians who choose not to vote in the election for delegates liable to prosecution and add up to $20 million to the cost. The amendments also propose that the election be conducted along the lines of a Senate election. In light of the large number of candidates who could contest this election, possibly exceeding 200 to 300 candidates in New South Wales, a pure Senate style election would make it difficult for electors to vote for someone other than a large group and would extend the time needed to count the vote. Accordingly, the House of Representatives opposes these amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senate amendment No. 10 provides that a candidate's $500 nomination fee should be returned if the candidate is elected or if the candidate or candidate group receives at least four per cent of the total number of votes. Given that the government will be providing a tax deduction for election expenses up to a limit of $1,000 to candidates whether successful or not, the House of Representatives does not accept amendment No. 10.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We oppose the course of action being proposed by the government and support the amendments which have been successfully carried in the Senate. These amendments involve matters of very high principle as far as the operation of our democracy is concerned. These amendments go to reinstating for this most important of ballots the Australian secret ballot.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian secret ballot has two essential elements to it: one is its compulsory nature&mdash;it has been that way since the early 1920s&mdash;and the other is its secrecy. It is a ballot which is conducted free of anybody's purview other than that of the person casting the vote. It is essential that this be upheld because it has been a centrepiece of the avoidance of intimidation in our political system. It is a system so famous, so compre
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6061"> hensively successful, that it is one of the things that we are known for around the world: the fact that we stand for total secrecy in our ballots and that an Australian exercises his or her conscience with absolute freedom.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is being jettisoned by this convention. It is being jettisoned for bad motives. Those motives became much clearer earlier in the course of this session when we had a report from the relevant parliamentary committee with a recommendation which we know emanates from the man who is basically responsible for the carriage of this inside the government and in which he calls for an end to the compulsory vote.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are confident in pursuing this against that recommendation in the knowledge that this piece of Americanisation of the Australian political system is not supported by the Australian public. Indeed, the Morgan poll out today indicates that 68 per cent of people support the retention of a compulsory ballot and 29 per cent are in favour of voluntary voting. The figures for the two political parties are much the same. There is not a weighting in favour of Labor Party voters for maintaining a compulsory vote. Labor Party voters and Liberal Party voters are ad idem on this. This they regard as central to the operation of democracy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government is not being secretive in putting forward a set of propositions to test them ultimately for a fundamental change in Australia's democratic processes, if that is not its motive, then the other possible interpretation of why they are doing this is to be deprecated as well. That other interpretation as to why they are doing this obviously revolves around the seriousness with which they regard this convention. They want wriggle room. They want to be able to dismiss its outcome. They want to be able to question its representivity. They will have no problem questioning its representivity should the government's position on this with the propositions that they have put forward prevail. Irrespective of the turnout, even if 100 per cent of those who receive ballot papers do indeed vote, they will be able to test the representivity of it by reference to other factors.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Up to 3 million Australians may not receive their ballot papers because they have changed their address since the last election. Material on the ballot will only be available in writing and only in English, disenfranchising those who are blind, frail or aged, illiterate or whose English skills are not of a sufficiently high standard. A postal ballot provides greater opportunities for voters to be influenced by a strong- willed member of the family. This will sit for days on the kitchen table, vulnerable to anybody who decides to walk in, be it Uncle Bill or Aunt Maude or anyone with  more sinister intent as they go up and down the streets trying to put pressure on them to arrive at a particular conclusion. That is why we have secret ballots.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are the reasons, and there are others, why we are taking a strong stand in favour of Australia's traditional democracy as far as voting for this matter is concerned. This House would be well advised to support the Senate in this regard to re-establish, if nothing else, the bona fides of this government as far as its preparedness to protect the essential features of Australian democracy, are concerned. Your sleight-of-hand dismissal of the entirety of Australia's political history is to be deprecated and condemned and was opposed by the bulk of the Australian people when invited to express an opinion on it. You are bowdlerising the debate about our constitutional arrangements. Only the Labor Party can be trusted to put a proposition to the Australian people that gives them an opportunity to declare themselves on it. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Labor Party will be insisting on a compulsory election in relation to this convention. A compulsory vote is the only way to give credibility to this convention. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, Senator Minchin, is using this convention as a stalking horse to bring in non-compulsory voting. We will be insisting on a compulsory attendance ballot because we want to give credibility to the convention. The Parliamentary Secretary and the government want to turn the convention into a sham. That is why they are rejecting the amendments that the Senate, quite properly, insisted upon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6062">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A compulsory attendance ballot means that people can involve themselves&mdash;not two to three million people missing out on an important convention. We believe that there should have been an indicative plebiscite, but the government walked away from that. This is the next best thing. We want to give credibility to the convention. There is no credibility when two to three million people will miss out. I have here a sample ballot paper&mdash;and that is only the top half, not the bottom half, if you want to number every square. If you want to vote for a group vote you just put `1' in the square. It is a sham, and it is a deliberate sham.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Parliamentary Secretary is running around distorting the figures for a compulsory attendance ballot and a voluntary postal ballot. He says that the differential figure is $20 million. It is no such thing. A supplementary submission by the Australian Electoral Commission to the Senate committee showed that the difference was $13&half; million, and that was on the basis that the material would be put in an envelope this size&mdash;and this is less than half the ballot paper. So for a large envelope, the figures are doubled. You can add another $8 million. The difference is about $5 million between a compulsory attendance ballot and a voluntary postal ballot. It is value for money, because in a compulsory attendance ballot you will get a better turnout, you will get a scrutiny of people voting, you will have someone there present, independent, assisting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this sham is about, this voluntary postal ballot, is discrediting any attempt to move towards a republic. Senator Minchin's views are well-known. The views of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) are well-known. They want to use this voluntary postal ballot as an excuse to discredit the convention, to discredit the push towards a republic. If the Prime Minister had any decency about him and if the Parliamentary Secretary had any decency about him, they would be facilitating the process, they would be doing everything they could to get as many people as possible in the Australian electorate participating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But barrier after barrier is being put up to, in effect, depress the number of people
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> participating. One of the reasons this country has credibility and one of the reasons that the Australian Electoral Commission is being asked to go to other countries to show them how to do compulsory attendance ballots is the participation rate of some 96 per cent of people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) mentioned an opinion poll. The poll&hyphen;driven Prime Minister should listen to what the Morgan Gallup poll says. It says that there is little difference between Liberal and National Party voters and Labor supporters in relation  to the compulsory attendance ballot. Of the coalition voters responding to the survey, 68 per cent supported the retention of the compulsory ballot and 29 per cent were in favour of voluntary voting. For Labor voters, 70 per cent supported a compulsory ballot and 29 per cent were in favour of voluntary voting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The system works. It ain't broke. You do not have to fix it. The reason you want a voluntary postal vote is that you are trying to sabotage the move towards a republic. You are trying to discredit the convention. You are not fair dinkum. You are using weasel words. The Labor Party will push this when it comes back to the Senate. We will not walk away from compulsory voting. It is what gives us credibility.

As each day goes by, the Electoral Commission informs the government of yet another problem, yet another difficulty, associated with this. We are debating this in the parliament without the Electoral Commission being able to provide us with very many answers on how this will effectively and practically be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we actually look at what will have to be done&mdash;with the instruction booklet, with everybody's biography in it, and all the arguments associated with it, and then the interplay of that instruction book with that gigantic ballot that is completely incomprehensible&mdash;we begin to see why they are suspicious themselves. Instead of saying confidently, as they used to, that this will cost $20 million extra to do it this way rather than by an attendance ballot, they are now saying, `Well, up to $20 million.' Indeed, up to $20 million&mdash;it is about $16 million short of it. That is what it is about: up to $20 million but reaching about $4 million, if that, by the time this particular exercise has been gone through by them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The simple fact of the matter is this: it is perfectly legitimate to hold a view in this community that you would rather see the existing state of affairs persisted with. It is perfectly legitimate to hold a view in this community that you would rather something different. Both are entirely honourable positions and they ought to be argued sensibly and fairly. I actually happen to hold the view that the arrangements ought to change. While I do not regard this as the issue on which everybody will stand and fall in their lives, it is nevertheless important enough for Australian people to want to be able to exercise a sensible and effective choice, to have it taken out of the hands of politicians and to get an opportunity to express a view themselves.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a simple way of doing this. It is to ask them via a plebiscite: are you in favour of an Australian head of state&mdash;yes or no? If the answer is no, then you go back to the drawing board for a substantial period. If the answer is yes, then you move on. You do not create these extraordinary artificial structures&mdash;half appointed and half not appointed; the criteria for those who go for appointment. Who really knows what all that means? Is it weighted in a way that will give the government the outcome it wants? Are they going to be genuinely independent of any particular government preferences as far as that is concerned? Then you go to the elected end of the proposition, where we find the most  extraordinary distorted process that people are invited to go through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt whatsoever that the basis on which it is conducted will probably disenfranchise, irrespective of who chooses to turn up, some 3.2 million Australians. That is a bizarre outcome&mdash;a bizarre outcome by the standards of anybody who is genuinely committed to trying to find some level of representivity of public opinion in this process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is only one commonsense way, as I said, to go that is in keeping with the dignity of this proposition, and that is the way that we suggested some considerable time ago. There ought to be no embarrassment as far as the government is concerned in putting it forward. The government will suffer when this ultimately turns up on people's doorsteps.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For the edification of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), the simple fact is this: with this legislation having been treated in the Senate as it has been, if the government has any brains at all it would scrap the whole proposition. It seems that both sides of the House have been permeated by the pernicious doctrine of Keating which said the big issues in Australia were Mabo, the republic and the flag. As I told Keating and the caucus at that time, the big issues in this country are jobs, jobs and jobs. It is about time the Labor Party realised that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a nonsense concept that the government has put forward anyway. It has proposed a system of electing the convention. Clearly, that system will exclude an enormous number of people. The truth is this: in this craven House today the Labor Party talks about a republic, but many of its members are frightened, because they know their voters do not want it. On the other hand, there are only three people on the Liberal frontbench that can be relied upon to hold the line for the present system. I will name them for you: the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan), the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer). You could not guarantee anyone else on the Liberal frontbench to support the monarchy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What ought to be done in this case is quite simple. We ought to put the proposition in conjunction with the next election so that the people can vote on it. Having then got their result, if they decide they want to change, we can then go to a convention to decide on the form of the change and offer it to the people. That would be the logical way to do it. But the question should not be the weasel words as they are&mdash;`Do you want an Australian head of state?'&mdash;because quite clearly the Governor&hyphen;General is the head of state in this country and the position of Governor-General has been filled by an Australian many times. I
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> think it has been a long time since we have had a non-Australian Governor&hyphen;General. It is clearly a weasel way when you ask, `Do you want an Australian head of state?' Of course people do, and that is what they have got in our governors&hyphen;general.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How can anyone defy the logic of the sequence of events? We should ask the people whether they want to change. If the people of Australia say that they want a change on the basis of a constitutional referendum&mdash;and it must be on that basis; not with Sydney and Melbourne carrying sway over the whole of Australia&mdash;it is then the time to have a convention to offer the people the form of the change. To do it any other way is certainly a diminution of democracy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I hear the Leader of the Opposition talk about wanting democracy by having a vote on this, I wonder how in heaven's name are the people of Australia going to determine who is of any value in that convention&mdash;I certainly would not be able to and 95 per cent of the population would not be able to either.

Firstly, he is running an agenda here to, in effect, scuttle the convention, to discredit the convention. That is why he wants a non-compulsory postal ballot. Secondly, Senator Minchin has broken the convention of previous parliaments in relation to parliamentary secretaries sitting on committees of the parliament. My recollection is that, in the six years that members of the Labor government held the positions of parliamentary secretaries, the convention was that they did not sit on parliamentary committees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know now why he is on the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. He has another agenda, and he wants to use the

He is on the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters not to make the electoral system any better but to manipulate the electoral system to the benefit of the tories and the conservative parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So Senator Minchin is running two agendas here. That is what he is doing as a political operator. He is trying to use the convention as a stalking horse for non-compulsory voting, and it was inconvenient for him that the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters produced its majority recommendation last week for non-compulsory voting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Minchin should be put back in his place. The Australian electorate like compulsory voting. It is their opportunity to participate in the system. It gives them ownership of the system. It gives the system credibility. In recent elections the attendance has been 95 per cent or 96 per cent. It does not create disaffection in the community, like it does in Great Britain or the United States, where they resort to other activities because they do not come along and vote.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He is breaking the convention in terms of sitting on committees. Why? Because he wants to use the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters to pursue his narrow political objectives. He then wants to carry out his particular view of the world and of course the view of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), because in the end he is the agent of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is on the record as wanting, in effect, to scuttle the republic. He should not be doing that. As Prime Minister of this country, he should be showing leadership and allowing the people to be able to properly put their views. That is why the Labor Party insists on a compulsory attendance ballot&mdash;so that the system of voting, the method of voting, cannot be criticised and so that the convention cannot be brought into disrepute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister should show leadership on this issue. He should accept that the parliament, the other chamber, the minor parties and the Labor Party were successful in only one real thing, and that was having a
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> compulsory attendance ballot in relation to the convention. Why? Because it gives his convention some credibility. At the moment, if the government persists with this line, that convention will have no credibility and voters will be disenfranchised. The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) tells us that he wants a referendum on the GST. Is that going to be by a postal ballot that is non-compulsory as well? It is a farce. We have a system of voting. People accept it. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We in the Labor Party believe that this is a matter that should be insisted upon to give the convention some credibility. Allow the community their voice, Prime Minister. Senator Minchin has been going around misrepresenting the facts. There is more value for money in the cost of the convention vote in a com pulsory attendance ballot than in a voluntary postal ballot. It is a farce. There are going to be millions of ballot papers floating around this country. As the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) says, `Who is helping them?' It brings the system into disrepute, which is what they want.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The conservative Prime Minister and his prime minder, his parliamentary secretary, Senator Minchin, are about spearing the republic and discrediting the convention. They are about bringing in non-compulsory voting because they think that benefits the conservative forces. It is a disgrace.

Why would you knock off another $20 million and why can't it be voluntary if people have no interest whatsoever in an issue of this nature, which is not going to turn the nation on its head? After all, if we take the Keating minimalist position, we are arguing about calling Sir William Deane `Mr President' instead of `Your Excellency'. To tell you the truth, I
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> think $30 million is too much for that, but I am going along with it, along with my party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But can anybody suggest any reason that you people can stand up in this place and say that you have to have compulsory secret ballots, when your colleagues in the trade union movement, the ACTU and all of them, have been blockading Western Australia, conducting strikes, stopping the national productivity so that the tax revenue of this parliament is less so it cannot help the poor and needy?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You are doing all of that, and then you stand up in this place and give us the reverse argument. Make up your mind. Ring up Graham Kierath and say, `Minister for Labour Relations in Western Australia, we were wrong. We've changed our mind. You were right; secret ballots are good. Compulsory voting for all trade unionists is good.' But  make up your mind, because you cannot have it both ways. That is what you are trying to do tonight. You just cannot moralise on the issue when, in fact, you have been carrying on like a pork chop over in Western Australia, complaining about secret ballots being imposed by law&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I principally want to talk about the attempt by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Senator Minchin) to use this legislation as part of a series of moves to rort the Australian electoral system. But I cannot resist
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6067"> the opportunity to respond briefly to the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) in simply two ways. Firstly, he fundamentally misunderstands the situation in Western Australia. The objections of the trade union movement are not to secret ballots, but to the other matters that have been found by the ILO to be in breach of the freedom of association provisions of international conventions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What they are concerned about is that after 106 years of controlling the Legislative Council, because they have rorted the electoral system there every year for 106 years, the first time they lost, in the 1996 election, they dashed in to ram through the parliament of Western Australia industrial laws they did not outline before the election, before the impact of the decision of the voters came into effect on 22 May. That is what people were concerned about. That is why the trade unionists responded and it is why the opposition to electoral rorting is consistent and reflected in this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for O'Connor quite clearly said that the postal voting system is open to misuse and abuse. We all know it is. It is one of the reasons why we do not support this proposal and why we are insisting on the amendments.

Malcolm Mackerras pointed out, on the basis of some research that he had done, consistent with all the international experience, that moving from a compulsory to a voluntary voting system shifts the locus of political power two per cent to the right. It shifts the balance of electoral outcomes two per cent in favour of the right wing of a political spectrum. That is why Senator Minchin is seeking to do it. That is why it is a rort. In addition to the reasons proposed by the member for Banks (Mr Melham) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), these are the reasons we should, and will, insist on our amendments and oppose this rort.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The contribution of the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) was absolutely appalling. The member for Canberra (Mr McMullan) is quite right, the problems in Western Australia have nothing to do with secret ballots, although I must say that I do not think unions are that keen on secret ballots because they know that they inevitably lead to more determined strikes amongst their members, strikes which they feel they can usually organise or bring to an end much quicker. The history in Britain is that where secret ballots were imposed strikes among members became far more determined. It was a fairly gratuitous contribution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I implore the Labor Party to give this some thought. They know very well that their constituency overwhelmingly does not want a republic. So why don't they just sit back and let the Liberal Party do it. I can assure the Labor Party that the Liberal Party will  deliver them a republic within their next term of government. It is beyond doubt that when they win the next election they will deliver Australia a republic. You only have to talk to their craven backbenchers to know that that is the case. So if the Labor Party want to escape the wrath of their own constituents, they should just sit back and let the Liberals do it, as they have done in the past on these things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say again: there is absolutely no doubt that we do not want a plebiscite on this. We need a constitutional referendum on the question, `Do we want a republic?' When we have had that question asked, it will be time for us to look at what form it should take.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the amendments be disagreed to.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Senate has returned to the House of Representatives two amendments to the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Work for the Dole) Bill 1997. These amendments together insert into the legislation a sunset clause, which provides that the legislation will come to an end after two years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This initiative has been on the public agenda for some months now. It has been widely debated in the community since the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) announced it in February. It has been debated in the House
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and in the Senate and before a Senate references committee. I think it is fair to say that the Australian people clearly want this legislation. A two-year sunset clause can only lead to uncertainty and confusion. Amongst those mounting projects for work for the dole, it will cause confusion amongst unemployed participants in these projects and in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The communities have traditionally taken some time to establish the infrastructure for projects. While contracts will be signed as soon as possible, it is not at all certain when a particular project will commence. The imposition of a sunset clause removes the government's flexibility to accommodate good projects that require a longer lead time. The two-year sunset clause effectively gives the government and the communities, at most, in practice, about 18 months in which to establish projects and in which all decisions  con cerning participation in those projects are to be made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the consequences of this is that, in the last six months of any project, there could well be difficulties arising when members of a project wish to undertake employment and leave the project and have to be replaced by some other unemployed person. The short time frame will also make it difficult for communities to marshal community support for the unemployed participants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, the government's intention is that communities should offer continuing support for participants in the projects wherever possible beyond the conclusion of the project. The two&hyphen;year sunset clause again introduces a significant level of uncertainty into this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we know, the Labor Party has consistently opposed work for the dole. It has opposed it in the House on many occasions. Senator Faulkner announced in the Senate last Friday that the Labor Party would be moving a range of amendments to the legislation. Of course, what we have now seen is that the Labor Party has not had the fortitude or the backbone to stand by its position on work for the dole and, in the Senate today, the Labor Party capitulated on virtually every major
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6070"> element of the legislation. The Labor Party has been consistently out of touch on this matter with young unemployed people and with the wider community.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is quite clear that the community wants work for the dole. At long last, apparently, that message has begun to get through to the Labor Party but the Labor Party has still got to face up to the fact that it supported an amendment to this legislation, the sunset clause, which calls into question its acceptance of the principle of work for the dole. The Labor Party has not yet supported work for the dole. It is still in an ambiguous position on this very important principle. It is a principle which ought to be in the legislation and which the Australian people believe ought to be a permanent feature of the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the challenge is now before the Labor Party. Is it going to bite the bullet on this matter? Is it going to back down on this last amendment or is it prepared to stand by its former support of the sunset clause? I think the Australian people will be waiting to see whether the Labor Party's spine has finally collapsed on this matter. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As we indicated at the outset of these propositions, at the end of the day after we had made our points to the government on this mickey mouse proposition, we would pass it. Indeed, as I said on the John Laws show about three months ago, the stuff on work for the dole is a piece of political opportunism, a charade, in which the government is trying to cloud itself and its own inadequacy on the employment front. But
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> we will pass it. That is what I said at that point in time, and we will pass it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You are now left with, in work for the dole, a mickey mouse proposition. The public thinks it is five days a week. The public thinks that everybody who is unemployed&mdash;at least all young unemployed people&mdash;is going to be in a situation where they have to work for the dole. Anyone you go to as you go through your coffee mornings and all the rest of it assumes that there are a couple of hundred thousand places here&mdash;there are 10,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we have explained to the government before on this particular matter, the propositions we put in place when we were in office were a proper work for the dole scheme. It is interesting to see Tony Blair in the United Kingdom, firstly, sending out here a Channel 4 team to look at what he thought were the Labor Party propositions in this area, only to find that they had all disappeared. Secondly, he sat down with the Prime Minister and told the Prime Minister that it was the Labor Party's proposition that he was going to use to find 250,000 young people work in the United Kingdom.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Guess what happened? If you did not actually pick up the Labor Party's scheme under Working Nation, after you had been out of work for 18 months&mdash;and it did not matter who you were&mdash;you either accepted a training opportunity or you accepted one of those programs such as the land environment and action program or you accepted, on top of that, the jobskills program which became new work opportunity.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">And what happened to you if you did not accept one of those multiplicity of choices&mdash;training included in it, a pathway through to work? If you did not accept it, you lost your unemployment benefits. That is what happened. What was that supposed to be? What that was, of course, was a proper project. It was a project that actually created jobs, that actually got people into work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have got here is mickey mouse. We have got 10,000 mickey mouse propositions in which some poor group somewhere in the bush are going to be hauled out and they are going to be told, `You, you and you'. Nobody in Lane Cove is going to compulsorily work for the dole. Nobody is going to
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6071"> be singled out there. It is going to be in Wagga that those people are going to be subject to a compulsory proposition on work for the dole, and we are looking forward to watching your performance with this, minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You thought you were going to avoid an opportunity; that you would be deprived of an opportunity, over the next few months to actually have to implement this. Now you have to implement mickey mouse. Now you are in it. You are going to be implementing mickey mouse and you are going to stand or fall on what mickey mouse creates as far as those jobs are concerned and you are going to be deprived of the facade you have been using to conceal your failure on employment, a failure that is increasingly obvious to the Australian people. Not one job!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I look forward to your going to those workers in Newcastle who have been laid off as a result of your failure to deal with BHP. You are going to tell them that they are going to work for the dole. You are going to tell them that the in-principle position that you have arrived at is that they should work for the dole.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I oppose the amendments from the Senate. I think it is really quite pointless. Within two years the government is likely to be re&hyphen;elected and in that case they can very easily further it. If they are not, the opposition can do what it will with the legislation anyway. So it is really quite pointless.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do want to take up this accusation of mickey mouse projects. The truth is that the labour market programs of the previous
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government were mickey mouse as well. Unfortunately, most of the people never got out and saw what really happened. There were many people who got jobs because the employer was highly subsidised by government money. As soon as that money ran out, despite the fact that they had worked their butts off, people were thrown back on the unemployment. It was very demoralising. The problem is that they have taken as their model the CDEP, the community development and employment project, which is used in the Aboriginal communities. I know this scheme. It is overwhelmingly corrupt. If it is not properly managed, it becomes corrupt very quickly, and it is even worse than sit&hyphen;down money, straight dole money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government had any commitment instead of wanting to grandstand, it would have made sure that the administration of this work for the dole scheme was meaningful and was done through local government. It would have offered local government the same proposition that CDEP gets: the 15 per cent  on top for administration and equipment. That is how work for the dole could do some useful work. It is local government that is the nub of this, it is local government that knows the jobs in the community that need to be done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why didn't the government consider this? Because the government really wants to grandstand on it and wants to limit the scope of it. It is a great opportunity to get something constructive done in this country. It is a great opportunity to do some rebuilding of the infrastructure in the country destroyed by the years of Keating government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Recently I had the pleasure of attending an Institutional Investor Information Service workshop&mdash;the first of 40 to occur nationally&mdash;at the Industry Development Centre in Newcastle, with Michael Ronaldson, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp). The Commonwealth government's sponsorship of the IIIS is evidence of the Howard-Fischer government's commitment to engage private sector investment in regional Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite simply, it is a key part of the government's strategy to maximise the potential of regional Australia. It includes ensuring that regional communities have the support and services they need to build an environment where businesses have the flexibility, incentive and cost structure to invest and grow. The prime objectives are getting the economy working so that there are fewer constraints on sustained growth and, most importantly, providing a sound basis for development through better management of our natural resources and providing greater investment opportunities in regional Australia, and in particular the Hunter Valley, by addressing the causes of economic uncertainty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These objectives were reflected in Minister Sharp's statement <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Regional Australia: leading
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the way</EMPHASIS>, released in conjunction with the budget on 13 May. The importance that we place on the IIIS is evidenced by our financial support of $500,000, which is outstanding in these times of budget restraint. Our objective in establishing the IIIS is to bridge the information gap between institutional investors and regional project proponents; to act as a facilitator between private projects and private investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Without doubt, regional Australia is looking forward to heightened attention from predominantly Sydney and Melbourne based financiers who are looking for new markets, new projects: what has been missing is an improved understanding between the two camps. In taking the necessary steps to bridge this gap, the IIIS has established three central elements. The first element is a national register of investor ready projects, which provides a direct information conduit between proponents and institutional investors. The register will contain only projects which have been assessed by approved investment advisers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second element is an education campaign aimed at key decision makers within the institutional investor market&mdash;for example, fund managers, advisers, trustees, consultant actuaries and the banking industry&mdash;about the benefits of holding a more diversified investment portfolio and the investment opportunities that exist at the regional level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third element is a marketing-information awareness campaign to better explain to project proponents such as regional development organisations, local councils, public authorities, industry groups, developers and entrepreneurs how the institutional investor market works and what is required for project presentation and documentation, et cetera. Of course, this is what was detailed at the IIIS seminar for investors and project coordinators in the Hunter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Until the Howard government took office, the IIIS was being formulated without much input from state and territory governments. However, this has been corrected, and we now look forward to a significantly improved interface between the three spheres of govern
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6074"> ment and the private sector in the crucially important task of facilitating greater private investment in the economic infrastructure of Australia's regions. The recent announcement by BHP that it will close its Newcastle steel making operations in 1999 further underlines the importance of encouraging major investment projects in regional centres such as Newcastle and the broader Hunter Valley.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind the House that along with Minister Sharp, the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore), the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop), Parliamentary Secretary Ronaldson, and Senator Tierney, I met with community leaders on 19 May to get an understanding of their views on the way the Commonwealth can best assist the adjustment process. I have to advise the House that it was a very positive meeting. I was heartened by the optimism shown in particular by the support of Lord Mayor Greg Heys. I am excited by the potential of the Institutional Investor Information Service to increase the level of private sector investment in the Hunter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Projects showcased to the workshop were the Maitland transport hub, which was presented by Steve Edmonds, who is the Economic Development Manager of Maitland City Council. The project seeks to consolidate the facilities for Blue Ribbon Coaches and a major distribution business yet to be announced. The vineyards pipeline project, presented by Jennifer Roberts, from State and Regional Development, seeks to take water to the areas of the vineyards in the Hunter so that they may maximise the planting of vines, which has been restricted only by the lack of water for crop development. The Honeysuckle marina complex, presented by John Langley, who is the Senior Development Manager at Honeysuckle Development Corporation, would seek to provide berthing for 207 boats and, more particularly, develop a Fisherman's Wharf complex which would boost tourism attractions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The interest already shown in the IIIS, both by the investor community and in the Hunter, is extremely encouraging. I am sure that we will see the fruits of this labour sooner than
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> expected. The success of the seminar was due to the work of people like of Dr Allan Pattison of the HECD; Dennis O'Neil, the CEO of AusCID; Graham Timms, the Manager of Infrastructure Investment; and Andrew Petering, the Associate Vice-President of Equity Finance, CBA. The IIIS is a sensible innovative policy that is trying to foster visions for new investment and job creation in regional Australia. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="6074"><TITLE>Cyprus</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has been 23 years since the invasion of the island of Cyprus by its large and powerful neighbour, Turkey, in 1974 and the occupation of 37 per cent of the territory of that island by Turkey. It is 23 years since the people of Cyprus have been suffering and have been deprived of their basic fundamental human rights. Tonight I would like to raise my voice and express my wishes for the successful, speedy conclusion to the new process of direct negotiations that will start on 9 July in New York under the auspices of the UN. A solution to the Cyprus question could become possible only if all the countries of  the world, including Australia, press and persuade Turkey to show the positive political will which has been lacking for the past 23 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia has played a significant role in attempting to resolve the question of Cyprus. Australian governments over the years have raised the question at CHOGM meetings, at the UN and at Commonwealth meetings. Evidently, a just and viable solution to the Cyprus question can be achieved only if it secures a free, united, independent and sovereign Republic of Cyprus without the presence of Turkish troops and settlers and with the necessary and appropriate respect for the fundamental freedoms and human rights of all the people of Cyprus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to express my hope that the new process of the direct negotiations between the President of the Republic of Cyprus and the Turkish Cypriot leader, Mr Denktash, under the auspices of the UN Secretary&hyphen;General, Mr Kofi Annan, could lead to the solution that all of us have been looking for.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6075"> I believe it is time that the unfortunate Cypriot problem came to an end. With the appropriate pressure, I am sure it can. I expect that interested countries will show that they will do something.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia can do its bit by participating in the goodwill that the UN has engendered in this. We can make clear to the Americans and the Europeans that we support the initiative of President Clinton in appointing Mr Holbrooke as his special representative. He was very successful in bringing a solution to the troubled country of Bosnia, and I think that will give him a lot of experience in helping to resolve the question in Cyprus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, Australia has been involved in both trying to find a solution and participating on the ground. If under a new arrangement there is to be a peacekeeping force to assist in the transition to peace in Cyprus, I believe Australia should continue to be involved. We have played a very good role with the United Nations peacekeeping force with the involvement of the Australian Federal Police. In any new arrangement, Australia should see this problem through to its end. It would be unfortunate if the bureaucrats decided that any change now would be a way to withdraw the Australian Federal Police contingent, as has been put to successive governments over the years. We should stay involved and we should see it through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A second way that Australia could participate in helping to bring this problem to a solution would be to endeavour to engage the Commonwealth as an observer of the process. Cyprus is a member of the Commonwealth and the Commonwealth has played an active role in looking for a solution to the Cyprus problem. At the UN talks, there will be observers from the European Community, and there will be observers from the five permanent members of the Security Council. I think it would be very valuable for Australia to take up with the Commonwealth the question of the Commonwealth being an observer. I would encourage the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to make that call on the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia has a very large Cypriot community who have taken a very strong interest in what has happened in their homeland. Australia has responded to their call in the past, and I would hope that we would do so now at this most important time, probably the one chance there is before the turn of the century to resolve the question of Cyprus. All of us hope that we will not see 24 years or 25 years of the division of Cyprus between the Turkish north and the Greek south. Cypriots, be they Turks or Greeks, deserve the right to live in their homeland on their own. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="6075"><TITLE>Cabramatta: Heroin Addiction</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Over the years, I have experienced many sickening, heart moving and gut wrenching things&mdash;cot death, suicide, child rape and drug shooting galleries frequented by people who are almost dead. But I can tell you that nothing prepared me for what I saw when I went to Cabramatta last Friday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At 10.30 in the morning, in the car park behind the bottle shop where we were directed to park our car, only two hours after the morning clean&hyphen;up, discarded needles and sy ringes were already to be found. Mothers of young children, I was told, score across the road at the train station and use the car park to shoot up. So desperate are they and others who seek out the heroin trade that, I must say, it reminded me of attending the Flemington markets for a constituent last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the train pulls into the Cabramatta station, several dealers run from one side of the station to the other hoping to be the first to get to the prospective buyers. The footpaths carry amongst the usual litter of empty cigarette packets, lolly papers and so on, a lot of packages from discarded syringes and remnants of balloons in which heroin is usually packaged for sale.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some 50 metres from the end of the station walkway are the public toilets. A young teenager and his mate were shooting up not so much in the toilet but in the foyer entrance to it and the second one had trouble finding a vein. The first one was asked, `Where are you from?' and he said, `Cronulla.' I said, `If
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6076"> there was a place where you could inject yourself&mdash;not in a public place such as this but a place that was safe and perhaps supervised&mdash;how would you feel about that?' And he said, `Yeah, that'd be good.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A few minutes away from the station on a side street, a young woman was pushing a baby, possibly 18 months of age, along in a pram. After two deals, which certainly we observed, of her selling heroin to other people, she then injected herself. Crouched at the other end of the street, possibly 60 to 70 metres away from us, was another woman who was crouched injecting herself, presumably with heroin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Forced to close for safety reasons, the child-care centre's high wall conceals what says it all. When we looked over the wall of the child-care centre, we found a train ticket to Cabramatta, a spoon, a needle and a syringe, a fit pack and an empty swab packet where somebody had just shot up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The needle exchange counter, which is at the front of one of the largest pharmacies in Cabramatta, has a stall specifically for needle exchange. It was like a hot dog stand. The staff were very busy. In fact, they were flat out doing needle exchanges. It was rather interesting to observe the sorts of people who were going in to exchange their needles. They were not all young people. They were not all clearly itinerant or lower socio&hyphen;economic people. At the back of the pharmacy, we were shown five very large 30 litre or 40 litre containers for sharp disposals. I asked the pharmacist, `How many weeks worth is this?' and I was told it was two days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Overworked and overwhelmed, as you could imagine, the policemen, who do an excellent job there, were telling us that they do arrest people whom they see dealing in heroin and doing other illegal things, of course. But, every time they arrest somebody who is dealing, a policeman then has to spend three hours off the streets processing the arrest and by the end of the day the person who has been arrested is back on the streets dealing with heroin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Drugs are available all over Sydney and unfortunately they are available, indeed, all
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> over Australia. If people think that Cabramatta is a long way from an electorate like mine, which is a relatively privileged area of Sydney on the Upper North Shore, they need to ask themselves how long it would take for one of their children to catch a train from Pymble, Gordon, St Ives or anywhere else up our way over to Cabramatta.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would urge members of this House, when considering travelling arrangements, to perhaps take even half a day to go out and have a look at the problem. Australia may be doing its best in terms of the drug issue, but I think we all have to ask ourselves: is it good enough?</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="6076"><TITLE>Western Australian Police Force</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Over the last couple of months, much has been made in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS>  newspaper about calls for a royal commission into the Western Australian police force. As the representative for the seat of Kalgoorlie, which takes in 92 per cent of Western Australia, I have a lot of contact with the police, and I can say that overwhelmingly they are an excellent body of men and women.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly in remote areas, there is no public service better regarded by Aboriginal people  than the police. This is because it is the police who actually do things for communities and provide them with support. Often they are the only people to provide any sort of respite, especially where communities are afflicted by substance abuse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is in general no widespread corruption. Where it exists, it is overwhelmingly in association with drugs. This will not change until we make sensible laws in respect of drugs and eliminate the huge profits that go to big operators, who are rarely apprehended and, in all probability, are not even known.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have personal knowledge of families who have been traumatised by the actions and demands of their drug addicted children, and my heart goes out to them. However, it is the social disruption, crime and corruption that they inflict on society that must be stopped. To do this is straightforward&mdash;all addicts should be registered and offered treatment or access to drugs of a known strength and
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6077"> purity which are provided on prescription at a price designed to cover costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time as their market shrinks, we should legislate to increase the penalties for supplying or financing, and any person who commits a crime under the influence of drugs should be subjected to cold-turkey treatment. This is not fatal but is unpleasant and should reduce re&hyphen;offending.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is with great regret that I notice Mr Ayton, the ex&hyphen;deputy commissioner, re-entering the fray and calling for a royal commission. Mr Ayton is clearly trying to embarrass Commissioner Falconer, a man for whom I hold no great enthusiasm but one who did eventually face up to the enormous damage that Mr Ayton caused to morale in the police force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should be remembered that Les Ayton, for reasons best known to then Commissioner Bull, was plucked from the ranks and given special promotion through the ranks. He used his enormous power to promote himself and to further the careers of his chosen ones, often at the expense of thoroughly decent, hardworking officers. Mr Ayton and his friend, the DPP, should realise that it is just as corrupt to abuse their power and prosecute people with no real evidence as it is to take money. If Mr Ayton is to be given any credence, the question must be asked as to what he did when he had virtually unlimited power in the police force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mark Nevill&mdash;a member of the upper house in the WA parliament and the member representing the mining and pastoral region in WA&mdash;has had a question on notice for over two years that the police refuse to answer about what is best described as the Brennan Rolls Royce stolen car racket, where stolen cars were used to transport amphetamines and heroin between Perth and Sydney. The royal commission in New South Wales exposed how their vehicles were met and directed by police at the New South Wales end.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is over four years since Ayton, the official corruption commissioner and the DPP were appraised of this but nothing was done. Detective Ian Brandis was one of the lucky police officers under the patronage of Mr Ayton, and he was involved in some way with
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this racket, as implicated by statutory declarations made by Mr Brennan. Nothing was done, but detective Brandis was promoted to a position in the Bureau of Criminal Intelligence and would have been privy to confidential intelligence reports from other police forces. There is no doubt that Mr Ayton, the DPP and the director of the official corruption commission failed to take any action. `Why?' must be the question asked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another officer who had Mr Ayton's patronage was Superintendent Chilvers. He was able to resign recently with an honourable record despite many unanswered questions, some of which go to the baseless prosecution of other officers. One of Ayton's reports was described by E.F. Nelson QC in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report of the inquiry into matters relating to the establishment and operation of the Adelaide Casino</EMPHASIS> in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is riddled with hearsay, gossip, unsupported innuendo, selective comments, culturally impoverished personal observations of other countries and wide ranging conclusions based on the above matters. I have no doubt that Mr Ayton unfortunately is a man with a very strong degree of racial prejudice.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This document should be mandatory reading for anyone wishing to understand Mr Ayton and what went wrong with the WA police force. I suspect it was people of this ilk whom the American poet Ellen Wheeler Wilcox had in mind when she penned the memorable lines:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">distrust the man who tells you to distrust</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">for he takes the measure of his own small worth</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and thinks the world no larger.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I have little faith in royal commissions in Western Australia. Of recent times, they have been political witch hunts. I do not think an inquiry into the police force is justified unless there is a thorough inquiry into the administration of justice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Allegations of tampering with court records, the obliteration of transcripts, the failure to put forward exculpatory evidence and a very selective treatment of perjury charges are but the tip of the iceberg. Stop the drug money and you will stop 75 per cent of the corruption. We have the means to do it&mdash;all we lack is the will.</PARA>

Last weekend I attended the 49th annual dinner and presentation night for the Point lookout Surf Lifesaving Club, and I must say I continue to be impressed with this club, its members and its history. Its development of training of surf lifesaving techniques has exceeded all previous records for individuals in hours spent on patrol, with the number of bronze medallion recipients for this year being 35.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those of you who do not know, North Stradbroke Island is, I am delighted to say, in my electorate of Bowman in magnificent Moreton Bay. It has three main townships&mdash;Dunwich, Amity Point and Point Lookout, the latter being on the open side of the island attracting the majority of beach goers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The island has a permanent population of around 3,000. However, this can swell to over 50,000 during school holidays. Thankfully, we have the men and women, boys and girls, of the Point Lookout Surf Lifesaving Club to keep a watchful eye. In fact, they do such a tremendous job there has never been a life lost on a patrolled beach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The club, which consists of 500 members&mdash;120 of whom are active&mdash;patrols two beaches every weekend, Main and Cylinder. On public holidays and during other holiday periods, the club extends its services to a third beach, Flinders. The club also assists with patrols at the Broadbeach Club on the Gold Coast due to a fall in volunteers in that area. This is the only surf lifesaving club in Australia that patrols three beaches.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The club's membership base is diverse, with the youngest members being seven years of age and the oldest in their 60s. There is a wealth of young talent coming up through the ranks, with one of the largest nipper clubs in Queensland based on the island. Every weekend during the season, the nippers travel to the island for a variety of activities and training.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another of the fascinating aspects of the Point Lookout club is that the majority of members live on the mainland and have to travel to the island on the barge or ferry. Yet every weekend throughout the season, the bunkhouse is full, with up to 40 members giving their time to the club.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But do not think they are part-time lifesavers. This club has a very proud record in competition. The club's under 18 first aid team of Lisa McMahon and Adrienne L'Barrow are the current Australian gold medal champions and, in the patrol competition at the last national titles, the club's team took the bronze medal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This coming weekend the club's IRB rescue team, the ones who drive the rubber inflatable rescue boats, will compete in the national titles in Perth. The club is ranked second in Australia, and I take this opportunity tonight to wish them all the best for this weekend. Point Lookout also has a great band of workers behind the scenes, with the current club secretary, Natasha Dennis, being named Queensland Volunteer of the Year in Surf Lifesaving.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said earlier, I was fortunate to be present at the club's annual dinner recently for the presentation of club awards. My congratulations go to the open club champion, Troy Wright, and to the joint winners of the club esteem award, Grant Mills and Matthew Stevenson.

As has been pointed out, there will be UN convened talks in New York from 9 July, and this represents a significant step forward. It represents a step forward which has been a long time coming. Since the occupation of the northern part of Cyprus on 20 July 1974, we have seen 23 years of a divided island. Indeed, the northern part of that island is the most militarised piece of earth in the world. Thirty&hyphen;seven per cent of the island has been occupied. It is divided down the middle with the now infamous demilitarised zone which was the site of a number of killings of Cypriot citizens last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The appointment by the United States President, Bill Clinton, of Richard Holbrooke as the presidential emissary for Cyprus also represents a significant step forward. I know that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) raised the question of Cyprus with the US President during his visit to Australia. Many people, certainly on the Labor Party side, and also many on the other side of the House, have had a principled position with regard to the Cypriot question in ensuring that a resolution provides real security for both Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The conference at the United Nations will be attended by President Clerides of Cyprus and Mr Rauf Denktash, representing Turkish interests. I think that any solution will have a number of components. Firstly, the proposal
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> put forward by President Clerides of a demilitarisation of the island has to be an important step forward. Whilst outside forces and, indeed, internal military forces of such a number exist, it is hard to perceive how peace and security can be advanced. Secondly, to back that up it will need an international peacekeeping force sponsored by the United Nations to ensure that, during the transitional period to a united Cyprus once again, there is genuine peace and security on the island. Thirdly, the right of intervention of the guarantor powers should be abolished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that any solution must be along the lines of United Nations resolution 939 of 1994. It must provide for a federal, bi&hyphen;communal Cyprus, not one which is divided into two states. Australia has a particular obligation&mdash;and I would urge the federal government to consider participating in an observer status role in these discussions&mdash;not just because of the large numbers of both Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot people who have now made their home in Australia, not just because we have played a role from the very beginning in the United Nations peacekeeping force there and because there are still Australian Federal Police officers there but, most importantly, because Australia represents a successful multi&hyphen;ethnic state itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why is it the case that, in my suburb of Marrickville, where the Cyprus Community Club is situated, people of Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot origin not only get on, but are friends and live in a harmonious fashion? Australia's history and our federal system of government could provide many lessons as a multicultural success story, most importantly in terms of the sort of society which we have. We have built upon respect and tolerance for each other, which is a very useful role model for Cyprus as Cyprus moves along, hopefully before the end of the century, to once again being a united country.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="6079"><TITLE>Schools: Performance Scores</TITLE>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For a number of years the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS> and other media had been publishing OP or similar scores, based on information provided under the freedom of information acts of the Queensland parliament. In 1995, the then Labor government amended the law to stop the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS> from doing this. The Goss government claimed that publication would lead to unfair competition among schools. It ought to be noted that in other states this information is available and, of course, the availability of that information assists parents and others in the community to look at various schools with respect to their performances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important that the Queensland government recognises that this is 1997 and that parents are entitled to have this information as they come to choose a secondary school for their children. It is absolutely vital for them to take into account the relative levels of academic performance of various schools along with other information when determining which is the right school for their children. The current suppression of the data necessary to enable publication of OP results is effectively censorship, and this is not in accord with the openness and accountability that the community expects at this time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The failure to publish this information amounts to censorship and enables non-performing schools to hide and encourage mediocrity. It ought to be noted that a number of very prominent people have differed from the actions of the Queensland government. Mr Justice Paul de Jersey of the Queensland Supreme Court said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The educationalists seem to be saying that OP results are solely a measure of individual performance and that you cannot draw conclusions about how schools are progressing from these individual results. The answer to that is simple. Schools develop individual talent so OP scores do reflect the role of the school in maintaining and developing individual talent. The educationalists' argument is an absolute furphy.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He went on to say that he sees `no valid reason for withholding it, particularly in these days of accountability and consumer oriented value&hyphen;for&hyphen;money analysis'. Justice de Jersey said that it was `grossly patronising of the education establishment to say that citizens could not have OP information because they would probably misuse it'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It ought to be noted also that Mr Doug Tucker, a senior lecturer in public administration at Queensland University, said that many parents were prepared to make substantial sacrifices for their children and should be able to get OP information. He said he was `sickened when he saw statements by high school principals that academic achievement was not the only thing relevant with respect to education.' `This is preposterous', he said. `It should be up to the parents. If they want to value these other things, well and good, but some parents realise their youngsters' whole future may depend on getting into university. Parents should have the freedom to make up their own minds.' The editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> of 13 January 1997 is relevant:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is censorship, and it has no place in democracy. Taxpayers have an investment in the education system and have a right to access how public money is being spent. . . Releasing data such as OP scores makes schools and the education department more accountable . . .</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The secrecy about OP scores and league tables simply suggests that teachers, school administrators and education bureaucrats have something to hide. If not, let them prove it by releasing this data for public scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Many people throughout Queensland pleaded with the former Labor government to allow the publication of this information. It is only fair and reasonable that parents and others in the community are able to assess the relative academic performance of various schools. To suppress this information, to prevent Queensland parents from having this information, is totally unacceptable in 1997. The former Labor government stands condemned, and I would call upon the current coalition government to reverse the retrograde action of its predecessor and once again allow the availability of this information so that Queensland parents are able to make a considered judgment on exactly where to send their children to school.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, let me add my voice to the words of the member for Watson (Mr McLeay) and the member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese) in relation to the hope, as mentioned by the Foreign Minister (Mr Downer) today, that we can all work towards some peace in Cyprus, towards achieving a solution to a problem which should never have been created in the first place and which has lasted for too many years. This solution is one which I personally, being the only MP born in Cyprus who serves in a parliament outside of Cyprus, have longed for. The member for Grayndler also mentioned that people from Greek and Turkish backgrounds are working and living together in Australia under our multicultural banner. This is so especially in my electorate. It is a very good example of what can happen, in regard to the resolution of that crisis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did, however, want to mention a matter that I referred to last week in the grievance debate, which is a retrograde step in relation to multiculturalism. I refer to the dismissal by the minister responsible in the Kennett government of the Darebin City Council; Darebin City is part of Melbourne, which  is a very multicultural city. The council was composed of people from a variety of ethnic backgrounds. Five out of the nine councillors were from non-English speaking, or migrant, backgrounds. They were all working together to try to achieve good results for that city.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Interestingly, the mayor, who had been elected only two months ago, Nazih El Asmar, was the first mayor of Lebanese background in Victoria. It was therefore a precipitate and outrageous action on the part of the Kennett government to dismiss this council, even though the report which they themselves commissioned in relation to the council on events that began before Mr El Asmar became mayor, did not say: `Dismiss the council.' It said: `Appoint a mediator to mediate between the council and the government and the chief executive officer and achieve some result.'</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister did not follow that result, and in so doing he ended up dismissing a council because it was solidly Labor&mdash;he did not like that&mdash;and because it was of such tremendous ethnic character. This has created a tragedy in terms of the message about multiculturalism that has gone out in Melbourne. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday in Melbourne the Lebanese community hit back with a meeting of nearly 200 people of Lebanese background condemning this action, saying: `What is this? The first time that one of our people has managed to become a mayor, you go and dismiss this man on this pretext. You do not even give this man a go. You do not give our community a go. You do not give the ethnic communities a go.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister should stand condemned for this action. When I raised this last week he said: `This is not a serious matter.' It is a serious matter, and it will continue to be considered and debated until the minister restores the council and the mayor.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> apprenticeship services or Contracted Entry Level Training Agencies (CELTAs). The project will comprise eighteen case studies of all demonstration projects across Australia. This brief informs prospective contractors of the requirements of the project to enable them to submit a detailed and costed proposal to the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (DEETYA).
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6089"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2 GENERAL BACKGROUND</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.1 Introduction</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government is in the process of introducing major changes to labour market assistance in Australia. The primary objective of the Government's reforms is to ensure that labour market assistance has a clear focus on real job outcomes and genuinely makes a difference to those assisted. To do this the government is introducing a competitive employment services market, a new range of services for job seekers and employers and a single point of contact for apprenticeships and traineeships.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">CELTAs in the form of Entry Level Training Support Services (ELTSS) will be set up as part of the plan for changed delivery of government assistance. They are one of the five key services to be developed under the employment services market. They will provide a one stop service for employers and potential trainees, ie. an integrated service delivery to overcome the difficulties employers and prospective apprentices and trainees face in having to deal with several layers of bureaucracy to access training support services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Commonwealth, State and Territory Ministers agreed to the conduct of a number of CELTA demonstration projects in the lead up to full implementation of the ELTSS from 1 December 1997. DEETYA asked all States and Territories to put forward demonstration projects that would test the issues associated with combining Commonwealth and State ELT functions into a one stop service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The $8.3 million demonstration project network is a joint initiative of the Commonwealth, State and Territory governments. The Commonwealth government has provided $5.2 million for the projects, the State and Territory governments have provided $3.1 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Industry will also play a major role in managing the services to meet the needs of business, apprentices and trainees. Many of the projects will be run by industry groups including Multiplex, Retail Traders Association, Australian Business Ltd., Metal Trades Industry Association and Email. The projects will therefore combine the efforts and expertise of industry groups, employers, Chambers of Commerce and the State/Territory training authorities. These groups will be need to be included in the case studies.</PARA>

Traineeships were expanded in 1982 when the pilot phase of the Australian Vocational Training System (AVTS) began.

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6096">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) I am aware of the article you refer to. The article has made a number of inaccurate allegations about Australia's policy on the issue of East Timor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would note that the key aspects of the Government's policy towards East Timor are:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> de jure recognition of Indonesian sovereignty over the territory</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> disapproval of the way Indonesia incorporated East Timor into Indonesia</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our approach has been a constructive and results&hyphen;oriented one. We have chosen to work with the Indonesian authorities, urging them to take steps to improve the situation in East Timor. The Government will not be prescriptive about what Indonesia should do, but we have noted several aspects of the currently unsatisfactory situation that could be addressed, including:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the excessive military presence</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the lack of employment opportunities for East Timorese (especially the young) in the regional government and the private sector</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) No. The allegation that Departmental officials advised journalists not to cover the issue of East Timor is false. Officials visited Darwin in January 1993 to brief Australia Television staff, at their request, on the subject of South East Asia. At no stage did these officials advise journalists not to cover the issue of East Timor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The allegations in the article regarding Australia's relations with the ICRC in Indonesia are inaccurate and mischievous. The Australian Government has actively supported the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) operations in East Timor, providing contributions totalling $4.9 million since 1982&hyphen;3. In 1996 the Government provided a further grant of $300,000 to support the ICRC's activities in East Timor, and has indicated its willingness to consider further contributions to its operations in future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">AusAID funds are also used in the continuation of the joint ICRC/Indonesian Red Cross (PMI) water and sanitation program and public health project. This program is now in its fifth year and aims to improve the health conditions of people living in remote villages in East Timor, providing them with basic knowledge of hygiene and prevention of diseases.
