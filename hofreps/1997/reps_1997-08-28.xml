<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Speaker, this bill facilitates implementation of the significant changes in the delivery of child care payments contained in the Child Care Payments Bill. It introduces a number of transitional arrangements which ensure the smooth introduction of the new payment arrangements for families and child care providers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In particular, it ensures that children currently using the long day care sector to provide outside school hours care for their children are not disadvantaged by the introduction of the new school child rate of child care assistance. It also provides exemptions from the planning framework for child care operators who had taken action to build or extend a child care centre before the planning limits were announced on budget night.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill provides for the repeal of the Child Care Rebate Act 1993 and provides for 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> amendments to various other acts which are necessary to implement the new payment arrangements. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That regulations 11 and 12 of the AUSTUDY Regulations (Amendment) as contained in Statutory Rules 1997, No. 83, made under the Student and Youth Assistance Act 1973, be disallowed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This measure, announced in the 1996&hyphen;97 budget, reduces by a third the maximum rent assistance available to single students without dependants who share accommodation as of 1 July this year. It is in line with the same measures affecting people who receive rent assistance through the Department of Social Security, which cut rent assistance payments to some 80,000 Australians. This is the final change to Austudy from the range of measures, all negative, which were announced in last year's budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the time of this announcement this measure would have saved the government some $700,000 over four years. However, with the recent announcement of the introduction of a youth allowance, which will extend rent assistance to a far broader range of students than is presently the case, the reduction of the maximum amount payable to singles in shared accommodation becomes far more significant in terms of the number of people who will be affected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently, to receive Austudy rent assistance you need to be in one of the following categories: you are homeless; your parents are unable to provide a home, care or support for you; you are an orphan; you are a refugee 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7222"> with no parents in Australia; or you are in state care getting the away from home rate and living away from your foster carer's home. In other words, the people we are talking about who are affected by this disallowance motion and in terms of the measure's immediate effect are facing severe disadvantages. It cannot be said that any of these categories represent those who are at all financially advantaged in our society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Austudy is designed to help people complete their education for their own benefit and for the benefit of our society generally. People receiving rent assistance are the perfect example of those for whom Austudy was designed. In many cases, in order to have reasonable access to university or TAFE, students would find it necessary to live in inner&hyphen;city, high rent areas and to share accommodation to reduce costs. This government has decided to penalise them for that decision, which is related to the advancement of their education. It has reduced the weekly rate of rent assistance for such people from $37.30 to $24.90.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In order to access such assistance, a student needs to be paying a certain amount of rent&mdash;a threshold&mdash;before that student can receive any assistance. Above that threshold, three&hyphen;quarters of what is paid by way of rent is then paid to the student in the form of rent assistance, subject to a ceiling. So we are not talking about some sort of windfall gain to people who might not need it; we are talking about people who are desperately in need and who are actually paying out more than the threshold level of rent. This measure, now subject to disallowance, has immediately affected around 2,600 people. It is likely that some of these will find it too difficult to continue their studies. The advancement through the education system of more than 2,500 young Australians affected by this measure is now in jeopardy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the commencement of the youth allowance on 1 July next year, some 70,000 full-time students, currently Austudy recipients, will be eligible for rent assistance. Of those who are single and living in shared accommodation, probably a significant proportion will suffer because of this change.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has said that the youth allowance is not a saving measure, although it has not released the full details of costings. Therefore, it is very difficult for the parliament to know the legitimacy of that claim. What we are talking about today, however, is a savings measure in advance: taking away an entitlement to maximum rent assistance before the rent assistance is provided. So there is the direct impact of 2,600 students being adversely affected by this measure and now, with the introduction of the youth allowance, the possible adverse impact on 70,000 full-time students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government claims that the youth allowance is designed to encourage young people to study. Yet last year's budget cut student assistance expenditure by $514 million over four years, representing a sustained attack on income support for students. This measure can take its place among the unjustified and mean-spirited changes to Austudy introduced by the Howard government. It can stand beside the abolition of case management of secondary students on the homeless rate of Austudy and Abstudy. It can stand behind the cessation of the schooling incidentals allowance for those same homeless students and the tightening of the actual means test, which Amanda Vanstone turned into an administrative nightmare. It can also stand behind the raising of the age of independence which, apart from being inequitable in itself, is impacting particularly unfairly on some students who, for technical reasons, are being considered dependent on their parents when they have, in reality, led independent lives for years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition is opposed to this particular measure and seeks its disallowance. We make the broader point that a government that is taking away over $&half; billion in assistance for income support for young Australians going through their studies is a government that does not value education. It is also a government that does not value security for young Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the public debate we are having a substantial discussion about the need for security&mdash;job security, income security, all forms of security&mdash;in this world of constant change 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7223"> and uncertainty. It should not be forgotten in that particular debate that there is a need for income support and security for young Australians. If, as a parliament and a nation, we are not providing certainty and security for young Australians, particularly in that important transition from school to post-secondly studies and beyond, then we are much diminished as a society. If we are not providing the sort of certainty that young Australians need to advance themselves and their studies, then the nation as a whole is much diminished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would urge the government in this great national debate about insecurity to take heed of the need for greater security for young Australians, particularly in student income support. If students do not have that security, if they do not have that adequate level of income support as they engage in their studies, then they take lower risk options in their studies and they take lower risk options in their career ambitions. A nation that is dropping its ambitions, dropping its horizons among its young students, is a nation that will be diminished in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the saddest thing about the whole raft of Vanstone changes to the education system. The damage might not necessarily be felt in 1997. But there is one certainty out of the debate: the damage will be felt supremely in decades from now. At that time, it will be too late to reverse this government's running down of security and opportunities for young Australians in their studies. The government needs to reverse a whole raft of Austudy changes and reductions in income support and security. It also needs to recognise that, in many other areas of its education funding cuts, reversal of policy needs to be implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Travelling around Australia's universities, I have observed that Austudy itself has become a matter of substantial controversy&mdash;not only in relation to the disallowance matter now before the parliament but the whole raft of changes, the whole raft of impacts arising from the half a billion dollar funding cut, particularly with the administration of the actual means test. I know that the parliamentary secretary&mdash;inadvertently promoted earlier on by the Speaker, in word if not deed, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and in recognition of relevant merit on the government frontbench&mdash;has had some responsibility for the actual means test. He too knows the difficulty. He knows the nightmare. He knows the horror of students, on average, having to wait 49 minutes on a so-called hotline just to have their queries answered.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="MACKLIN" NAMEID="PG6">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="K26">Mr LATHAM</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pretty cold hotline when they have to wait for 49 minutes&mdash;if they get through, as the member for Jagajaga points out. The 49 minutes was an average which was calculated off the number of students who got through. So, for all those who just gave it away in deep frustration, the statistics and the horror of this administrative nightmare would be much worse.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government needs to have a sound review of Austudy policy, not only in this matter but across the board. The Australian Labor Party in embracing new policies, particularly in the education area, is conducting a policy review. We are very determined to produce some changes to the Austudy arrangements by ways of providing greater certainty and security for young Australians. What we have with Austudy, basically, is the disease that so many parts of the welfare state in Australia have been inflicted with&mdash;the idea that additional issues and problems can only be addressed by another category, another set of means testing, another cut in and cut out point; running students, in this case, through five or six hoops of means and asset testing before they can become eligible for the Austudy arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These particular arrangements need to be simplified. There needs to be simplicity and flexibility in the sort of income support that is being provided to young Australians&mdash;the flexibility, the simplicity, the strength and the certainty of income support that ensures that students are not dropping their horizons, that they are not dropping their level of ambition and risk in the education sector; that they are taking the highest possible option for their own benefit and the benefit of the nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are hard issues for the opposition to advance because the government has a totally incorrect set of priorities. This is a govern 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7224"> ment that in its first and second budgets quarantined defence spending but made education, including Austudy, its No. 1 target for funding cuts. It is almost surreal in Australia at the current time, as people talk about security, as they talk about international engagement, to understand what we are doing in Australia by way of education funding cuts compared to the growth economies and nations of our region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Have a look at Singapore or Malaysia where there is no public debate as to whether or not education is a public or a private good. It is the Vanstone approach, of course, to say, `Well, look, there's a public benefit and there is a private benefit in education. Off the private benefit, we'll hang a user charge.' In our competitor nations there is no such debate because they recognise that in a post-industrial society, where there are new information based opportunities in the economy and in our society, education needs to be regarded as an essential national investment, as an essential national good, that does not find itself subject to this public versus private debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you invested in education as an essential national good, then years from now Australia would be reaping public and private benefit aplenty. That would be the sound set of policies that best serves Australia's national interest. What we have from this government is a very different set of priorities, quarantining all those defence golf courses and other parts of the defence establishment in Australia while making education the No. 1 target for funding cuts. The No. 1 targets are students, course work, universities, TAFE; all the opportunities that should be available for young Australians. This parliament and the government should be providing security for that transition from school to post&hyphen;secondary studies and then on to work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is but one part of a whole raft of problems that the government has created in the education area. The Labor Party has constantly opposed each of these changes. We are doing it again on this particular matter with the Austudy regulations. I certainly urge the parliament to support the disallowance motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) is a very clever politician; there is no doubt about that. That is why the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) is so scared of him. That is why the Leader of the Opposition kicked him upstairs when he took him away from being assistant shadow Treasurer and made him the shadow minister for education.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that the member for Werriwa has been far too clever by half today. What he is trying to suggest is that the government is taking away large amounts of rent assistance from 78,000 students. You cannot take something away from people which they never had. You cannot take something away from people which the former government never gave them. In all the 13 years of the former government's existence, it never gave students rent assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The important thing to remember in this debate is that this government is paying rent assistance to students for the first time. This is a very important innovation; a very important extension of the principles of social justice. Students now get rent assistance thanks to this government. Seventy thousand students will benefit because of this government's decision to extend rent assistance to students on Austudy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are paying rent assistance on the same basis as rent assistance is paid in the Department of Social Security. As we know and as the former government knows, people who are sharing accommodation receive that accommodation in effect at a lower unit cost. That is what the former government always acknowledged when it paid lower rates of rent assistance to married people under DSS. That is what we are doing with rent assistance now. That is what will happen with rent assistance as paid through Austudy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1996, 8,000 Austudy and Abstudy customers received rent assistance. Of these, only 19 per cent of Austudy rent assistance 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7225"> recipients and 18 per cent of Abstudy rent assistance recipients received maximum rent assistance. The average rates of fortnightly rent assistance paid to Austudy and Abstudy clients were $45.20 and $45.10 respectively. That is less than the new lower rate of rent assistance. This measure is estimated to affect only 1,300 Austudy and Abstudy clients receiving the student homeless rate in 1997, with savings of just $240,000 in 1997&hyphen;98 and the following year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The simple truth is that this is a good move for students. This is a major innovation for students. This is something which has been given by the government to students for the first time. One can understand why the member for Werriwa and the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) are so upset about it. We are doing something which, if the former government had had any heart, it would have done. This is something which the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, can be very proud of. This is something which the government is very proud of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the proposal of the member for Werriwa were accepted, we would be spending something like an extra $40 million. The youth allowance which the government is moving to in the middle of next year is not a savings measure. The total cost of the youth allowance will be $25 million more than the total cost of the measures that it replaces. So it is not a savings measure, it is an innovation; it is social reform. If we were to do what the member for Werriwa suggests we should do, we would spend an additional $40 million on student beneficiaries of youth allowance alone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Werriwa has developed an enormous penchant for spending money over the last couple of months since he has become the shadow minister for education&mdash;$40 million extra on rent assistance; if we were to abolish the increases in HECS, I am advised that would cost $257 million up to the year 2001 on a headline basis and $1.449 billion on an underlying basis. The member for Werriwa has become a very expensive addition to the front bench. I wonder whether he has discussed any of these proposals with the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> shadow Treasurer, that policy genius as he was described in a Glenn Milne column recently before the young and the restless came out and undermined that briefing which had been given by the shadow Treasurer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that the member for Werriwa is costing the shadow Treasurer an enormous amount of money&mdash;$40 million with this measure alone, $257 million in the removal of the HECS increases and almost $1.5 billion in underlying increases. This is the kind of money that the member for Werriwa wants to cost the shadow Treasurer. It is quite unusual to suddenly see the member for Werriwa reborn as Santa Clause, because in his former incarnation he was always Uncle Scrooge. If you look at the record of the member for Werriwa, you see that in the past he has called for capital gains tax to be extended to the family home, and he has called for tax measures to make the cost of homes in western Sydney more expensive. He is a politician; he is perfectly entitled to change his mind. I suppose, as Lord Keynes says, `When circumstances change, I change my opinions. What do you do, Sir?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not blame him for that as such. I simply say that he needs to offer some kind of an explanation as to why it was right to be Uncle Scrooge just a couple of months ago and why it is right to be Santa Clause now. What we see on the part of the member for Werriwa is something that is quite common in the opposition&mdash;it is described as a major backflip. That title of Major Backflip has been awarded by my friend and colleague the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) to the Leader of the Opposition, so I suppose the member for Werriwa is simply Lieutenant Backflip.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are talking about the extension of rent assistance to Austudy recipients. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Mr Abbott), sitting opposite, tried to wriggle his way out of explaining how this is going to be funded. It is very important that young people in Australia focus on how this is going to be funded, because it will have disastrous effects 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7226"> on the incomes of young people in this country and their families.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us remember how this change is going to be financed, which the parliamentary secretary opposite failed to mention. It is going to be financed by taking all 16&hyphen; and 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds who receive unemployment benefits off those benefits. These benefits are already means tested, so families with incomes as low as $5,000 a year are going to lose this already pretty meagre support for their 16&hyphen; and 17&hyphen;year olds who cannot get a job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As my colleague the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) has already asked in the parliament earlier this week, is this government putting any extra money in to support these young people who are supposedly going to be forced back into schools? It has been identified that the government will need to spend $140 million to help schools cope with these 16&hyphen; and 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds who are going to be unceremoniously taken off unemployment benefits and forced back into schools. There is no money whatsoever from this heartless government to help the schools cope with these young people. That is the first thing that will happen&mdash;families will be forced back into poverty and young people, who will not all go back to school, no matter what you do to them, will be forced to earn their incomes in ways that nobody in this parliament would support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second way in which this measure is going to be financed is that 18&hyphen; to 20&hyphen;year olds will have their unemployment benefits means tested according to a parental income means test. The last time I looked, 18&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds were adults and should be treated that way. We expect them to behave as adults and as responsible citizens, but what does this government do? It says, `Oh, no, we don't think you are adult enough to go out, look for a job and make a contribution to your family. We are going to means test your unemployment benefits.' That will not only cause hardship to those 18&hyphen; to 20&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds but also cause significant hardship to their families because, once again, it is families on relatively low incomes&mdash;families on $30,000 a year&mdash;who are going to lose as a result of this measure. It has to be remembered that this 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> measure is being financed by these very significant cuts to the incomes of families and young people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Going to the point of rent assistance, as the parliamentary secretary said, it is absolutely correct that the maximum rate of rent assistance payable to single people sharing accommodation was cut by one&hyphen;third in July this year. So this incredibly generous measure that he is talking about&mdash;extending rent assistance to recipients of Austudy&mdash;is not that generous. What happened in July as a result of this government's changes is that rent assistance payable to single people sharing accommodation was cut by one&hyphen;third.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are dependent on Austudy and sharing accommodation to help defray the costs of living while you get your education, life is pretty tough. I do not know how tough it was for the parliamentary secretary when he did his university training, but there are plenty of students out there totally reliant on Austudy who are already finding that the cuts to all the other programs are very tough. What is going to happen now is not that they are going to get a decent level of rent assistance, but they are going to get a much reduced level of rent assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's justification for this measure was a completely spurious argument about the economies of scale that we heard the parliamentary secretary talk about in his remarks this morning. People who pay less rent because they are sharing with others&mdash;this is the reason why it is spurious&mdash;already receive less rent assistance because the amount of rent assistance you get is directly related to the amount of rent you pay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think the government understands what it is like for people on social security or the social security system. I will just repeat&mdash;it is a very important point&mdash;that the amount of rent assistance you get is related to the amount of rent you pay. It has nothing to do with economies of scale. The reason students band together is so that their food costs and all the other things that go to making student life bearable in an income sense are less&mdash;making sure that they can make ends meet. That is why they band together, not so they 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7227"> can, as you would put it, get more rent assistance than they need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the Senate estimates hearings we were told that the government still does not know how many people have been affected by this measure, how old they are, where they live or what accommodation they live in or whether people who have had their rent assistance cut are living with others who have also had their rent assistance cut. We do not have any of that information. You have no idea about the impact of these changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly, people on this side of the House have been inundated with letters and phone calls pointing out the effects of this measure now that it has been implemented. Single people living in run&hyphen;down private hotels have found themselves with $25 a fortnight less to survive on. Households where three or four single people share are losing over $100 a fortnight from the household income. People have been forced to move into what can only be described as woeful accommodation because it is cheaper. They are the real impacts of what happened as a result of this social security change. So you are not offering this great handout to Austudy recipients. Life is not going to be a whole lot better for them, because the actual benefit that they are getting was much reduced by this government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not bullshit, as you just said. Come on, a bit of honesty would not go astray. Let us just have a look at all the other cuts that this flows on from. We have actually seen a cessation of case management of secondary students on the homeless rate of Austudy and Abstudy, a cessation of schooling incidentals allowance for secondary students on the homeless rate of Austudy and Abstudy, a reduction of maximum rent assistance&mdash;as we have just described&mdash;payable to singles in shared accommodation, an introduction of a two-year waiting period for Austudy for newly arrived migrants, a tightening of the actual means test and the raising of the age of independence for Austudy. This is what has happened to Austudy recipients over the life of this government. </PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To cap it all off we are going to see dramatic cuts to unemployment benefits for young people who are out there trying to get a job.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not the way to encourage young people to go into education. This government and the opposition should be able to get together on this, and a major objective for this country should be: what is the best way to encourage young and older people into education? This measure will certainly not assist them. We will certainly not be supporting the government's efforts to penalise young people further.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;In closing the debate, I think it is worthwhile responding to a few of the comments presented by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Mr Abbott). The parliamentary secretary seemed to be promoting a commonplace defence from this government&mdash;having ripped $514 million out of the pockets of students in Austudy, he now wants the government to be applauded for putting a small fraction of that back in. This is the standard defence of this government in each of its cost cutting measures. It is somewhat like the burglar who ransacks your house, takes all of your items and then returns the next day to say, `I'm giving back the video. You're supposed to be grateful for that.' This is the approach the government takes across&hyphen;the&hyphen;board.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The benevolent Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs claims that he gives back half a dozen videos. Isn't he a nice chap&mdash;having knocked off everything in the house he comes back with not only your video but also videos from other homes he has ransacked. That is the sort of approach this government has. He will give you one video plus five from someone else's house. This is the standard response. The minister has confirmed the response they take 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7228"> on budget management. They take $514 million out of the pockets of students and then the parliamentary secretary turns up the next day and says, `We're giving back a small fraction of that, won't you give me a bit of applause? Won't you give me a few pats on the back?'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was pretty keen to use that Dickens novel for his analogies. He talked about Scrooge and Santa Claus and the like. The parliamentary secretary always reminds me of little Tim&mdash;the spot is set at the Christmas table but he never gets to turn up. He is left to do nothing more than the dirty work for Amanda Vanstone. His spot is always set at the cabinet table. Everyone would have thought that John Howard would be Santa Claus for him and give him a spot at the Christmas table after all that work he did undermining Dr Hewson and trying to knock over Alexander Downer and get Howard back into the leadership. Little Tim in this circumstance has been left out and forgotten again. He has nothing more to contribute to the debate than doing the dirty work for Senator Vanstone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an unhappy arrangement. I know the parliamentary secretary and member for Warringah must feel uneasy about having to defend the indefensible in these circumstances. He was not at the table when the budget decision was made to take $514 million out of Austudy, but he is now left to defend the indefensible here in the national parliament. So it is not an easy task for the parliamentary secretary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These matters of incompetence by Senator Vanstone are widely recognised within the government. For a little light reading recently I was looking through Pamela Williams's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The victory: the inside story of the takeover of Australia</EMPHASIS>, page 322. It is a pretty good chronicle of what the Liberal Party did before and after the last federal election. There was a little gathering&mdash;I think it might have been at the Grand Prix&mdash;after the federal election. The parliamentarians from Victoria had gathered&mdash;Peter Costello, Richard Alston, Peter Reith, Michael Wooldridge, Petro Georgiou and the Kemp brothers, David and Rod. They were gathering, of course, to bitch 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> about the new Prime Minister who had again done in the Victorians, as was always his style. But in doing in the Victorians he did not even look after his best mate from New South Wales, little Tim.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am at the motion. The motion is to disallow this particular regulation. The regulation is bad for the reasons that I have set out, joined by the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin). She has made the valid point also about the government's hypocrisy in these matters, particularly in relation to the common youth allowance and driving 27,000 young Australians back into schools. We are not funding them. This is the whole policy and approach of this government to education: talking up expectations but not delivering on any of them whatsoever.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The parliamentary secretary made a point about how the Labor Party funds its measures. That of course is implicit in our whole approach to education, and it is implicit in the difference between the Labor Party and the government. The parliamentary secretary, after explaining how he took $514 million out of the pockets of students and is handing a small portion back, which he now wants to be applauded for, then went on to ask how the Labor Party funds its commitments. The funding commitment comes from the priority that we give to education as opposed to the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> low priority this government gives it. This is a government that made education its No. 1 target for funding cuts, and that is a complete act of national folly at this stage of Australia's development. Smart nations fund up education as a national investment. It is the best investment to be made in their future. That is what a Labor government would do with the $120 billion funding envelope of the Commonwealth. That would be our set of priorities as opposed to yours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those particular issues are easily cleared up. The whole point of this debate is to again emphasise how damaging it is for young Australians to have uncertainty about their income support arrangements with the wholesale slashing of Austudy and to have uncertainty created by administrative nightmares and not being able to get accurate information, and how damaging it is to have this whole problem of very disadvantaged Australians under this regulation now subject to disallowance having their financial assistance cut by the government. There are 2,600 involved. More will be indirectly involved with the forthcoming introduction of the common youth allowance. This is a bad measure&mdash;one of many bad measures that this government has introduced in education. For those reasons, it should be disallowed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I propose to speak on amendment No. 2, which affects schedule No. 2. My colleague the parliamentary secretary to the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson), indicated that I would be dealing with schedules 3 and 4. I have to confess I am not briefed to so appear and I will leave schedules 3 and 4 to him. I am sure he will do that very well on his first appearance. In regard to schedule 2, the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) has indicated that the government will accept that amendment, which, I must say, is in stark contrast to the outrageous comments that he made when the thing was debated by way of second reading and in the consideration in detail stage in this House when it first occurred.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I can pick up the point that he made in respect of the 1997 bill, it is the case that when this returns to the Senate a further technical amendment will be required to amend the 1997 bill as well. My understanding of what Senator Kemp, the Assistant Treasurer, had to say in the Senate was that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7232"> if that was required it would be facilitated by the government. I do not know what other possible problems there might be so far as this amendment is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment needs to be put into its context. There were three amendments which I moved in this place and which Senator Cook, on behalf of the opposition, moved in the Senate. Two others were rejected by the government and the Senate and this minor one was accepted. But this House needs to understand that which was rejected by the government in the Senate. This measure started on budget night 1996 when the Treasurer (Mr Costello) announced that the income derived from sale of a miner's right would be the subject of taxation and would take effect immediately, as from 20 August 1996 at 7.30 p.m. This removed the incentive for prospectors which had been there generally over a period of about 70 years and which had survived the Gutman report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his report Mr Gutman, at the same time as recommending that income derived from the production of gold ought to be taxed, which was adopted by the federal Labor government and passed through this parliament, made a recommendation concerning section 23(pa), which applied both to gold and to a range of other minerals. I drew this to the attention of the parliamentary secretary when I took him through the list of all the minerals in Tasmania that had been prospected over the years to which this provision applied. I am sure that edified him well, as he now nods. In his report Mr Gutman said that this provided an important incentive to prospectors, and it does.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Section 23(pa) was an incentive to prospectors who operate at the bottom end of the scale. In my state in Western Australia that means one&hyphen;person or one&hyphen;family shows operating in the goldfields or the Yilgarn, kicking over rocks and discovering prospective finds which are then taken over by some of the junior mining companies and, on some occasions, by the majors. This is an incentive which the Treasurer and the government removed without any review, without any recommendation, without any consultation with the industry. They removed that incen 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tive overnight. That caused some considerable consternation. In the course of the last quarter of 1996 the Treasurer indicated that there would be a transitional period and that that transitional period would apply until the end of 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That proposal was referred by the Senate to a Senate committee, the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, which dealt with Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1996. The committee's report had three separate strands to it: government senators who said that the removal of the exemption as from 31 December 1996 was perfectly agreeable and acceptable; a minority report by Senator Cook and other Labor senators which said that there ought to be a grandfathering so that if you held the prospector's or the miner's right as at budget night August 1996 and if you disposed of that subsequently then the income which derived from that sale was tax exempt, as it had effectively always been; and a minority report from Senator Murray of the Democrats, who suggested a five&hyphen;year transitional clause be effected. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the matter got to the floor of the Senate, Senator Murray from the Democrats, and the Treasurer with the help of Treasury officials, agreed to a five&hyphen;year transitional arrangement which was predicated on a valuation of the prospector's right as at 20 August 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the regime that was put in place as a result of the 1996 Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) was that, if you were the owner of a prospector's or a miner's right as at budget night on August 1996 and you disposed of that right any time up to the equivalent date in 2001, 20 August 2001, then what was tax exempt was the value of the miner's right as it was valued at budget night 1996 and you were taxed on the difference if the income derived was greater than that valued. It was also a requirement of that amendment which was moved by Senator Murray and agreed to by the government that you had to be a bona fide prospector at the time of the 1996 budget but also at the time that you derived the income.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7233">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That amendment was subsequently discovered to be technically deficient and that is why we see the matter now come back before us in the 1997 bill. The 1997 bill seeks to rectify the technical deficiencies that the government made in the course of the 1996 bill. Having been presented with the opportunity, I took it and in the House moved three amendments. The first was an amendment to reflect Senator Cook's minority report to grandfather these matters entirely. That was rejected by the parliamentary secretary and the government, and it was rejected again in the Senate when Senator Cook subsequently moved it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second amendment I moved was a five&hyphen;year straight transitional arrangement to remove the unworkable and unfair valuation clauses. That was rejected by the parliamentary secretary and the government in this chamber and rejected again by the government and the Democrat senators in the Senate recently. The effect of that amendment was to remove the valuation requirements. The valuation requirements that the government has imposed upon the industry, additional upon the incentive they have taken away from prospectors to be out there prospecting, work in this way. If you are a prospector and you held a miner's or a prospector's right on budget night, 20 August 1996, and if you derive income from the sale of that miner's right any time between that moment in time and the equivalent date in 2001, then you will be tax exempt on the value of the miner's right as at budget night 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So you have to go out at least 12 months after the event and get a valuation of your miner's right as at August 1996, knowing when you do that at any point in the cycle the tax commissioner can go behind that valuation and ignore it if he wants to. The burden is now on prospectors to go out and get a valuation of something which in very many respects is highly unlikely or unable to be accurately valued. The whole nature of prospecting is, of course, that as soon as something is discovered the value changes. The value might change remarkably or it might change modestly. That is the whole nature of prospecting. That is the whole nature of the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> incentive of section 23(pa) which was there. That is the whole rationale of Mr Gutman when he made his recommendation that, while the income derived from gold ought to be taxable, and it has been as a consequence of the report, this incentive should be there, not just for gold prospectors but for other minerals as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has the government finally agreed to? The government has agreed to the third amendment that I moved in this place, to remove the requirement that you be a bona fide prospector at the time the income is derived. When I made this suggestion in the House the parliamentary secretary was not in a position to put forward any effective arguments as to why it ought not to be adopted, but he would not even countenance it. The argument I used in the chamber on that occasion was that a requirement that you be a bona fide prospector at the time you derive the income, which could be at any point in the cycle up to 20 August 2001, was unfair. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Returning to the valuation regime, the valuation which occurs on miners' rights is in very many respects an intangible thing. You now place the burden on prospectors to go out and get a valuation of what their miner's right was worth as at budget night 1996. The tax commissioner can at any point in the cycle go behind that if he wants to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The modest amendment which the government now proposes to agree to takes away the unfair aspect that you must be a prospector when you derive the income, but it does not change the unworkable, unfair and effectively retrospective nature of the five&hyphen;year valuation provisions which the government has inserted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This issue has created some interest in Western Australia, and it was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> on Tuesday of this week. In the course of my conversation with the journalist from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> who wrote that report I made the point to him that the combined forces of the government and the Democrats in the Senate had seen the efforts of the Labor opposition to remove the valuation mechanism overridden.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reporter in his report made a reference to the Democrats and Senator Andrew Murray 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7234"> not supporting a five&hyphen;year valuation regime. That is not correct and it is only appropriate that I make a correction of the record. Whilst Senator Murray has not agreed to the removal of the valuation requirements from the five-year transitional arrangement, it is the case that a five&hyphen;year transitional arrangement was the basis of his minority report and it is the case that he has moved to that five&hyphen;year valuation arrangement and helped force the government away from its original position. I correct the record in that respect for the benefit of Senator Murray, who has at least been listening to some of the arguments put forward by the industry on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also noted that Senator Kemp indicated in the Senate that the five&hyphen;year transitional mechanism which was inserted in the 1996 bill had been put there as a result of discussions between the Treasurer, Treasury officials and Senator Murray. This stood in stark contrast to the memorandum that Liberal senators distributed to the Liberal State Council meeting in December of last year saying it was all their work. That memorandum was signed by all of them, by Senators Ellison, Campbell, Knowles, Eggleston and Crane. I am sure if he had been there at the time, Senator Lightfoot would have signed it as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So they claimed credit before the Liberal State Council in December, but who did the work? Senator Kemp, on behalf of the government in the Senate this week, said that was effected between the Democrats and the government. Where were the WA Liberal senators? Nowhere to be seen. When someone was needed to stand up for the Western Australian prospecting industry&mdash;whether it be gold or otherwise&mdash;where was the Liberal Party? Off the scene.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What do we find today in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> on page 6? `Liberals snub Court over lease profit tax'. Premier Court went to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and said, `Don't unfairly and retrospectively tax the prospectors. Don't do it.' He was ignored. Liberal senators said that they were the ones who got the five&hyphen;year transitional arrangement. Senator Kemp said in the Senate that that was not true; it was not them.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where were the Liberal senators? Where was the Liberal Party when the prospecting industry of Western Australia wanted to retain a policy that Mr Gutman had said in his report was a valuable incentive for prospectors, the mining industry and the minerals and resources industry? They disappeared off the face of the earth. And the only thing we have seen from them is a misleading memorandum sent around to the Liberal State Council, presumably to protect their preselections. I hope the Liberal State Council looks very closely at these disappearing Liberal senators. I hope it looks very closely at Senator Campbell, who had some of the conduct of these matters in the Senate when he let down the industry in Western Australia. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was interested in the comments made by the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) on this matter. It is quite clear, as he says and as is reported in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS>  newspaper, that basically Western Australia does not have a voice in the Senate as far as the Liberal Party is concerned. This is a grave disappointment, given the fact that those senators who represent the Liberal Party in Western Australia gave an undertaking, a promise, to the State council that they were going to do something to protect the interests of prospectors in that state.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a situation where, once again, there is the introduction of retrospective legislation affecting the resources sector and the mining sector, an industry that produces an enormous amount of wealth for this country. We have a problem where the representatives, who you would assume would do as they tell the preselection panels of the party in their state, represent the interests of the state in instances where the federal government overreaches itself to introduce legislation such as this, all capitulated. The irony is that Senator Lightfoot, who came to Canberra on the basis that he was going to be the supreme voice for the state of Western Australia, was not even there. He was absent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You might note, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the three Western Australian Independent members are here for this particular debate. Where are the WA Liberals in this place for

I would be considering very closely whether or not it is worth returning to the Senate senators who let their own state down after giving a commitment that they would put their interests first.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that this government from time to time has either reneged on or has changed commitments it has given to the electorate at the 1996 federal election. The honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), who is next to me, has clearly pointed out the case in relation to the provisional tax uplift factor. We were promised a reduction from eight to six per cent. Then a bill was introduced into this place whacking it up to 10 per cent the following financial year. Quite clearly, if you average it out it is eight per cent both years&mdash;well above the actual growth in income that is applicable, as the member pointed out to the Treasurer (Mr Costello) the other day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A range of measures have been introduced where the government has contradicted or reneged upon positions it took during the federal election. Another commitment was to reduce red tape or compliance on small businesses, but most of the legislation that impacts on small business introduced by this government has increased compliance and red tape. We have the ridiculous situation where the government has increased the cost burden on small businesses to comply with government legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today we are debating amendments carried in the Senate to legislation that in effect introduces retrospectivity in the sale of mining leases. All I can say is that under the circumstances of what has taken place in the Senate, under the circumstances of this so&hyphen;called claim for credit by the five Liberal senators last year that they were responsible for the amendments that were moved by Senator Murray, it is clear that the interests of the state of Western Australia have been well and truly let down. I can only concur with Premier Court, following the outburst the other day in the party room against some of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> his complaints and particularly his complaint about the bailout of the Thai baht, something on which I share his views entirely, that he has to represent the interests of WA. Quite clearly the Liberal Party here has forgotten them and the WA Liberal senators ought to be thoroughly ashamed of themselves for once again letting down the state which they pledged to represent.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am now armed with a couple of pieces of paper. I referred earlier in my contribution to a report on Tuesday, 26 August in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> . I am reported as saying:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Opposition resources spokesman Stephen Smith said the failure of the Democrats and the government to allow a five&hyphen;year transition period was another blow to the goldmining industry.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What I actually said in my release was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the failure of the government and the Democrats to support the amendment&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was intended as a reference to the amendment to remove the valuation provision. That is the unfairness that has been done to Senator Murray there, and I correct that on his behalf.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I move on to the territory of the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing). I see he has been joined by the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) and the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) in this place but I do not see any of the Liberal members from Western Australia. The other night, during the adjournment debate, I said that Prime Minister Howard ought to say in public what he says privately about the Western Australian members of this place, namely, that they are all hopeless and useless. That is reflected by the fact that when the best of them, Geoff Prosser, the honourable member for Forrest, retired to the back benches all the speculation was that Ministers Moylan and Williams would get the chop. I went through the report card about all the other WA Liberal members who I see are absent.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have been at a number of meetings with Senator Murray and the Treasurer. My view is that this was an amendment essentially drafted by Senator Murray, but we attempted to get it fixed up at a very late stage and on the run. It did not achieve what was expected. Senator Murray can speak for himself on the nature of any agreement, but I am not sure that I can add anything further to it.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Senator Cook then drew their attention to the memorandum, and Senator Murray said, on the same page:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think I am obliged to indicate on the record that I had an amendment and the government said they would like to improve that amendment. I had a meeting with the Treasurer. It was hasty. I am not offended by the fact that neither of us got it right at the time. There was a great deal of pressure. The 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> fact is, at the meeting in the Treasurer's office, we resolved the final amendment that was passed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Who was at the meeting? Was Senator Knowles there? No, we know she was in the Antarctic. Was Campbell there? Was Crane there? Was Eggleston there? Was Ellison there? No. Where were they: defending the interests of Western Australia? No? Where were they? Doing the only thing they have ever done&mdash;trying to make sure that they have got the numbers on the Liberal WA State Council to protect their preselection. I hope the WA Liberal Party preselectors take out their admonition on them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At least we find the honourable member for Curtin and the honourable member for Moore here in the chamber trying to do their bit to protect some of Western Australia's industries. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> today, 28 August, we find the heading `Liberals snub Court over lease profit tax'. The article begins:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Premier Richard Court has been snubbed by Prime Minister John Howard and Federal Liberal Party MPs over the imposition of a retrospective tax on the sale of prospectors' leases.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Court appealed to Mr Howard, Mr Costello and all WA Liberal MPs to reverse the retrospective aspect of the tax soon after it was announced in the Budget last year.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Democrats Senator Andrew Murray said yesterday that WA Liberal Senator Ian Campbell, who is parliamentary secretary to Mr Costello, had lobbied him to vote against an amendment that would give prospectors a five&hyphen;year breathing space before the tax is introduced.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So here we have Senator Murray saying that not only was Senator Campbell not able to sign this memorandum; he was out there actively lobbying the Democrats senator against the imposition of a five&hyphen;year transitional arrangement.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In opposing these amendments to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3), I must pay tribute to the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith), who has grasped his portfolio very well. But, sadly, if you take out the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7237"> influence of Julian Grill in the Western Australian parliament and Stephen Smith in the federal parliament, there is precious little else in the Labor Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Gutman report brought down a recommendation that 23(pa) be left alone, for a very good reason. You could not get a drier economist that Mr Gutman. He understood that prospecting is the basis of the continuation of the industry. We need to be finding, identifying about a million ounces a month to give continuity to this industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point that needs to be made is that, while the behaviour of the Western Australian Liberals in this House and in the Senate is reprehensible, this is not just a Western Australian problem. We are talking about the second biggest export industry in Australia. This is a problem for the whole of Australia. It is laughable that this government should claim to understand industry when it has acted against the second biggest export earner for this country in so many different ways. With 23(pa) the effects will reverberate through the industry for a lot longer than this House realises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You only have to cast your mind back a few months to when the Treasurer (Mr Costello) condoned the sell&hyphen;off by the Reserve Bank of our gold, and selling it at the bottom of the market. Here we have these people who have never created a thing in their lives, never created a single cent of real wealth in their lives, selling off the people's asset. It was not their gold, it was our gold. They sold it off at the bottom of the market and punched a hole even further into the market. The only logical interpretation is that the Treasurer or his associates or the Reserve Bank had short&hyphen;sold gold. However, I suspect that the real reason is stupidity&mdash;clear, unadulterated stupidity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must also question the judgment of the member for Perth when he says that former Minister Prosser was the best of the Liberals. If that is true, heaven help the Liberal Party. I can assure this House that my party, Australia First, will be running a candidate against Mr Prosser and we confidently expect to depose him at the next election. I think that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> will certainly be a good judgment of the people if it occurs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to state again that this is not a Western Australian problem; this is a problem for the whole of this nation. What the government has done is damaged our second biggest industry, an industry which is highly diversified, which is much more Australian owned than the rest of the mining industry and which creates a lot of employment in rural areas, but also creates employment where it is desperately needed, on the east coast. I suspect there is quite a bit of manufacturing done in both New South Wales and Victoria which relates directly to the goldmining industry. There has already been a downturn in the industry. You have already had drilling contractors having their contracts postponed. You have got uncertainty in the industry now which was not there before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How can the nation possibly benefit from this? Where is the advantage? On the very day that the Treasurer condoned the irresponsible behaviour, the treacherous, treasonable behaviour of the Reserve Bank, the goldmining companies lost in capitalisation more than they were purported to have gained in the sale of gold. In today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> you have seen a write&hyphen;down of the capitalisation of goldmining companies as a direct result of the actions of this government&mdash;both the sell&hyphen;off of the gold and 23(pa).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is absolutely no doubt that 23(pa) is retrospective. In our Prime Minister (Mr Howard), who leads this rabble of urban centralists, you have one of the great retrospective legislators. I am going to run out of time, but I am going to speak again on this issue because it is so important. Retrospective taxation is abhorrent, and it is happening far too much in this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thought the member for Perth was much too generous in respect of Senator Murray. The fact about the Democrats is that they are the left wing of the Labor Party in the Senate. Instead of putting forward these penny&hyphen;ante amendments, Senator Murray should have been out there supporting the industry. He should have been out there opposing the attempts by the government to attack this industry. The Democrats have forgotten that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7238"> the function of the left wing of the Labor Party used to be to protect the interests of workers. That has obviously been forgotten by both the Labor Party and the Democrats. I will continue. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will pick up some of the remarks of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) and this will be my last contribution to the debate. I will then leave it in the capable hands of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie and the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, the honourable member for Kalgoorlie's criticism of my spirit of generosity: Prosser was the best of the WA Liberal ministers and in the end he did the right thing. Secondly, my spirit of generosity to Senator Murray was simply to correct the record, to make the point that at least he had a five&hyphen;year transition phase in mind. What he will not support is removing the valuation mechanism from that five&hyphen;year transitional arrangement, and it is the case that he supported the amendment that the government is now saying it will support in respect of being a bona fide prospector at the time you derive the income. But it is the case that the only political outfit in this parliament which supports a straight five&hyphen;year transitional arrangement and the only political party in this parliament which has moved for a complete grandfathering is the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To conclude on Senator Campbell and others, as Senator Campbell relates to the substance of the message before the House, the report in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Campbell's lobbying in favour of the tax has angered members of the Liberal State Council</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Campbell was also one of the five WA Liberal senators who wrote to the State council in December, taking credit for a change to the tax so prospectors would not pay in full for five years. Senator Murray said yesterday that the amendment was in fact sponsored by the Democrats.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Here we have Senator Murray and Senator Kemp saying that the memorandum that was sent down by Liberal senators worried about their preselection was disingenuous in the extreme. It was misleading. What could you 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> do that would be more misleading to your preselectors than to send this document around? And now we also have Senator Murray on the record saying that in Senator Campbell's case it went further. He was out there actively opposing the `five&hyphen;year breathing space', as it is described in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS>  today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To conclude on the point of policy, the honourable member for Kalgoorlie is right. This is about prospectors and the prospecting industry generally. It is not something which simply applies to Western Australia or which simply applies to gold. In the second reading debate in this House I listed, for the benefit of the parliamentary secretary, the minerals in respect of which it applies in Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the removal of an incentive to prospectors, which will do damage to Australia's great minerals and resources industries and which will do damage to Australian economic growth, Australian jobs and Australian exports. And the parliament should be aware of that. So far as the government is concerned, this comes in the face of the appalling conduct of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and his handling of the announcement of the RBA gold bullion sell off. It comes in the face of continual attempts by the government to cap the diesel fuel rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So where has the government been in terms of its support for Australia's great minerals and resources industries? Do we see an industry development ethos from this government? No. Do we see an export culture from this government? No. What do we see? We see the Treasurer&mdash;in particular&mdash;and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) taking Australia's great minerals and resources industry, including the gold industry, for granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did we hear from Treasurer Costello on the day of the gold sell off? He said, `There will always be an international market for gold because people like wearing gold jewellery.' It took him until about a week later in Cairns to make some supportive comments about the goldmining industry. Have we ever heard the Treasurer say anything about the gold industry in this parlia 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7239"> ment since he has been a member? Someone should check the record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude by seeking leave to table a memorandum from WA Liberal senators to all members of the WA Liberal State Council as well as an extract from page 5573 of Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> for Monday, 25 August 1997 and an article from page 6 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> of Thursday, 28 August, headed `Liberals snub Court over lease profit tax'. That proves conclusively the completely disingenuous way in which WA Liberal senators have let down the great minerals and resources industry in Western Australia and in which they have deliberately misled their political party in Western Australia. I seek to leave to table those papers.</PARA>

Governments talk about support for industry.

You need a big customer&mdash;we have the biggest miners in the world. What we do not have is government will. There never has been any government will. You get members of the government and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) going around talking about support for new industries. They go off on esoteric things like the information super highway knowing full well that they will never put the money into it that Malaysia is going to put in. They miss these golden opportunities to create real industry in this country. What do we do? We do the worst thing: we attack one of the main industries that could provide these job opportunities for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have to look at the consistency of this government. Here we have a government that kicks the gold mining industry in its teeth yet hands out great assistance to the Thai government.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="FILING" NAMEID="QT4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is $1.35 billion.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CF4">Mr CAMPBELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is $1.35 billion in assistance, as the member for Moore points out to me. If the government was at all consistent with its stated policy on treaties, which is weak enough anyway, it would have brought that into this House for debate. There is absolutely no doubt that this money is at risk, no matter what the Treasurer (Mr Costello) or the Prime Minister say. If the Thai economy does not respond we are going to be in a situation where we have an unredeemable debt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite frankly, our assistance there was proportionately far greater than other nations. Japan, which has so much invested in Thailand, in my view should have been leading with a far greater contribution pro rata than it did. But it does demonstrate how this government likes to stamp around on the world stage. I am sure the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) gets up every morning and says, `How do I look in the eyes of the world?' I can tell you that in the eyes of the world he may look okay but in the eyes of Australia he is looking extremely tarnished. Just to illustrate the difference in the attitude, the government rushes to help the Thais but 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7240"> is prepared to kill off and damage Australia's second biggest export earner, an industry that has the potential to create, and already does create, an enormous amount of jobs and that has the ability to create far more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Something has been said about Senator Murray's contribution. Putting a valuation on prospectors' leases is very difficult. Gutman realised that this was very much in the nature of a lottery. The attraction is out there&mdash;wealth beyond the dreams of avarice. These people go out there and expend their time and effort. Mark Creasey was out there for 19 years, with the backside out of his pants, looking for gold. Here was a man who had qualifications. He was a mining engineer. He could have got a good job but he preferred to be out there looking for his El Dorado. Eventually he found it. Good luck to him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where is this spirit of free enterprise that the Liberal Party used to talk about? They should be encouraging these people. Instead, they try to put a value on it. How can you put a value on these leases? No&hyphen;one really knows. What the Treasurer has done is clearly retrospective. There is no doubt about that. Gutman was quite right; leave the thing entirely alone because it is that hope, that glimmer of enormous wealth that drives these people. That is what keeps them out there looking. Despite all the protestations of the large companies, most big deposits in Australia have been found in the first instance by prospectors. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We see this in assistance to industry. When the government gives assistance to industry, who gets the lion's share of it? Companies like BHP. What did BHP ever achieve? They take the money and they spend it but they inevitably buy up technology developed by small and medium sized businesses. It is quite clear that the whole thing is skewed in the wrong way. The government has to look at this in a logical and rational manner. If it does that it will see the folly of what it has done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Joseph Gutnick from Central Mining, a man for whom I have a high regard, kept exploring. When everyone else had pulled their dollars out of exploration, Joe was out there still looking for gold. And he was successful. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> His advice to the Reserve Bank was to go out and buy the gold back. They could have redeemed their stupidity. There is still time for the government to redeem its stupidity and to reverse the decision it made on 23(pa). There is absolutely no doubt that 23(pa) will affect the industry. No&hyphen;one can deny that that is going to happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I know that the socialist ethic is very strong in the government, you have to consider the incentive that 23(pa) does provide to this industry. The industry is having enormous problems. It needs to find $1 million a month to maintain a future production. It has to identify that resource. It is now faced with native title. We have just about exhausted all of the brownfield sites; we are now going to the greenfield sites. Every greenfield site is going to run headlong into native title. This government sat on its hands. I went to the Prime Minister and urged him to move quickly to extinguish native title on pastoral leases. After all, Paul Keating believed that was the case. Had the Prime Minister had the courage to do that the High Court would probably have reacted differently in its stupid Wik decision. But he did not have the nerve. He said to me, `It would be too provocative.' Government is basically about leadership. Provocative to whom? I will tell you: to that constituency they have in Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have pointed out many times that Sydney is an enormous aberration to Australian politics. It is not Canberra; it is the members from both parties from Melbourne and Sydney who come here&mdash;the single issue people. They have no concept of how wealth is really created in this land. I have said in the past that perhaps Australia's salvation lay in the nuking of Sydney. I said it in jest; my views on that are certainly hardening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a real problem. There is no city in Australia that lives on its intrinsic wealth. None of them survive on intrinsic wealth; this wealth is provided to Australia by the hinterland. It is collected in the cities and they get the benefit of it. Even in Western Australia, where the state Liberal Party imposed a royalty on gold, Mr Barnett said that he wanted the money to be spent in Perth. He wanted to take the wealth of the goldfields 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7241"> and spend it in Perth to provide pork&hyphen;barrelling to a Perth constituency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen this in their north bridge tunnel. They are building a tunnel that will cost $&half; billion. That tunnel will not generate one ounce of wealth, not one shekel. It will be all cost. That money spent in my electorate would bituminise every road, open up new mines, fix up all the crossings on the Gibb River road in the Tanami Desert and there would be enough money left over to fix up the railway stations into Perth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But no, they spend it all in Perth where it is all cost to the taxpayers. Why? Because the people live in Perth, and they think the people in Perth want it. The people in Perth are totally disinterested in it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what is this government going to do? Throw $100 million at an Alice Springs&hyphen;Darwin railway. This railway is fruit loop stuff. The government know that. They are not interested in building a railway. They are interested in pork&hyphen;barrelling elections in South Australia and the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If that money were to be spent in my electorate, where changes to road funding have swept millions of dollars away from the state government, it would provide real wealth, create real wealth for the whole of Australia. But they are more interested in this stunt to try to influence the elections in Victoria and New South Wales. And what about Tasmania which is dying on its feet?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, I will try to direct myself to the bill. I can understand the member's sensitivity. He sits on his hands while the government lets 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Tasmania die on its feet and pork&hyphen;barrels the rest of us. But these things are germane. We are talking about attitudes of government here&mdash;what governments do in their unthinking way. They just roll on like some out of control juggernaut.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this bill actually does is inhibit prospecting. Prospecting is the basis of the industry. If you stop the prospecting, eventually you will stop the whole industry. There is absolutely no doubt about that. What incentive is there now for people like Mark Creasey who have contributed an enormous amount to this country? What incentive is there for them to go out and risk life and limb and health and wealth in remote areas under very trying conditions, particularly in the summer, under the present regime? There is simply none at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prospecting will no longer occur. It will just stop. It will simply decline. It will become the pastime of a few retirees who are content to go out and try to find the odd nugget. There will no longer be any prospecting with any consistency out there, with people loaming up and finding out where gold is shed from. That is how you find mines. You do not find them by just going around trusting your luck to electronic prospecting. You have taken away this incentive. How can this be in the national interest? The thinking is just so short term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are seeing with the Senate is the rejection of the very modest amendments put forward. I say they are very modest; they are totally inadequate, in my view. There is absolutely no doubt that, had those Liberal Party senators&mdash;my namesake foremost amongst them&mdash;been prepared to put the interests of Western Australia and the nation before the socialist policies of their government, this would not occur. If as senators they were prepared to represent the interests of their state, this would not occur. They are clearly not doing what they were elected to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can only hope that the member for Moore (Mr Filing)&mdash;who seems to have an insight, probably from experience, into the preselection process in Western Australia&mdash;is right and that the Liberal Party will take its vengeance on these people. They have clearly 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7242"> sold out the interests of the state&mdash;but, in doing so, they have sold out the interests of the entire nation. This has to be said over and over again: this is not a parochial Western Australian issue; this is about the wealth of the nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is not a lot more I can say on this. I am sick to the gut with the attitude of the senators and the members of the Liberal Party who should be in this place today. They should have been opposing this. They are just not here. There is no regard at all for the people whom they are supposed to represent. I can only hope that this is remembered at the ballot box.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would just like to make a few comments following the debate which has occurred. The member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) said that this government has done nothing for business. I can assure you that that is not the view of business out there. This government is respected by business for what it is doing. There is no doubt about that. I will make a light remark to the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell): I suspect Senator Campbell will be relieved that he is not related to you.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Comments were made about the gold sell off. My understanding is that the gold sell off was made prior to the announcement of the Treasurer (Mr Costello). There had been a major decrease in the price of gold before that sell off. The other interesting thing about that is that, if my memory serves me correctly, when the announcement was made, the price of gold was around $332 an ounce. Even though it had dropped down to $318 or $316, within a few days or a week or two after that announcement was made it was back up at $328. I did not look last night to see what the price of gold was, but I suspect it is back very close to the point at which there was a drop.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the statements made in this debate were not correct in any shape or form, and I would like to make a few comments. The government is not attempting to remove the five-year transitional arrangement; it is simply trying to make it work. I do not think that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> was understood by two or three people who have commented on it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government did not support either of the three amendments moved by the Labor Party in the Senate. What we sought to do was to ensure that the Senate's amendments of December 1996 worked effectively. The December 1996 amendments contained technical defects. The government will accept the Senate's amendment No. 2, although we believe it goes beyond what was intended by the Senate last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government does not agree that our mining right proposal is retrospective in any sense. I want to emphasise that: we do not agree with the concept that it is retrospective in any shape or form. The government in the 1996 budget night proposal was consistent with past practice when any tax benefit was removed. The budget announcement proposed that the tax exemption provided by 23(pa) would not be available in respect of income derived under contracts entered into after 7.30 on budget night.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, following concerns expressed about the measure, including very vocal concerns&mdash;and I emphasise very vocal&mdash;by the Western Australian members and senators of the Liberal Party, the Treasurer announced on 16 October 1996 that, to ensure that the transitional provisions were fair to prospectors who were in the process of selling tenements when the announcement was made, the government has decided that the measure would not apply with respect to sale, transfer or assignments for contracts entered into up to midnight on 31 December 1996. I stress those few points which I have made just so that the record is quite straight after the debate which we have just had.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That amendment No. 1 be disagreed to.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This amendment refers to the capital gains tax provisions. The capital gains tax exemption on retirement is one of the government's election commitments to small business and is a central element of its package of reforms 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7243"> to the superannuation system to enhance flexibility and choice in superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The measure enables small business owners to claim the capital gains tax exemption for active assets sold on or after 1 July 1997 where the proceeds are used for retirement. As for the capital gains tax rollover relief, the capital gains tax exemption will apply to trading businesses in which the total net business assets, both passive and active, do not exceed $5 million. The exemption will not apply to businesses wholly engaged in passive investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new capital gains tax retirement exemption will create greater opportunities for small business people to provide for a secure retirement without having to sacrifice continued investment and development of their businesses during their working lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the Senate there has been a debate in which Senator Kernot and Senator Sherry have alleged a range of things. I want to make a few comments about that. The coalition has delivered on its election commitment to provide an exemption of capital gains tax of up to $500,000 where a small business is sold for retirement purposes. The Labor Party and the Democrats are concentrating on the multimillionaires taking advantage of the exemption, on people with expensive personal assets such as antiques or yachts that the majority of small business owners will not have. In other words, they are arguing from individual cases to the general situation to apply to all small business people, which is quite ludicrous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The exemption is available to all small business taxpayers provided they meet the appropriate tests, including that net business assets including passive and active assets and all pre&hyphen;CGT assets are less than $5 million. Labor's amendments seek to include the personal assets that cost more than $5,000 of small business owners in the $5 million threshold. What they are doing is reducing the number of small business people that will qualify. They really are kicking small business people in the stomach when they are supposed to be giving support to small business. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They purportedly support small business and people providing for their retirement. But in this regard their actions are quite contrary. Only on Tuesday this week Rob Bastion summed it up perfectly when he said, `Neither the ALP nor the Democrats have won any small business friends today.' That is in reference to the debate in the Senate in regard to the capital gains tax. Out there the small business people are very strongly supportive of the government measures in regard to small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate's amendments will also require small business people to incur costs in having their personal assets valued to determine whether they qualify for rollover relief&mdash;their homes, which are capital gains tax exempt, their cars, their computers, no doubt lots of other things like lounge suites and so on. The Labor Party is proposing that all small business people have this burdensome red tape put across them for capital gains tax purposes. It is quite a ludicrous proposal which is being put to us by the Labor Party and the Democrats.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In government, Labor were not interested in small business or in reducing compliance costs, and they have continued the same attitude in opposition. The proposal will mean the family home of small business taxpayers will be included in the determination of whether the taxpayer is eligible for the exemption on retirement. That will be an exception to the general treatment in the tax law where the family home is normally excluded as an eligible asset.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In effect, the proposal would mean that the family home of small business people would be taxed. Small business taxpayers will need to value each and every of their personal assets if they are not certain whether they are worth more than $5,000 or appreciate in value. We reject this proposal which has been put up by the Democrats and the Labor Party entirely.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1997 is an omnibus taxation bill which covers a number of areas which were announced in last year's budget. The major matters covered include superannuation, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7244"> capital gains tax and other taxation issues. It ought to be understood by the House that the opposition has supported the bill in both chambers. We have not only supported it but we have tried and, in some cases, succeeded, to improve the equity of the bill through amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment being debated now in schedule 1 concerns the $500,000 capital gains tax exemption for funds used for retirement purposes. This is the big sweetener; this is the big `sorry' from the Treasurer (Mr Costello) to the big end of town. If you recall, last year the Treasurer imposed a surcharge on superannuation for high income earners and boasted about that aspect of the budget as representing the coalition's commitment to fair taxation and getting stuck into the big end of town. But, with this proposition, the Treasurer is back to the big end of town saying, `We are very sorry.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition have always opposed measures for fairness in our taxation system, including capital gains tax, and in the past have sought to repeal capital gains tax. Their problem is that they do not have community support to do away with capital gains tax, so what the government is seeking to do here, via backdoor means and for certain sections of the community only, is to effectively repeal capital gains tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is absolutely outrageous for the Treasurer and this government to claim that someone who has a net wealth in excess of $5 million&mdash;that is your Howard battler&mdash;should also be entitled to earn another $500,000 completely tax free, completely exempt, provided it is used for retirement purposes. What a nice little super scheme that is if you happen to be able to take advantage of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In our view, someone with in excess of $5 million in net assets does not require any further subsidy from taxpayers for their retirement. They ought to be able to pay capital gains tax. It is ridiculous to argue that the people affected by this amendment are being hard done by. They are already wealthy; they do not require or deserve further substantial taxation subsidies. Accordingly, Labor will continue to support the amendment to schedule 1 moved in the Senate, which the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government is opposing, and will be dividing on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor understands that for many people their small business has been the vehicle by which they have saved for their retirement. We understand that for some people business cash flow needs have precluded the capacity to save regularly in a superannuation fund. In addition, prior to Labor's reform of the reasonable benefit limits, there was a significant bias against small business in superannuation in some circumstances, especially where the businesses were not incorporated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As usual, despite the rhetoric of the coalition, it was Labor that fixed the anomalies that confronted small business, not the coalition. Indeed, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), who was the then Treasurer and the responsible minister, presided over the unfair superannuation and taxation system that prevailed until Labor's reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But this is not about small business; this is not what we are talking about here. This is about big business. Despite there having been a problem historically, there is no modern evidence that a further very large concession is justified. Moreover, if we are going to have a large concession, it has to be targeted to ensure that a windfall is not delivered to people who do not need it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tax, although at concessional rates, is payable on superannuation contributions, fund earnings and final benefits for ordinary employees. By contrast, this bill is proposing to completely exempt from tax a substantial capital gain&mdash;$500,000&mdash;with the only conditions being the age of the recipient and that the funds be used for retirement purposes. This will provide a massive advantage in tax terms between the multimillionaire recipients of this perk and the great bulk of the Australian community who are employees. The average superannuation fund balance at the moment, and hence the average payout if it were to occur at the moment, is around $38,000. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This proposal, if enacted, will provide a disproportionate benefit relative to the general community superannuation pay-out standard&mdash;that is, an amount around 13 times the size of the average superannuation account balance 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7245"> is proposed to be exempt from tax whereas the much smaller sum has already faced taxation and may well face further taxation when it is paid out. Why should there not be a generally equivalent taxation regime applying to both employees and to small business?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, it needs to be remembered that Labor has already instituted a benefit for small business&mdash;namely, the 50 per cent exemption from capital gains tax on goodwill in a business up to the value of $2&frac14; million, which currently applies under the capital gains tax system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition intends to ensure that what the government is presenting as a fair measure is not a big rort which is available to the few and not to the many. That is why we have moved our amendment and why the Senate has accepted our amendment&mdash;to ensure that the personal wealth of individuals, as well as their net business assets, are taken into account in the eligibility criteria for this exemption. There is nothing extraordinary or out of the way about personal assets being taken into account. That is precisely what occurs in relation to the assets test for eligibility for the pension. Labor is not opposed to clearing away unfair taxation hurdles or amending provisions which impact negatively on jobs or on growth. But, having said that, we are not going to sit back and see the comprehensiveness of the tax base eroded by what really amounts to a rort. Let me repeat: the only people who are going to benefit from the government's stand are those who have in excess of $5 million of personal wealth. This is, regrettably, a perfect example of the real priorities of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government does not have enough money for decent child care, it does not have enough money for legal aid and it says it has all sorts of problems with the black hole but it has money to narrow the tax base by allowing this particular exemption. We note that the government has affirmed that what it really means by tax reform is less tax for the very wealthy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been raised in the Senate as to how many people will benefit from the proposed exemption by the government and what will be the cost to revenue. We have in the expla 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> natory memorandum a sum of $45 million being the cost of the scheme overall. What we need to understand here is: what will be the cost to revenue of the government's refusal to support the Senate amendment?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a government which always complains about the Senate costing the taxpayer money with its changes. Here we have a situation where the Senate&mdash;and Labor concurs&mdash;is endeavouring to save the taxpayer money. We want to know the cost of the government persisting with its proposal and refusing to support the Senate amendment. We also want to know how many people will benefit from this scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is claimed to be a scheme which supports small business. The government rhetoric is all about small business. In fact, some 97 per cent of small businesses have less than $1.3 million in net assets. So they are not going to be affected by the limit which we are proposing and by the fact that we propose that personal assets ought to be included in the calculation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some 97 per cent of small businesses have less than $1.3 million in net assets. Our view is that this is not about small business at all. This is about big business; this is about those who are already well off. I would ask whether the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) can advise the House how many people will benefit from the government's proposition and what will be the cost to revenue of the government's proposition?</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then, of course, in reply, the member for Wills comments conceded that there was not enough money for child care and a few of these other programs. That is true, there was not. Why wasn't there enough money? Because of the Labor Party's big black hole&mdash;$10.5 billion&mdash;which had to be sorted out and which had been put on the bankcard by the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What have we done about it? It was not our responsibility but we are doing something about it. We did not cause it but we have done something about it. Within three years we will have a balanced budget so that we can have programs and services which are paid for by the government during the period in which they raised the taxation revenue&mdash;not like the previous government where they just wanted to rack it all up on a bankcard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is about doing something to assist small business so that they are not going to be burdened down by the proposal which has been put to us by the Labor Party and by the Democrats. The Labor Party really are an anti-small business party. It is against small business people providing for their retirement. That is what this is about.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">First they have tried to halve the capital gains tax exempt amount&mdash;Senator Harradine thwarted that attempt to halve the amount to small business people.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find it absolutely extraordinary that the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) would want to, off his own bat, raise the issue of DuPont. What we are talking about here is the closure of a textile factory where 160 jobs at Bayswater are being lost as a result of the uncertainty generated by this government's failure to stand on the Industry Commission's draft recommendations, which are basically an exit strategy in the textiles, clothing and footwear area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They have made it clear that the reasons they have closed down are the Industry Commission recommendations and the fact of uncertainty in the textile, clothing and footwear industries generated by that Industry Commission report and by the failure of this government to respond adequately to it. DuPont joins other factories, Gloweave and Berlei, which have closed since the Industry Commission's recommendations. We just wonder how many it will take before the government wakes up to what is going on there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The parliamentary secretary also said he was concerned about the black hole. But his position on this amendment is that a person with business assets of up to $5 million, with no account to be taken of personal assets&mdash;so they can have their yachts and antiques, whatever&mdash;can still get the benefit of a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7247"> $500,000 tax-free exemption into superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We regard this as simply inappropriate. We believe that it will present new tax avoidance opportunities. There is no doubt that it will become a major vehicle for tax planning by high wealth individuals in the future. This measure should be restricted to small business&mdash;the opposition supports that; we have no problem with that&mdash;and it should not be opened up to big business in the way that the government proposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that the parliamentary secretary cannot provide or has not provided any response to my questions about how many people will benefit from these measures or what they will cost revenue. These are fairly basic questions which this House ought to know the answers to before we vote on these issues. But we do not get any response on these matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition does not understand why the government wants to narrow the tax base in this area. The Treasurer (Mr Costello) comes in day by day and says we need to widen the tax base&mdash;and he wants to slip through the GST&mdash;so why is the government narrowing the tax base in relation to this? Also, how can the government guarantee that this simply will not become another vehicle for tax planners? We believe that it will indeed be a vehicle for tax avoidance and it is coming from a government which is showing no inclination to get stuck into tax avoidance by high income earners. On the contrary, it is creating vehicles for further tax avoidance like the one set out in the amendment before the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that the 1996-97 budget established a high wealth individuals task force, the background to which we got back in February 1996. Former Treasurer Ralph Willis noted in a press release that aggressive planning and minimisation arrangements put at risk revenue estimated at $800 million a year. But the subsequent budget papers, in fact the 1996-97 budget paper No. 1, provide for additional revenue of the order of only $100 million from high wealth individuals, with no figure being put on the possible intake in 1998-99 and the following year.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it would appear that even the $100 million which the 1996-97 budget papers anticipated would be realised is in doubt, and we are getting no estimates of revenue from the Treasury and the Australian Taxation Office. This seems to recognise that the long lead time between that initial announcement in February 1996 and the yet to be enacted measures to discourage these tax avoidance and minimisation practices may be affording high wealth individuals an opportunity to reorganise their affairs to avoid any likely changes in the law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, the government's exposure draft legislation on trust loss measures released in February this year cuts back the expected revenue from these measures from $155 million for 1996-97, which Labor was proposing, to a mere $5 million in 1997-98 and $15 million in 1998-99. So in this area too we see the government giving up on tax avoidance and then they want to come back to the electorate and say that it is all too hard&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a few more points in regard to government support for small business. Quite contrary to what the Labor Party would have people believe, the government is making progress in giving support to small business. I refer to the Yellow Pages Small Business Index and some of the comments which we can be drawn from that. In regard to small business in this country, the sales and profit growth for the current quarter has firmed. That is a good indicator that things are on the way up, that small business are supportive of the programs which we are putting into place&mdash;no doubt partly due to our dealing with the unfair dismissal laws, which left many small businesses with the view that there was no point in employing people. We are doing something about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, small businesses are expecting an increase in employment. That is good news. Small businesses do employ many Australians, and in this last quarter they have developed higher expectations for an increase in employment in small business. Thirdly, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7248"> capital expenditure, even though it has remained relatively stable up until now, in the last quarter rebounded to its highest level for three years. That is promising news. Out there in the small business sector this government's policies are starting to work and to give them confidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fourthly, expectations for the economy over the next 12 months have firmed, and this is consistent with other major business surveys. Fifthly, small business people see the debate about taxation reform as a top priority for this government. Of course, we see the Labor Party implacably opposed&mdash;in fact, it is going backwards&mdash;to doing anything progressive in this country in addressing one of the major issues confronting Australians: tax reform. The Labor Party sees it as a priority in regard to company tax, sales tax, payroll tax, provisional tax, capital gains tax and fringe benefits tax yet, in regard to these types of debates, it obviously wants to drag Australia back to a bygone era.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Overall, there is much stronger support from small business for the present government's policies, as indicated by the index. We have four times more support in relation to the assistance we are giving small businesses than we had in February 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I reiterate that the Labor Party is opposing here a measure, which opposition will be detrimental to small business. The coalition government is strongly opposed to small business people having to value so many personal items in regard to their capital gains tax. We are making changes here to give encouragement to the hundreds of thousands of small business people out there who work hard day in, day out. It is tough going out there. We understand that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Small business people see their assets as their superannuation. That is the way in which small business people operate. Those opposite did not make any provisions for small business people. There was no acknowledgment of their work. We need to acknowledge that 30 per cent of small business people these days are women. This is also a very important measure which is assisting women.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me repeat: this is not a matter about small business at all; this is a proposal about big business. Ninety&hyphen;seven per cent of small businesses have assets less than $1.3 million. The last Liberal Treasurer gave us bottom of the harbour. This measure is about houses on the harbour and how you can still retain your superannuation exemptions. The Treasurer (Mr Costello), who 10 years ago was preoccupied with Dollar Sweets, is now refusing to accept the Senate's amendment. He indicates that he is preoccupied with sweet dollars for the rich mates at the big end of town. The House needs to understand that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I table the government's white paper on foreign and trade policy. This is the first white paper on foreign and trade policy produced by an Australian government. Its publication reflects the government's commitment to a foreign and trade policy which the Australian community understands and supports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This white paper puts the national interests of Australia squarely at the centre of Austral 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7250"> ian foreign and trade policy. Its fundamental message is that, in all that it does in foreign and trade policy, the government will apply a basic test of national interest: does it advance the security of the Australian nation, and the jobs and standard of living of the Australian people? The answers to these specific questions must always be yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A clear sense of the national interest, an understanding of what is important for Australians and confidence in the capacity of Australia to shape its future internationally define this government's approach to foreign and trade policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The starting point of this white paper is that an active foreign and trade policy is crucial to Australia's future security and prosperity.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is crucial because Australia has global interests. It is part of the global economy. Its prosperity is tied to its performance as a trading nation. Its security is closely tied to the security of its neighbourhood. But our horizons must extend well beyond our immediate region. This is the experience of our past and it is the key to our future. For Australia, the alternative to a foreign and trade policy of broad scope is irrelevance and decline.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The policies and strategies set out in this white paper represent both change and continuity. The national interest does not change with a change of government. The priority accorded to the Asia&hyphen;Pacific, the commitment to further trade liberalisation, and the strong support for the World Trade Organisation and APEC are among the important elements of continuity in the government's policy framework. They have been continued precisely because they advance Australia's interests. In other areas, however, this government will continue to rebalance and refocus Australia's foreign and trade policy so that Australia's interests are more effectively advanced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A feature of the government's approach to foreign and trade policy is the importance it places on bilateral relationships as a means of advancing Australian interests. Strong bilateral relationships are not an alternative to regional and global efforts, but they are the basic building block for effective regional and global strategies.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In pursuing these strategies the government will continue to accord the Asia&hyphen;Pacific its highest priority. This document is our declaration of commitment to our neighbourhood as we begin what will surely be the Asia&hyphen;Pacific century. It reflects the weight of Australian interests which are engaged with the Asia&hyphen;Pacific: with the region's three major powers and largest economies&mdash;the United States, Japan and China&mdash;and with our largest near neighbour, Indonesia. It reflects the significant Australian interests which are engaged in Australia's relationships with the other ASEAN states, the Republic of Korea and New Zealand. It reflects the effort and priority we have attached to Australia's relationships with PNG and the other island states of the South Pacific. And it reflects the initiatives this government has taken to deepen Australia's ties with South Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Linked to the government's focus on bilateral relations is a more selective approach to the multilateral agenda. Australia must concentrate its involvement in multilateral issues on those areas where its national interests are closely engaged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">National interests cannot be pursued without regard to the values of the Australian community, including its support for fundamental human rights.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Central to these values is an unqualified commitment to racial equality and to eliminating discrimination. Racial discrimination is despicable whether it is overt or clothed in isolationist nostalgia. The rejection of racial discrimination is a moral issue of the first order and it is fundamental to Australia's engagement with the region where its vital security and economic interests lie.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This white paper is also about the confidence Australia should have in its capacity to shape its future. Australians should not underestimate the assets which characterise modern Australia. Our economy is among the most East Asian oriented economies in the world; an economy larger than any in South-East Asia. Our objective is to build a partnership with the rapidly growing nations of the region. To that partnership we bring many economic, strategic and cultural strengths. To that partnership we bring a strong skills base, the vigour of an immigrant society and an 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7251"> unmatched cultural diversity. To that partnership we bring a broadly based alliance with the United States, whose strategic engagement and commitment underwrite regional stability. To that partnership we also bring our longstanding commercial and cultural links with Europe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia does not have to choose between its history and its geography, as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has so often said. And the priority the government accords to the Asia-Pacific does not diminish the important interests Australia must pursue in the Americas, Europe and elsewhere. These are all important assets which the government will ensure are properly marshalled and strategically directed in support of Australia's national interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">None of this suggests that Australia can afford to be complacent about its future. Internationally, Australia will be facing over the next 15 years a much more competitive global trading and investment environment, a changing strategic environment, as well as uncertainties in some key regional countries. As the countries of Asia grow, Australia's relative economic standing in the region will change. We will be operating in a much more complex and competitive regional environment. Australia will have to work hard and creatively to advance its strategic and economic interests and to influence the regional agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The white paper is a document of policy and analysis. Its judgment is that the two most profound influences on Australian foreign and trade policy over the next 15 years will be globalisation and the continuing economic rise of  Asia. Globalisation offers huge opportunities for internationally competitive economies but also brings challenges for political and economic management. It has profound implications for trade policy. It blurs the division between foreign and domestic policy, increases competitive pressures in markets and makes globally based trade rules and disciplines even more important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The white paper's judgment is that, notwithstanding some significant constraints, economic growth in industrialising Asia will continue at relatively high levels over the next 15 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> years. The countries of Asia will become even more important to Australia as trade and investment partners, and in security terms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's foreign and trade policy objectives  will be geared towards exercising leadership on the issues which advance Australia's economic and strategic interests. This involves ensuring that Australians enjoy the growth in jobs and higher living standards which come from an internationally competitive economy; that Australia's region remains secure and stable; and that Australia maximises the economic and strategic opportunities offered by even closer engagement with the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the path to the security, prosperity and jobs which are the driving objectives of the government's foreign and trade policy. This is the jobs foreign and trade policy. Nothing else will do. Our commitment to the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region and the priority we give it will ensure that thousands of jobs are created for all working age Australians and, of even more concern to them, real jobs for their children. Real security means more than the defence of our borders. It also means the chance of jobs and a decent standard of living for all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's strategy for advancing Australia's security interests is based on a hard&hyphen;headed assessment of the security of the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region. Its key components are maintaining a strong national defence capability, the alliance relationship with the United States, expanding Australia's bilateral, regional and multilateral security links, including through expanded security dialogues&mdash;a task on which the government has recently made great progress&mdash;and strengthening Asia&hyphen;Pacific&hyphen;wide regional security institutions, of which the ASEAN Regional Forum is the most significant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will also be working to ensure that international regimes covering weapons of mass destruction&mdash;nuclear, chemical and biological&mdash;are implemented and, where necessary, strengthened. One of the government's proudest achievements was the key role we played in bringing to life the comprehensive test ban treaty.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7252">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's trade strategies will focus on bilateral efforts, APEC and the World Trade Organisation. Each has a contribution to make to increasing Australia's standard of living through expanded trade and investment. None offers the only way ahead, and all three will be needed if Australia is to continue to improve its trade performance. A major focus over the next five years will be pushing for genuinely closer links between CER, Australia's economic relations agreement with New Zealand, and the ASEAN Free Trade Area, AFTA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Central to the strategies in this paper is a whole of nation approach which emphasises the linkages between domestic policies and foreign and trade policies. An integrated policy framework is crucial to enhancing Australia's international competitiveness. In a global economy the competitiveness of the Australian economy will be the single most important determinant of Australia's future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government believes that economic strength is crucially linked to measures such as labour market reform, investment in research and development, strengthening education and training systems, developing appropriate  infrastructure and implementing effective savings and taxation policies. Foreign and trade policy can especially contribute through improving access to overseas markets for Australian goods, services and capital, and helping Australian business to identify and develop export markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Advancing Australia's interests is a task for all Australians and not just their governments. It requires communication and consultation among governments at all levels, businesses and the community. If Australia's foreign and trade policies are to succeed they must attract the understanding and support of the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This white paper is an important contribution to that objective. It draws on the views of an advisory panel of eminent Australians with wide experience of foreign and trade policy. Its preparation has also involved consultations with state governments, business representatives, community groups and academics.  </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Australia faces a new millennium, the currents of international commerce and of power and influence are shifting. In a new century likely to be defined by the economic strength and increased influence of the major Asian economies, Australia cannot rely on the advantages of geographic proximity and economic complementarity to secure its future. We must engage with our region and understand it and the way in which it operates. If Australia is to realise the promise of the 21st century we must have a strong economy at home and an active voice abroad.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This white paper&mdash;Australia's first ever&mdash;gives Australia's foreign and trade policies the sharpest, clearest focus they have ever had: it represents the coming of age of Australia's foreign policy.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;It has taken a little more than 12 months to produce this document&mdash;the 84 modest pages of text that have just been tabled in the House by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer). The Howard government said in August last year that it would produce this white paper on foreign affairs and trade. At that time the Australian people were promised a `comprehensive vision statement'&mdash;that is what we were told we would get&mdash;which would identify Australia's key national interests; which would examine `the international environment' out to the year 2010 and, indeed, out to 2020; which would examine the manner `in which Australia will pursue those interests'; and which would recommend strategies to advance our key interests. That was the mission, and the government undertook that it would assess all of the implications of all these considerations from the Foreign Affairs and Trade portfolio point of view.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Arguably the publication of the paper today can only do some good for our foreign relations. After all, I suppose it is very difficult to recall a time when they were ever at such a low ebb, and the recent controversy during the parliamentary recess over the leaked Australian&hyphen;eyes&hyphen;only briefing on our South Pacific neighbours was, of course, only the latest in a series of absolute foreign policy debacles. That was the document that de 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7253"> scribed our neighbours and our friends in such derogatory terms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It described one minister for finance of a neighbouring nation as a `compromised lame duck', described an island state&mdash;one of our near neighbours&mdash;as `having ingrained bad habits', described the Deputy Prime Minister of another as `an old radical on the make', and described the Prime Minister of another as `boastful and vain' and `drinking heavily'. It described the Deputy Prime Minister of a principal neighbour as `ever an opportunist' and as `a Methodist by upbringing who does not practise and enjoys late hours in nightclubs', and the Deputy Prime Minister of another was dismissed as a `lickspittle'. That was a document left around to fall like confetti and, in the process, to do immeasurable harm to our regional relationships.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last August I undertook on behalf of the opposition to consider the white paper on its merits. Let me repeat that we will do that. We will do it in respect of the objectives set by the government and our own assessment of the profound challenges and opportunities that will face Australia as we move into the first decade of the 21st century. Much of the white paper&mdash;its discussion on our changing external environment, of the challenges of globalisation in internationalisation, of economic growth and strategic change in East Asia&mdash;is unexceptional. No&hyphen;one should get too excited about this exercise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, we in the opposition have significant differences with the government in respect of how we should approach some issues, particularly the advancement of universal human rights. I think those differences are well known, and I am sure that they are going to continue to be the subject of vigorous debate here and elsewhere. More broadly, I think it must be said that much of the white paper reinforces the widespread perception that the Howard government has little ambition in international affairs, that this is a little Australia government, that this is one with a timid and inward looking approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has spoken of an active and global foreign affairs and trade policy as being crucial to our nation's future prosperity and security. That is what he said, and no-one 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> could possibly argue with that, but the paper's heavy emphasis on bilateral relationships and, indeed, its very narrow approach to multilateral diplomacy is nothing but a framework for diplomatic retrenchment&mdash;a framework for doing less with less in international affairs. Sure, the government speaks of diplomatic engagement, but its practice is frequently the opposite: it is that of withdrawing, of downgrading and of retreat, all of which are covered by spin and nuance&mdash;words such as `realistic', `selective', `tightly focused' and `targeted'. But have no doubt what it really means.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose it is no surprise that the white paper has nothing to say about resource and operational issues&mdash;nothing whatsoever. These have been quietly left out, while DFAT implements its latest round of personnel and budget cuts&mdash;the very cuts that are undermining the morale of our diplomatic service and its ability to energetically and comprehensively advance our national interest. Having received a copy of the white paper barely two hours ago and having been advised by the minister's office of 10 minutes only to reply to it, it is not my intention to try to embark on a detailed discussion of all these issues now. That can wait for another occasion, but let me take the opportunity to remark on what has been hailed in this morning's press as a central plank of the white paper: its declaration that racial discrimination is `morally repugnant' and contrary to our nation's interests, especially our vital engagement with Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubting that this declaration on the part of the government is most welcome. But what an extraordinary state of affairs it is that such a declaration should have such prominence in such a document, in a white paper; that the key message the government feels it must send to our friends, to our neighbours, is that Australia is not a racist state. Read the papers this morning and that is the message. That was the briefing yesterday. That is what the press were being given.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What a shameful state of affairs we have reached. Seventeen months since the change of government, and of course 12 months since the white paper has been in preparation, we 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7254"> have seen Australia's reputation as a tolerant, open and outward looking society take an absolute hammering. It has done so at home and it has done so abroad. Let no&hyphen;one be in any doubt about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth recalling how that came about. We recall those infamous words in this House when the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) made her first speech. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">I believe we are in danger of being swamped by Asians . . . They have their own culture and religion, form ghettos and do not assimilate.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Do we want or need any of these people here?</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I well recall that day. Obviously the member for Oxley and her racist One Nation Party have been the primary source of the cancer that has so damaged our international standing and fuelled the poisonous flowering of racial bigotry. Let there be no doubt about it: every member of this parliament who has recently visited our neighbours or travelled further afield knows we are being quietly crucified as a consequence of the Hanson phenomenon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the fundamental problem is not the member for Oxley, it is not Hanson. The fundamental problem is Prime Minister John Howard and his profound failure of leadership, which has allowed the old images and perceptions of Australia to be revived: those images of the old White Australia, the insular country, one that was essentially racist, alienating our region and alternatively fearful of or patronising towards our neighbours. That, for better or for worse, is Australia's past form, and it is something that successive governments, and Prime Ministers of all persuasions, be they Holt or Gorton or Whitlam or Fraser or Hawke or Keating, have worked so hard, so tirelessly, to bury.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is Prime Minister Howard's singular achievement in 17 short months that, with his silence and with his coded speak, we have seen our international standing absolutely wrecked. We have seen the shadow of White Australia allow it to darken our relationships with the rest of the world. Look each day at the Asian headlines; look at the Japanese cartoons&mdash;you see it everywhere you look. No more clearly could it be stated than in the opinion page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Los Angeles Times</EMPHASIS>, which 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> only on Tuesday of this week condemned John Howard's moral failure over the rantings of one backwoods politician, saying that it greatly endangered Australia's position as a leading nation in Asia and as America's ally. They are words that we should all be mindful of. This is what the article said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">For now, Australia is an ethically hobbled US ally whose long campaign to make friends and influence people in Asia has hit the wall, leaving it in danger of winding up as nothing more than the dead&hyphen;end capital of the South Pacific.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Politicians, alas, cannot always be counted upon for moral leadership. Howard for too long held his breath, hoping that the One Nation phenomenon would somehow go away. It didn't. Now Howard finds himself in the hot seat because of his failure to go after Hanson from the very start.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That article also referred to the AUSTEO documents that were leaked and spoke about the maligning of various regional leaders. It finished off by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The effect of the blunder, in combination with Hansonism, was to reinforce long&hyphen;held suspicions of a patronising and sometimes racist Australia.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What an absolutely damning indictment. What do we have here today? Indeed, what have we had all this week? We have had, again, the profound failure of leadership of the Prime Minister&mdash;a Prime Minister who was challenged by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) to do the right thing in respect of preferences at the next election and who failed that challenge; a Prime Minister who was challenged by former Prime Minister Fraser to do the same and who has gone out of his way to avoid doing so; a Prime Minister who was called upon by the Premier of Victoria to do exactly the same thing, to do the right and the proper thing, to make sure that Hanson was put last on coalition preferences. Put her last; that is what he has got to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But clearly he is going to have to be dragged kicking and screaming to do that, in the final analysis. At the end of the day, he is a very stubborn little man who will do anything possible to avoid his responsibilities in ridding Australia of the scourge of racism, of this dreadful cancer that has afflicted us.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7255">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let there be no doubt: until the Prime Minister does so, he remains exposed to the charge that his carefully nuanced ambiguity reflects base political expediency&mdash;or, worse still, as many people at home and abroad suspect, an instinctive sympathy for much of the member for Oxley's agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No doubt the government hopes that the words of the white paper will start to undo some of the damage that has been inflicted on our international standing, but I think one would be foolish in the extreme to imagine that it will have any more impact than the foreign minister's earlier efforts in this regard, including, may I say, the formation of that much heralded, front page announced, images of Asia unit in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade&mdash;the body which was subsequently revealed, under questioning in the Senate, as comprising a single desk officer. I think this has about the same significance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that no white paper can be any substitute for national leadership. Nothing can substitute for a clear and unequivocal commitment from John Howard that both the coalition parties&mdash;the Liberals and the Nationals&mdash;officially and unofficially, on their official how&hyphen;to&hyphen;vote cards and on those that are circulated at the same time, will put Ms Hanson and her fellow travellers, those racists of the One Nation Party, collectively last on every single ballot paper. Only then will words such as those in this document have any real meaning or credibility.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">On 5 August 1997 the High Court held that business franchise fees on tobacco in New South Wales were invalid under section 90 of the constitution. The franchise fees were held to be duties of excise which only the Commonwealth can impose. The decision also cast doubt on the constitutional validity of other franchise fees imposed by the states and territories. These fees are collected on tobacco, petroleum and liquor. The High Court decision has a major impact on the budgets of the states and territories. In 1997&hyphen;98 the business franchise fees on tobacco, petroleum and liquor are estimated to raise $5 billion in revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of the High Court decision, the states and territories made a unanimous request to the government to introduce federal measures to protect the state and territory revenue. In response to the request of the states and territories, the Commonwealth announced on 6 August 1997 a package of measures to protect state revenues already collected and replace future revenues by increases in certain Commonwealth taxes. The taxes may be seen as state and territory taxes as the arrangements are being put in place at the request of the states and territories to replace revenue put at risk following the High Court's decision.

<PARA STYLE="Para"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">How the windfall tax will work</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The windfall tax will apply from 5 August 1997. The tax will apply whenever a person claims a refund of business franchise fees paid before 5 August 1997 because the fees are invalid under section 90 of the constitution. The tax will also apply if a court orders payment of a refund for a similar reason. The windfall tax will only apply to refunds of business franchise fees on tobacco, petroleum and liquor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amount of the windfall tax will be 100 per cent of the refund claimed. However, the windfall tax will not apply to refunds in two circumstances. Firstly, the windfall tax will not apply to refunds which would have been made even if the franchise fees were valid. Secondly, the windfall tax will not apply to the portion of a refund of a liquor franchise fee which relates to a licensing period after 6 August 1997. This will minimise the risk of double taxation which could have arisen as a result of the other elements of the safety net arrangements which increase the excise on petroleum and tobacco and the sales tax on alcohol. I understand the state and territory governments are committed to refunding liquor licensing fees for the licensing period after 6 August 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The windfall tax is to be collected under a withholding system. The states and territories will be required to withhold the tax from the refunds of franchise fees which give rise to the windfall tax. The amount withheld will be applied as a credit against the taxpayer's liability for the tax. The regulations may also provide for the collection of unpaid windfall 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tax. While the Commissioner of Taxation will have the general administration of the act, he will be able to enter into arrangements with the states and territories for them to undertake that administration.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Consequential Amendments</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also proposed to make consequential amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 as a result of the introduction of the windfall tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is proposed that the refund of a state or territory business franchise fee will be tax exempt to the extent to which it is subject to the windfall tax. It is also proposed that an income tax deduction will not be available for windfall tax incurred. This will ensure the imposition of the windfall tax is income tax neutral.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">SALES TAX</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Four of the bills in this package relate to wholesale sales tax. Three of the bills impose increases in the rates of sales tax. Three separate bills have been drafted to increase the rate of tax to the extent that it is, retrospectively, a duty of customs, a duty of excise or a tax that is neither of these.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Increase in Rate</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rate of sales tax on alcoholic beverages is to increase by 15 percentage points. This means that the rate of sales tax on wine, cider and similar beverages will rise to 41 per cent and for other alcohol the rate will rise to 37 per cent. The 12 per cent rate on low alcohol wine will not be affected by the price changes. The increase in the rates will apply to dealings from 3.30 p.m. on 6 August 1997.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fourth wholesale sales tax bill makes consequential amendments to the Sales Tax Assessment Act 1992 as a result of the increase in the rate of sales tax on alcoholic beverages. The changes all apply from 6 August 1997.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Small Business Exemption</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A consequence of the increase in the rate of sales tax on alcoholic beverages is that it may force some taxpayers over the small business exemption threshold. Of particular concern is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7257"> the impact on small liquor businesses and small wine producers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the small business exemption, sales tax is not payable if the taxpayer's annual tax liability is $10,000 or less. It is proposed that the extra tax paid on alcohol is not included in determining if the threshold has been exceeded.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Quarterly Remittance</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A similar problem arises with quarterly remitters. The increase in the rate of sales tax on alcoholic beverages may force taxpayers over the quarterly remitter threshold, resulting in the payment of sales tax on a monthly basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To prevent this, it is proposed that the extra tax paid on alcohol not be included in determining if the quarterly remitter threshold has been exceeded. This measure and the small business exemption change will ensure that the temporary increase in rates requested by the states and territories does not increase the compliance costs of small businesses.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Taxable value of goods</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of the Commonwealth safety net arrangements, some states intend to implement arrangements to rebate the difference between the new sales tax rate and the previous rate of liquor franchise fees. While the rebate will reduce the final cost of the goods to consumers, the rebate may have the unintended effect of reducing the taxable value of the goods for sales tax purposes and thereby reducing the amount of sales tax payable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In order to ensure sales tax is paid on the correct value of the goods, it is proposed that the taxable value of alcoholic beverages cannot be reduced by any refund, rebate or similar payment made by a state or territory to a sales tax payer in relation to the goods.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Disclosure of Information</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To assist in the administration of the state and territory rebate arrangements, the states and territories have asked for certain information to be made available on the additional sales tax collected. This Commissioner of Taxation is prohibited under the current law from disclosing such information.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill proposes that the commissioner be allowed to disclose limited information to allow the states and territories to administer their rebate arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Credit Entitlements</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As part of the safety net arrangements, the revenue collected by the Commonwealth as a result of the increase in the rate of sales tax on alcoholic beverages will be passed on to the states and territories. If a person is entitled to a credit under the sales tax law, they make seek a credit for the additional 15 per cent sales tax on alcoholic beverages. However, the Commonwealth will have passed that revenue on to the states and territories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, it is proposed to limit the sales tax credit which is available for alcoholic beverages to the amount which would have been available had the additional 15 per cent sales tax not been imposed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">CUSTOMS AND EXCISE</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The remaining two bills in the package make amendments to the Excise Tariff Act 1921 and the Customs Tariff Act 1995 to increase the excise and customs rates of duty on tobacco and petroleum. The excise and customs rates of duty on certain tobacco products will be increased by $167 per kilogram and on certain petroleum products by 8.1c per litre. These increases were notified in special Commonwealth gazettes on 6 August 1997 and apply from 7 August 1997.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Financial Impact</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The increases in wholesale sales tax and customs and excise are estimated to raise around $6 billion in a full year. It is proposed the arrangements will be reviewed within six months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of the revenue collected by the Commonwealth under these arrangements will be returned to the states and territories (after allowing for Commonwealth administrative costs). The package will accordingly be revenue neutral for the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Full details of the bills included in this package are contained in the three explanatory memoranda which I now present to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are debating a piece of legislation which is, I am sorry to say, further evidence of this government's failure to understand the needs of Australian families. It purports to be the family and other measures bill. I agree that it does contain some measures which will be beneficial to families, but it also contains measures which will not benefit families, which will make it even harder for families to make ends meet and, in particular, which will make it harder for them to put a decent roof over their own and their children's heads. To emphasise this point, I move the following:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House condemns the government for its relentless persecution of low income tenants and for its failure to make any progress on the reform of housing assistance".</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I want to focus my remarks today on the appalling way this government has handled 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the reform of housing assistance and, in particular, how it has treated people who are renting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said before, this government's approach to public housing relies too much on the market and too little on basic commonsense. They have compounded this attitude by making drastic cuts. This government has tried to railroad the reform of housing assistance by reducing the current Commonwealth&hyphen;state housing agreement from three years to one. This was when they first came into office. We argued vehemently against this at the time, saying that such an arrangement effectively ruled out any long-term capital investment in new public housing by the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We now know that progress on housing reform has stalled&mdash;completely stalled. They have taken everything back to the drawing board and now they have announced, or should I say `conceded' that the interim Commonwealth&hyphen;state housing agreement will take us through to the end of 1999&mdash;just where we started from when this government first came to office. In the meantime, while the government has dillydallied and has not had a clue about what to do about housing assistance, there has been much anxiety in the community and considerable disruption to public housing development in the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the most recent Howard budget, we have had a further cut to the funds available from the Commonwealth through the Commonwealth-state housing agreement&mdash;a $50 million a year cut which is supposed to come from unspecified efficiencies. There is no evidence in the budget papers or from the government about where these so-called efficiencies are supposed to come from. They are supposed to come some time in the future, even though the cuts start right now. What we do know is that this long period of uncertainty has caused the New South Wales government, for example, to greatly reduce its planned construction of public housing units from around 3,500 starts a year to just 680 this year. It will also mean the loss of more than 4,000 jobs in the building and construction industry in that state alone.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7261">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my own electorate of Jagajaga, tenants in public housing and public housing workers are becoming increasingly frustrated by the uncertainty and delays to the necessary work that this government's half&hyphen;baked attempts at housing reform have produced. The funds for minor capital upgrades have been cut. What that means in practice and what it means for people who live in public housing is that there can be no work carried out to modify housing for tenants with disabilities or for tenants whose increasing age or frailty necessitates modifications to their bathrooms, for example.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of equal concern is the fact that, where housing has become so run down&mdash;and this is certainly happening in Jagajaga, in West Heidelberg&mdash;replacement rather than repair is the recommendation. But there are no funds available so the unit is generally sold, bulldozed and a private dwelling constructed. The government's policy, or rather its lack of clear policy direction, is therefore leading to a net reduction in public housing stock.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Government workers in public housing are becoming increasingly frustrated as they try to find answers to tenants' questions about their likely future. The uncertainty is breeding suspicion and distrust, and all because the government is sitting on its hands. It has failed to convince even the most conservative of its state governments&mdash;yet another example of the very poor relations between this government and the state governments which we saw represented in the daily papers yesterday&mdash;because the state governments can see that there are no benefits to them in the proposals being put under the Commonwealth-state housing agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That the government has failed to carry the states along with its ideas is not surprising, because the states can see that the policies that the government is proposing will leave the states with increased responsibilities and less resources to meet those responsibilities. While the Commonwealth and the states have this argument and it goes backwards and forwards, nothing is done to improve public housing. In the meantime some of the states are just deciding to act of their own accord. In Victoria we have seen the announcement 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that priority access for public housing will now go to the aged and disabled. Therefore, poor families will probably never get into public housing because extra housing is not being built and the priorities have changed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tenants associations have just heard that they are about to be abolished. This is just like the government's attitude to national shelter&mdash;`We can't have any independent groups out there that might criticise the government.' The Kennett government has turned this into an art form and it too has made sure that tenants associations, those groups that do protect the interests of tenants in public housing, will no longer exist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the government's rhetoric about moving to a system which better balances the provision of public housing by governments and the provision of a level of rent assistance to low income renters in the private rental market, the only thing that the government has done in the 18 months they have been in office is cut rent assistance. In July this year the maximum rate of rent assistance payable to single people sharing accommodation was cut by one-third. The government's justification for this, which I talked about in my remarks about students this morning, was a completely spurious argument about the economies of scale that supposedly exist when people share. But the government seems to miss the basic point: people who paid less rent because they were sharing with others were also receiving less rent assistance because the amount of rent assistance you get is related to the amount of rent you pay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During Senate estimates we were not able to find out anything about the impact of this measure because the government has no idea how many people have been affected by it; it does not know how old they are, where they live and so on. We have had many calls on this issue, and not all from young people. We have had calls from single people living in run&hyphen;down private hotels who found themselves with $25 a fortnight less to live on. These are people who cannot afford that sort of cut in their incomes. We have had calls from households where three or four single people share. They are losing over $100 a fortnight from the household income. We 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7262"> have also heard from people forced to move to woeful accommodation because it is cheaper. That is the reality of this government's reform of housing assistance. That is what the government has so far delivered to low income people who are renting privately.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this bill we have the next instalment in the government's so-called housing reform process. People who are, in the government's words, `subletting from public housing tenants', will no longer be eligible for rent assistance. Who are these people who will be affected by this measure? When we ask the government, just like with the rent assistance cut, they do not know. We have asked for more information about the people who will be affected through the Senate estimates process. We have been told that all will be revealed when the data collection has taken place. Let us make the policy to reduce people's rent assistance before we actually know who they are and what will be the impact on those families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apparently we will find out when the state and territory governments have provided the Commonwealth with information about current public housing tenants. We do not know, for example, what the relationship might be between the so-called subletter and the primary tenant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have some idea from our own electorates about what sort of people are likely to be affected by this recent assault on tenants. They are the young adult members of low income families. They are living at home with their parents and paying board to help them out. Their contribution to the total family income is taken into account when state housing departments work out what rent is payable for their home or flat. Their parents already pay a higher rent because they are decent enough to put a roof over their young adult's head. Of course, what we do know is that if this 17-year-old, for example, is looking for a job, from 1 July next year he or she will not get any income support at all. They will not get any rent assistance from 1 January either.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rather than providing that very low income family with the help that it needs, the government is saying to these families in public

This particularly applies to older women who have lost their husbands. The government is saying, `You can't help your sister out and she can't help you.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At Senate estimates on 3 June, in answering questions about this measure, the Minister for Social Security said:</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Senator Newman calls these families colluders, cheats, crooks and rorters. That is her view of public housing tenants. We on this side of the House call them families who need support, families whose help is slowly being worn away by a government who has absolutely no concern for them. There is no double subsidy here. It is just another assault on low income renters&mdash;a cut which paves the way for further cuts to housing assistance down the track.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No doubt Senator Newman would say, `Get out the harps and violins,' as she did when Senator Faulkner pointed out to her in the Senate that the results of her policies are that public housing rental lists will soar, the amount of public housing being built will be reduced, and the quality of existing housing stock will decline. That was the depth of her response.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me also take the opportunity to foreshadow that the opposition will be moving substantive amendments to this bill in the Senate. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Mr Abbott), who is at the table, would be aware that we have been negotiating with the government over some aspects of this bill to get a better outcome for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7263"> low income people. Unfortunately, to date those negotiations have not been particularly fruitful, and that is why we are talking about this bill in the chamber today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Schedule 16 contains the revised impairment tables used to assess eligibility for disability support pension. Members may recall that we dealt with an earlier version of these tables late in 1996 and that, in the course of the debate in the Senate, the government withdrew the tables promising to consult with advocates of those affected and come back with an agreed set of tables.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I look forward to the minister's speech at the end of this debate, when I assume he will enlighten us as to the views of disability groups on the set of impairment tables we have before us. I indicate that, if necessary, the opposition will move amendments to these impairment tables to address those reasonable concerns of the groups which the government has failed to deliver on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said at the beginning of my remarks, this bill is yet another example of how out of touch the government is with families' concerns. From my remarks it should be quite clear that Labor has significant difficulties with schedule 19, which abolishes rent assistance for people who are, in the government's words, subletting public housing. Labor believes that this measure should not apply where the person is a family member of the primary tenant and where the person's income is taken into account in setting the rent payable for the property. I welcome the minister's indication that they will consider amending the bill along these lines and certainly look forward to negotiations continuing over the course of the next few weeks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australian families are very concerned about their jobs. Of course, the government has sat on its hands in that regard. They are worried about how they are going to make ends meet as the costs of the basic necessities of life increase&mdash;and there is nothing more basic than rent. They are worried about how they are going to pay for their children's prescriptions now that the cost of a script has increased, including the cost to pensioners, as a result of this government's actions. They are worried about how they are going to raise the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cash to buy their elderly parents a bed in a nursing home when they get sick.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Families are worried about where their children are going to go to school because their local public school has been closed, and they are worried about how they are going to afford to put a decent roof over their heads as rents increase in the private rental market and public housing is increasingly hard to get into. This bill does very little to allay families' fears and insecurity about their and their children's future.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak to the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Families and Other Measures) Bill 1997 for a couple of reasons: specifically because it relates to families and I have a couple of issues I wish to raise that are relevant to families; also I want to make some points on immunisation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill gives effect to a measure for which I had campaigned long and hard as President of the Australian Medical Association and which was announced in the 1996-97 budget. It is the introduction of a maternity immunisation allowance, an important part of this government's strategy to improve the rate of child immunisation in Australia. I feel very proud to be a part of a government that has had the courage to do that. I also applaud the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) for the welcoming and congratulatory remarks he made of our Minister for Health and Family Services, Dr Wooldridge, when the announcement was made. In fact, if there was more of that in this place I think we would actually get a lot more done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also allows for a family payment above the minimum rate to be made when a family payment child and/or the family payment recipient is outside Australia for up to eight weeks. Currently, family payment is paid above the minimum rate for up to 13 weeks when one or both parents leave Australia temporarily as long as the child remains 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7264"> in Australia. However, if the child leaves Australia at all, the family payment drops back to the minimum rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also addresses a number of anomalies, such as when children travel overseas for quite legitimate reasons&mdash;on community or school sponsored trips or for educational, cultural, sporting or even compassionate reasons. The measure also simplifies the system when either parents or child are out of Australia for eight weeks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition may well argue that parental absence overseas without an effect on the minimum rate of payment has been reduced from 13 weeks to eight weeks. As true as that may be, the child can now travel overseas also for up to eight weeks, and I think that that is a much more balanced and sensible thing for our government to be doing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, the bill will better target family payment by excluding those families with both high assets and a moderately high income. Such families really could not be considered to be in hardship. It will not affect families with genuinely low incomes. Families with net market value assets, excluding the family home, over $406,000 and with a family income above $27,125, plus an extra $4,400 for each child after the first child&mdash;the point at which income reduces family payment to the minimum rate&mdash;will not qualify for family payment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Families with incomes between $27,125 and $65,743 and net assets below $406,000 will still be entitled to the minimum rate family payment. This is unchanged from the present situation. I heard one opposition person only a couple of weeks ago suggest that something else was likely to occur. In fact, there is going to be no change at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Families with incomes below $15,647&mdash;how families survive on that is beyond me&mdash;and net assets less than $406,000 will be entitled to more than the minimum rate family payment. If they have net assets between $406,000 and $602,500 and low liquid assets, they also will be entitled to more than the minimum rate of family payment. If they have net assets above $602,500&mdash;I do not know how many would be in that category&mdash;and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> low liquid assets, they may still be entitled to minimum rate family payment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again it is important to emphasise that this is unchanged from the present situation. It is also important&mdash;I am not here to represent the National Party; it is hard enough representing my electorate&mdash;to stress the point that few farmers are likely to be affected in these income and asset ranges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third tranche of the legislation removes the entitlement to rent assistance&mdash;to which the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) was just referring&mdash;of people who live in public housing but do not pay rent directly to the Public Housing Authority, other than those who live in public housing where market rent is being charged. Public housing tenants receive subsidised accommodation from state and territory housing authorities, which generally charge rent at about 20 per cent to 25 per cent of income. As such, public housing tenants are not entitled to rent assistance. However, rent assistance is available to a person who is paying rent for living in the already subsidised public housing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is ridiculous that rent assistance is available where accommodation is already being subsidised. Quite rightly, as a parliament we worry about double dipping at the high income end of the spectrum. We also worry about double dipping by some members of parliaments across the country. So, too, I think we need to be concerned about potential double dipping even in lower income groups, particularly in relation to funding public housing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I return to the immunisation strategy that is inherent in this bill. From 1 January 1998 it introduces a maternity immunisation allowance that will be payable in respect of children born on or after 1 January 1998 and who, having reached 18 months of age, have achieved an age appropriate immunisation schedule up to that stage, unless of course they are otherwise exempted for medical reasons or they are conscientious objectors and have been counselled accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The maternity immunisation allowance will also be paid in respect of stillborn children or those who die before reaching the age of 18 months. But there may be medical contraindi 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7265"> cations&mdash;for example, there are some children who are highly allergic and sensitive to eggs who cannot have certain vaccines, in particular the measles vaccines&mdash;and also conscientious objectors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Medical Association and the Australian College of Paediatrics estimate that between 1980 and 1990 there were 457 Australian children who died from measles and whooping cough. The 1992 Australian Bureau of Statistics figures for immunisation from the time of birth to the age of six years for the year 1989&hyphen;90 showed that only 53 per cent of Australian children were fully immunised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That puts us behind Tunisia, Colombia, Tanzania and Iran. Those countries generally are not well known for having very high levels of public health, certainly not high levels of immunisation, or for their health initiatives. But they are actually doing better than Australia, which is clearly a developed country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately only 29.5 per cent of children are partly covered, 3.6 per cent have no immunisation whatsoever and 14 per cent of parents responding to the ABS survey were unsure as to the immunisation status of their children. I suspect that within that group the vast majority are just ashamed to admit that they have not had their children vaccinated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Immunisation is one of the most powerful and cost&hyphen;effective weapons that we have against disease prevention. With the exception of safe water, there is no other mechanism&mdash;not even antibiotics&mdash;that has had such a major effect in reducing death and improving population growth. This year alone something like three million children will die throughout the world from vaccine preventable diseases. That a number of them should die in Australia should be seen as nothing less than a national disgrace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some people who are opposed to immunisation and, for that reason, are opposed to the measures in this bill. They cite complications and accidents from vaccinations. Whilst the relatively common side effects are in fact inconsequential and serious side effects almost unheard of, everybody needs to realise that complications and side 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> effects are the price we pay for the protection that vaccines confer upon us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I often say to people, `You would not refuse to put your child in a seat belt in a car or restrain them on the back seat because you are concerned that they might get bruised in a car accident.' Similarly, people refuse to have their children vaccinated, exposing them to diseases from which they can die, on the basis of a concern about possible side effects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The large number of vaccine doses that are administered at an early age when children are prone to various illnesses mean that it is probable that there will be some temporal relationship at times and merely coincidental association between adverse events and vaccine administration. If you have a child who is being vaccinated every two months on average and then a couple of weeks after the previous vaccine that child has the misfortune to develop encephalitis or some other serious disease, not surprisingly some parents and some antagonists to immunisation would say, `It must be due to the vaccine.' That is understandable. The fact that it is given credibility in some sections of the community, and even the medical community, is something about which we ought to be concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at the 1970s, for example, in the United Kingdom there was a great fear about pertussis or whooping cough vaccination and the reactions that might come from it. As a result of that, immunisation rates in the United Kingdom fell 70 per cent to 80 per cent, down to less than 40 per cent. Subsequently, of course, there was a major outbreak of whooping cough, from which children clearly suffered and some died.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, vaccines are victims of their own success. As diseases diminish in their prevalence and adverse reactions gain in relative importance, there is a perception that in some way the risk of having a vaccine outweighs any benefits that it might confer. Unfortunately, I have dealt with younger mothers in my previous life as a medical practitioner who, because they have never seen a case of polio and because they have never seen a child with whooping cough, mistakenly believe that these diseases no longer exist and as such believe they should 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7266"> not have their children vaccinated. The media has an extremely important public health role to play by avoiding the transmission of sensational and at times biased and unfounded information about risks without weighing them up against the benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the best pieces of research that has been done on cost&hyphen;benefit analyses of vaccination was done by a fellow named Holden in 1987. He established that the risk of contracting whooping cough, for example, is 7,995 times greater than any risk conferred by the pertussis vaccine. Of course, we now have an acellular whooping cough vaccine which has even fewer side effects attached to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The risk of contracting measles and dying from it is 60,840 times higher than any risk at all from being vaccinated against measles. Holden calculated that, in developed countries such as Australia, immunisation can prevent approximately 45 childhood deaths and 12 serious handicaps every month. In contrast, the program could cause, potentially, one death every 22 years and one serious handicap every 7&half; years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the minister finally finishes&mdash;and hopefully he will be in this position for some time&mdash;and he looks back on his service as the health minister in this period of the Howard government, of all the things that he should be proud of, one of them is what he is doing in this bill and what he is doing with immunisation. Look at the advertising campaign that we have recently seen running in relation to whooping cough in which we have seen images of a sick baby put before us: people need to remember that the fatality rate for whooping cough for children under the age of one is one in 500. If your child is not vaccinated and contracts whooping cough, they run a one in 500 chance of death. It is one in every 2,500 cases of whooping cough for children of all ages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Turning to measles, it has been estimated that the 1981 outbreak in New South Wales&mdash;when the population of New South Wales was only 5.2 million&mdash;led to 2,200 hospital admissions, five deaths and a cost of $2 million in medical services. Some parents unfortunately think that measles is just like a severe case of the flu, with a few spots on the skin. It is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> much more than that. It is frequently associated with middle ear infection and pneumonia. Every one in 2,000 kids who contract measles will suffer from encephalitis, which is a very serious and frequently fatal infection of the brain. One in 3,000 children who contract measles will die from the disease.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Between 1980 and 1990, there were 57 recorded deaths of Australian children from whooping cough and measles, but it is estimated that that was only 10 per cent of the cases that actually occurred and, hence, the figures I cited earlier from the Australian College of Paediatricians and the Australian Medical Association.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also what I guess some of us would describe as a social justice issue. The poorest coverage in terms of immunisation is amongst lower socioeconomic groups. For example, only 65 per cent of children coming from families earning less than $10,000 per year&mdash;or having that amount of money available to them&mdash;have had any kind of vaccine at all, whereas for those earning more than $70,000 per year, it is over 85 per cent. The problems are enormous in terms of improving Australia's vaccination rate, but I feel that this bill and these measures are going to play a significant role in addressing them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I realise that someone may get up and say that I am straying from the point&mdash;and I am looking at the member on the other side&mdash;but this bill is about families. I find it very hard to get up in the adjournment debate, and when you are on a 26 per cent margin I suppose I can understand why. But in the remaining five minutes that I have, I would like to remind the House of a letter that was published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on 6 June this year. It was authored by a constituent of mine, a mother of a child, trying to survive with a family with enormous problems. One of the issues which we, as Australians and as a parliament, are now trying to come to terms with is the whole issue of drug use, which destroys not only individuals but, of course, families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now have about 20 families in my electorate&mdash;a conservative, relatively high income electorate in Sydney&mdash;who either have children who are using heroin or have lost them 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7267"> because of it. I would like to read this letter to the House. It says:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I climb the stairs of the hotel, a shooting gallery and brothel where she lives in the main street of Kings Cross, and pray she is still alive.

She knows me now and as I enter she staggers to her bed and collapses into total squalor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bed is filthy and the room is chaotic. There are containers of old food, ashtrays spilled over, drink bottles, make&hyphen;up, dirty clothes, candles, some lit, condoms, garbage, some pathetic tokens of house decorating and everywhere there is drug paraphernalia: spoons, candles, wrappers, swabs, tourniquets and a large container of new syringes and an even larger yellow hazardous waste bin the size of a large garbage bin for the used syringes. The curtains are shut, there is no air, a television plays a very blurred version of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mad About You</EMPHASIS> , and there in the bed is my beautiful daughter looking like an angel that fell into hell.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are in a race against time; she is now on the waiting list to go into de&hyphen;tox at the public clinic.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Heroin creates pathological lying. The drug is really powerful and she is in its control and struggling to fight back.

How can I win this battle when speed and heroin are so cheap and so available? I can walk downstairs and buy any drug of choice, and now, to reach a bigger market of young people, dealers are lacing marijuana with either speed or heroin. There is a whole racket that is going on out there that is terrifying. The hotel where my daughter resides is full of young people who look like they are barely alive and are totally exploited by drugs and prostitution. The fact that the Government buses in tourists to view this desecration of our youth&mdash;selling the sleaze like some romantic form of bohemia, offering young girls stripping, smacked

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the way through, he referred to what is often a platitude&mdash;apple pie, et cetera: the question of parties trying to work together on problems. Anyone following the politics of this country in recent weeks would know of his activity around this particular issue. I am a person who represents&mdash;it might be a surprise to some people but it was fairly obviously at the last elections&mdash;the conservative, working&hyphen;class areas of the western suburbs. The kind of response that he is having from constituents in his electorate is repeated within my region,<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">as people do, sometimes for the wrong reasons&mdash;essentially because they are increasingly frustrated by the theft of property from their houses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That might not be the best reason why they are thinking in this direction but, certainly, there is a very strong change of opinion in this country. It is to be hoped that, considering the sentiments that he put forward, people 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7268"> will not use that particular issue for short&hyphen;term political grandstanding and that there will be a degree of commonality around that policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Family and Other Measures) Bill 1997 seeks to amend current provisions impacting on a range of payments including maternity allowances, family payments, rent assistance, the disability support pension and the family tax payments. It also alters the exchange rate process for the conversion of foreign currency income for social security purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As shadow minister for veterans' affairs, I wish to particularly concentrate on schedule 19 of the bill, which seeks to amend the Social Security Act 1991 and the Veterans' Entitlement Act 1986 to remove from 1 January 1998 the entitlement to rent assistance of subtenants living in public housing accommodation. The previous opposition speaker certainly detailed the realities for people in that sector. Rather than any rhetoric about fraud, corruption, collusion, et cetera, the reality out there is that people in public housing, as a general group of the population in any state in this country, because of the downturn in funding for public housing are increasingly, essentially and almost totally social welfare recipients. They are at the bottom rung of this society and, quite frankly, to start saying that this is an area for very significant fraud and implying that people are making big bucks out of this area is absolutely ridiculous. As the shadow minister indicated, it is essentially an attempt to erode and attack family cooperation, to undermine those people prepared to help each other and work together.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This measure was announced by the coalition in the last budget. Needless to say, it is yet another reduction in assistance to battlers that was never raised by the coalition in the context of the 1996 campaign. That is essentially what they are: battlers are not only those people in middle Australia who hold down a job but people who are in the public housing sector in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am concerned both with the nature of the proposal and the way that the government proposes to deal with it. Chiefly, the budget 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> announcement will be achieved by simply defining the rent payable in such circumstances to be government rent for income support purposes. As rent assistance cannot be claimed in respect of government rent, this will bar subtenants in this situation from receiving any assistance whatsoever with their accommodation costs. This is surely a case of legislative doublespeak if ever there was one. It redefines particular private rental payments as government rent payments in order to establish that they are not private rental payments. Quite frankly, the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) has set himself up under this regime as a composite between Leni Riefenstahl, Joseph Goebbels and Big Brother. This particular measure is an attempt to mislead and is up there for awards in the next year or so on that criterion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For many years, public housing tenants have not been eligible for rent assistance from Social Security or Veterans' Affairs, as they are already in receipt of subsidised housing, particularly through the rental rebate system which ensures that they pay no more than 20 to 25 per cent of their gross income in rent&mdash;depending on which state they live in and what category they are in. The Commonwealth helps to underwrite this rental rebate system through its annual funding to the states and territories under the Commonwealth&hyphen;state housing agreement. In this circumstance, it is fair and reasonable to say that pensioners receiving such rebates should not also be eligible for rent assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is entirely fallacious, however, to argue that those veterans and social security recipients who lose access to rent assistance because of this bill are in an identical situation to public housing tenants. Subtenants who are living temporarily in a house or a unit owned by a state housing authority do not have the legal rights afforded to tenants, particularly security of tenure, and nor are they covered by the rental rebate system that I referred to earlier. There is nothing to stop them from having to pay more than 25 per cent of their income in rent if this is the price they have to pay to get a roof over their head. It would appear that their situation is more analogous 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7269"> to that of boarders and lodgers, who are clearly entitled to rent assistance, albeit under a slightly different formula to that applying to private tenants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The administrative arrangements to give effect to this cut are likely to be both confusing and intrusive. The relevant acts are to be amended to say that, if a person pays or is liable to pay rent for living in premises in respect of which someone else pays government rent, the rent paid by the person is taken to be government rent. In effect, this requires the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency&mdash;CSDA&mdash;and the Department of Veterans' Affairs to establish whether the person is living in a dwelling owned by a public housing authority. I note that in an era of spot purchasing, headleasing and so on, determining whether a dwelling is or is not used for public or community housing is something that will not always be readily apparent without extensive data matching between a range of agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is in fact a further complication designed to overcome the clear inequity that would apply were rent assistance to be withdrawn from the subtenant of someone who is not themselves getting a rental rebate because the public housing tenant's income is above the rebate cut&hyphen;off point. In this situation, the bill provides that, where the public housing authority advises the CSDA or the DVA that the public housing tenant is paying market rent, any subtenant living at that property will still be eligible for rent assistance. This illustrates the confused nature of this whole misconceived proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Essentially, these processes mean that the rent assistance entitlement of the subtenant will in future depend entirely on the circumstances of the actual public housing tenant. If the tenant gets a rental rebate, the subtenant is ineligible for rent assistance, but if the tenant pays market rent, the subtenant can claim rent assistance. Yet nowhere in the material supplied by the government on the bill is there any clear information on the composition of the relevant households or the relationships between the tenants and the subtenants. It appears that we are being asked 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to legislate on the basis of untested assumptions about their living arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, the explanatory memorandum to the bill does not estimate the numbers of people who will lose eligibility for rent assistance. As the decision is estimated to lead to a net reduction in outlays of over $58 million in a full year, however, the number involved is clearly not insignificant. The vast majority of these savings are in the Social Security budget, which implies that the subtenants involved are themselves out of work, retired, have a disability or are acting as carers for a pensioner. They are the kind of people who will essentially be hit by this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The frequency with which the coalition has tried to reduce assistance to tenants would justify the belief that tenants are not seen as part of this battlers group, that they are cynically and insincerely promised they will be looked after. This latest measure comes on top of the one&hyphen;third cut in rent assistance to single people sharing accommodation and cuts in the order of $200 million to funding for public housing under the CSHA. It also comes on top of Senator Newman's ham&hyphen;fisted efforts to `reform' the CSHA, efforts which had to be abandoned in the face of vociferous opposition from the states, the churches and key housing groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, this is indeed part of a broader pattern of assaults on the disadvantaged in the context of a public housing sector which is increasingly the domain of those people, and those people alone. In an era when we do not have poorer working people in this accommodation, these are the people who are going to be undermined by this. Whilst the figures provided indicate that, for Veterans' Affairs alone, the reductions are not that high, on the history of this portfolio one would have to doubt the validity of figures because, after all, this is the portfolio where the minister went out and said, `I am going to protect veterans from pharmaceutical changes. There are virtually going to be no changes. No&hyphen;one is going to be affected; they are going to be protected.' Yet the budget papers show that a $26 million saving is to occur over the next four years.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R254">Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Family and Other Measures) Bill</XREF> goes to four separate issues: immunisation, changes to family payments, introduction to new impairment tables and the abolition of rent assistance for people subrenting government housing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson), who has just given his address, chose to focus on one area and one area alone&mdash;that of the abolition of rent assistance. In the spirit of goodwill of which he spoke at the opening of his address I would have thought he might have dedicated a little more time to those measures which he felt warranted the support of the opposition. But we did not hear anything about that because the last thing we want to do in this place is to throw bouquets where they are desired or deserved! In fact, all the member for Reid did was simply to pick holes in areas which, quite frankly, he has failed to recognise as being unwarranted of his remarks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to commence my address this afternoon on immunisation. As the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) quite rightly said, the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) and this government should be very proud of the fact that this bill will leave a lasting legacy in Australia. It addresses not only those economically rational types of subjects but also a social issue and one of health where we will look after the wellbeing of future generations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prevention is certainly better than cure. This measure goes to the very prevention of diseases and their ceasing to have a negative impact on Australian society. I cannot help but reflect upon my father who in fact suffered polio as a boy of four years of age. At that time polio was rampant throughout Australia, as it was around the world. Its legacy is that he has never been able to run or to walk quickly up a flight of stairs, and he always wears a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> caliper. As a young father, I would hate to think that it was through my negligence in not immunising my own children that I passed such a legacy on to one of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rather than going into the detail of the bill, I want to look at why Australians and such an educated nation with such a high standard of living would choose not to immunise their children. The first issue would be the fear of side effects&mdash;an issue also addressed by the member for Bradfield. This fear comes from ignorance, because the statistics that he outlined quite clearly indicate that the risks of any side effects are very minimal indeed and certainly do not stack up when you look at the benefits that can be derived from immunisation. So that is a lack of understanding and knowledge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But then we have those that refuse. When this measure was announced by Dr Wooldridge a couple of people wrote to me to state that this was part of a new world order and that we were in some way trying to do something terrible to the Australian community. I do not normally respond to people like this because, quite obviously, they do not have both feet on the ground&mdash;they are perhaps a few sandwiches short of a picnic&mdash;but I decided to ring one of these women and she said, `I'm sorry, my husband made me sign this letter; I don't agree with it and I have children of my own.' I thought, `What sort of a household would this be?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that refusal simply because of unsubstantiated beliefs is not a reason to put the rest of our children and our community at risk. That is why some of the measures which have been taken here preclude people from simply saying, `I don't want to have my children immunised.' That is not going to be good enough. Parents now actually have to take some steps. They have to physically go along to a doctor to be given the information as to the ramifications of the decision they are taking and sign a statutory declaration that they have received that information and that they understand it. So they have to do something. That is a big step forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that the one reason that most parents take the irresponsible step of not immunising their children is simply that they 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7271"> are too lazy, that they have the `she'll be right attitude' and that `it'll never happen to me'. That is a very dangerous thing indeed, as we have seen with some of the advertising footage recently going to air, particularly with whooping cough. So now, when parents actually have to do something to prevent their children from having the inoculations, it means that they are more likely to take the steps necessary to protect not only their own children but also the wider community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has provided an incentive for parents to take this step. We are not hitting them with a big stick or forcing people into anything. We are actually providing incentives to ensure that they take the responsible step for their offspring.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also educating the population. I think that is an important step, so that people like the gentleman who had his wife write to me can have a full understanding of the decisions that they are taking. This will provide wider community interest in the subject and, in doing so, I believe, will ensure that people will ask the question of each other: `Are your children immunised?' Perhaps then we will have not only an awareness campaign but also an understanding of the poor decisions that have been taken in some instances in the past. We must get rid of the `she'll be right' attitude as an option. By forcing people, if you wish, to take some simple steps to educate themselves and to sign off that they realise they are being irresponsible, we will remove a lot of that `it won't happen to me' attitude.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, I commend the minister for health and the entire government on this bill. I know that we have had bipartisan support on it but it is something for which I believe this government will be remembered for many years to come&mdash;as the government that took the time and the money to take the steps necessary to protect Australian children today and into the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will move on to the other areas within the bill which are a little more contentious: first of all, the changes to the family payments. There are four schedules to be dealt with here: schedules 5, 6, 7 and 8. Schedule 5 relates to the payment of family payment 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> when an organisation has responsibility for a child yet that child may be in the care of a foster&hyphen;parent. What currently occurs under the existing law is that the family payment for a child who may be a ward of the state can be claimed by the organisation, yet the organisation may not physically have care of that child; the child may well be in the care of a foster&hyphen;parent. All we are proposing here is to change that situation so that the person who actually has the day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day care of the child receives the payment. But where they have assets and income over and above that which the rest of the community find is necessary for their eligibility to be cancelled, they will not be able to fall back upon the organisation to ask for that money and then pass it on to the family. So it is a safeguard, once again, to ensure that the money out of the public purse is going towards those people who genuinely need it, and that it goes to the person who actually has the rights and responsibility of looking after the child.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Schedule 6 deals with the children of parents who leave Australia. All we have here is a simple process of ensuring that there is some equity. Currently, the parent can leave the country for up to 13 weeks and still receive the payment. But the moment the child steps out of the country&mdash;no payment. As the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) alluded to, young people who were leaving the country, some on grant&hyphen;a&hyphen;wish programs, were losing their payments, as were others who were representing Australia in sport or who were getting some sort of medical attention; and there were numerous other short&hyphen;term reasons for people were losing their payments. There was obviously a problem in the legislation that had to be addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have now said is that both the parent and the child can leave the country for up to an eight&hyphen;week period and continue to receive their payment. I think that is an excellent and positive response to the needs of families within our community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Schedule 7 deals with the test of hardship for family payment. It may interest the House to know that under the current laws you can actually earn up to $65,734 per annum and still apply under the hardship provision. I put 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7272"> it to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that there are not too many people on that sort of money who could really claim hardship. We have reduced that down to $27,125, with an additional $4,399 for each additional child. That is far more realistic; and we know full well that there are people in Australia trying to survive on figures well under $27,000 and, therefore, the hardship provision is warranted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final schedule is schedule 8, which tightens up the provision of fringe benefits. Once again, this goes to making sure that the Australian taxpayer's dollar is used in as responsible a manner as possible in the social security area. What people have done, in order to lower their taxable income, is to put some of their remuneration package into fuel cards, grocery accounts, share markets and cash management portfolios, to name a few, so that they are actually eligible to pick up a benefit from the government whilst having a remuneration package far greater than was ever intended. These four measures are very responsible in ensuring that Australian taxpayers' money is spent on those people who genuinely need it. We do not want a universal tax system which anybody can dip into, but one based on need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next area of this bill deals with the disability support pension. I would like to explain the bill by relaying a story of a constituent of mine. I was at a meeting some time ago with a group of unemployed people. I said to this chap, `Are you receiving unemployment benefits?' He answered, `No, I'm actually on a disability support pension.' I said, `What is your disability?' He said, `I'm deaf in one ear.' I asked, `What do you do for a living?' He answered, `I'm a farm labourer.' I thought, `Yes, it's really going to cause you great difficulty in carrying out your task as a farm labourer if you can't hear properly out of one ear.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was, under our current system, able to get a disability support pension. Quite obviously, this was not something which was preventing him from entering the work force, but, under the current system, he was able to access this benefit rather than be out there looking for work. Some people would cynically say that it was one of those options that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the government of the day left open to ensure that the figures for unemployment were actually down, because every one of those people in that room on that particular day&mdash;all of about 10 of them&mdash;was on a disability support pension. So the changes that have been brought in simply mean that people genuinely have to have a disability which prevents them from working before they can access this support. I think, once again, that goes to being responsible and spending taxpayers' money in the right manner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, the area that the member for Reid (Mr Ferguson) and the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) focused upon was rental assistance. Currently, the federal government makes grants to the states for the provision of public housing, so those who are lower income earners and those who are disadvantaged in some way and cannot meet market rents are able to access public housing at a much cheaper rate, therefore enabling them to have a standard of living commensurate with many others in society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All we are proposing here is that when they are already, as a household, in subsidised housing, that household cannot double&hyphen;dip. Quite obviously, if a household is receiving a cheaper form of rent due to government assistance, why should a second body within that house be able to get even more assistance? Why not ensure that more people are able to access the available dollars rather than ensure that one or two people, or a small group of people, are able to double dip into the public purse and gain a greater benefit?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These measures are not, as the member for Reid alluded, about fraud; they are about responsible use of the public purse. They claim that we, on this side of the House, have no social conscience. I would suggest to you that the first part of this bill, regarding immunisation, is an effective portrayal of our social conscience. The responsible expenditure of taxpayers' money is the best way you can demonstrate to any community that you have a very strong social conscience; that you use their money not in some misguided fashion but to ensure that it is spread across the greater community&mdash;the wider community&mdash;in the most effective way possible.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7273">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to fraud&mdash;since you have brought it up&mdash;the fact is that this government is now securing in excess of $19 million a week in social security fraud&mdash;$19 million a week. That calculates to about a billion dollars a year. That is more than is spent on Aboriginal affairs and ATSIC for an entire year&mdash;and that is what has been picked up simply on fraud by this government due to the new measures we have brought in. There is a 98.7 per cent prosecution rate for those people who are actually being charged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My wife is a hairdresser and last week she had a gentleman in from the social security office. He did not know what I do and he was talking about how the government is making a big noise of the fact that they are picking up $1,000 million in social security fraud. She said, `I think it is a damned good thing.' He said, `We always knew that money was there; we always knew it was being defrauded.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She said, `Why didn't you do something about it?' He said, `No-one actually wanted us to do anything about it. No&hyphen;one encouraged us to do anything about it and no&hyphen;one gave us the means in which to do anything about it, but we knew it was there.' I thought, `Isn't that a great way to go about it?' It is like, `We know who stole your car, Sir, but we're not that interested in picking it up.' We know there is a billion dollars of taxpayers' money already that we have been able to recover through fraud alone&mdash;more than we spent on ATSIC in its entirety&mdash;yet the previous government did not have the will to recover that money.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a wide&hyphen;ranging bill, but the point I would like to make is that, regardless of whether it is tightening the loopholes from the previous government's legislation or whether it is a wonderful implementation of the immunisation bill, it shows that this government is sending a message to Australia&mdash;that we care for the children, that we care for families, that we care for the health and wellbeing of Australians and that we will use the taxpayers' money to gain the best benefit for all Australians.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Macquarie for his question. Today's figures on the June quarter for 1997 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7276"> in relation to the current account deficit show that the current account deficit for the year ending June 1997 was $16.5 billion, significantly better than the $20 billion forecast in the budget and significantly down on the outcome for 1995-96.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This largely reflected a $3.2 billion turnaround in the balance on the merchandise trade. The merchandise trade was not only a surplus but a surplus in relation to the net services. So in the year 1996-97, Australia traded in surplus on both goods and services. The only reason Australia ran a current account deficit in 1996-97 of $20 billion on the net income deficit was to service Labor's foreign debt. That is the only reason.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current account deficit in this country is not defeated. It will not be defeated because of the huge run-up in foreign debt under the wanton Keating-Beazley Labor mismanagement of the economy.

It was not delivered on time like the other promises of the government because of the obstructive tactics of the Labor Party and the Australian Democrats in the Senate. I am delighted that the policy to allow the discussion at a convention on the terms stipulated by the coalition parties in the lead-up to the election can now go ahead. I congratulate the Independent senator and the Green senator who supported the government's legislation on their last minute decision to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It remains the standing irony of this whole debate that those rabid republicans in the Labor Party and the Democrats tried to scuttle the whole thing. If they had had their way, the process towards a rational debate about the future of Australia's constitutional arrangements would not have proceeded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party and the Democrats paraded this nonsense about the voting system, which 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7278"> was always an absurd objection without substance of any kind. Their proposition was to threaten people with a fine if they refuse to participate in a ballot to choose people to attend a convention&mdash;not a ballot to elect members of parliament, not a ballot to decide on whether or not the constitution was to be changed, not a ballot to determine something directly impacting on the future; rather, a ballot to determine the election of people to a convention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very pleased indeed that this ballot will now proceed and that the constitutional convention promised by the coalition will now take place. Australians will now be able to have their say through a voluntary secret postal ballot to elect 76 delegates to the convention. I am pleased to inform the House that the election for the delegates will take place in November and December this year, with the convention to be held in the first half of 1998.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope to announce very shortly the names of the delegates nominated by the government. I think the Australian public will see that they represent a broad spectrum of the Australian community and also a broad spectrum of views on this issue. I confirm to the House that the chairman of the convention will be the right honourable member for New England, who is the father of the House, and the deputy chairman of the convention will be the honourable member for Lalor, who is also the National President of the Australian Labor Party. I think both of those honourable members will bring particular skills and a particular understanding and also certain capacities for repartee, which will add to the substance and I hope the dignity and the purpose of the convention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have said all along that, notwithstanding the variety of personal views that people may hold on the question of whether or not Australia becomes a republic, it is important that there be a proper discussion and it is important that, if from that discussion a consensus for change emerges, that consensus be put to the Australian people. That was the promise we made to the Australian people. If no consensus emerges, then we will, as promised before the last election, conduct an indicative 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> plebiscite to obtain the views of the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I repeat again what I said in June of 1995: it is the intention of my government and the two parties that I lead in coalition to ensure that the Australian people are involved at the beginning, in the middle and at the end of the debate on this very important issue. I believe the passage of the legislation by the Senate, notwithstanding the obstruction of the Labor Party and the Democrats, represents an important milestone along the process of an intelligent debate and consideration of this important issue.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to the honourable member for Bowman, I would like to take this opportunity of congratulating the Minister for Foreign Affairs and also the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade for the outstanding job that they have done in putting together this first ever white paper on foreign and trade policy in Australia. I would also like to take the opportunity of thanking the many outside experts, including the former Prime Minister of Australia Malcolm Fraser, the former very distinguished head of the department of foreign affairs Mr Richard Woolcott and many other people for the intelligent and helpful contributions they made towards the compilation of this very succinct and compelling statement of the priorities and the values of the Australian government, and I believe in large measure the great bulk of the Australian people, about our foreign policy objectives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to note, as the foreign minister did in his tabling statement today, that our foreign and trade policies are based overwhelmingly on a hard-headed assessment of Australia's national interests. In the first place, that of course means advancing the security of Australia and the living standards of all Australians. We all have a vested interest in a successful and well-focused foreign and trade policy, because it brings direct benefits in terms of employment and improved living standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The foreign minister made the point, as I have on many occasions, that in shaping the foreign policy of Australia there is no requirement that this nation choose between her geography and her history. It is absolutely possible and entirely consonant with the long-term objectives of this nation to invest, as we have and as successive Australian governments have done on both sides of politics, the highest possible priority in the relationship between Australia and the nations of the Asia-Pacific region whilst at the same time retaining a very strong association with nations in other parts of the world. The notion that you cannot do that, the notion that you do have to make that kind of choice, represents one of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the differences that do exist between the approach taken by this government and the approach taken by our predecessor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it is also fair to say immediately that there are many areas of bipartisan agreement between my government and the government of my Labor predecessors. The emphasis placed on the Asia-Pacific region, the increasing linkages between foreign policy and trade policy, and the very strong commitment to regional security are all things that we have in common. If we are to have an intelligent debate, then the points of similarity should be emphasised and acknowledged as well as the points of difference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think one of the other important features of the white paper put down by the foreign minister earlier today is the way in which it emphasises the job boosting capacity of strong export industries from Australia. The white paper makes the point, for example, that 345,000 Australian jobs flow from trade and investment links with Japan alone. Japan is Australia's third largest foreign investor. Those who would denigrate foreign investment, those who would take cheap, populist jibes at foreign investment in Australia, ought to be reminded that they are attacking the security of 345,000 Australian jobs, because they are directly associated with the trade and investment links that we have with the Japanese people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All round, the white paper is a first-class effort. It is a succinct and compelling statement of the priorities and the values of Australian foreign and trade policy. I again warmly congratulate my colleagues Alexander Downer and Tim Fischer for the very fine job that they have done in bringing the document to the parliament.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

The Leader of the Opposition on one hand is saying that all this money is going to come out of the pockets of the drug companies and the shadow minister for health is saying that all the money is going to come out of the pockets of the consumers. Both cannot be right.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that you are trying to have it both ways, and you cannot. You do not understand the pharmaceutical benefits system. You could not keep it under control when you were a government and now you are whingeing when we try to do something that you should have done years ago. The fact is that what we accepted with the pharmaceutical benefits system was a system that was doubling in cost every four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shadow minister for health himself got up in this House in 1990 and complained about how we could not afford a pharmaceutical benefits system that was $1.5 billion. This year it is $2.7 billion. The fact is that this year we are spending $200 million more on the PBS, even after all the changes, than last year&mdash;$200 million that will predominantly go into the pockets of the pharmaceutical companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to the question that the shadow minister for health raises, the categories of drugs, the drugs in those categories and the bench prices have not been determined. They are not being determined on a political basis; they are being determined by an expert committee. Any speculation that you may raise as to what price people will be up for for drugs is meaningless because in the end it will be the scientific experts on the PBAC that make that determination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I would say: why on earth should the federal government subsidise a floor price that is not a market price? The companies

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Grey, who has had a very deep interest in this issue, as indeed have his colleagues in the Liberal Party in South Australia, who have taken a vital interest in the future of AN and its work force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we came into office last year we inherited an Australian National Railways Commission that was in a shocking state. It had racked up debts of $1,000 million. It produced in its last year of operation a loss of $250 million. During Labor's tenure of office administering the Australian National Railways Commission, 7,000 jobs had gone from AN. Of course, AN was mortally wounded by the former Labor government's decision to establish the National Rail Corporation in the way in which they did. Along with that, the staff of AN were shell&hyphen;shocked, disillusioned and demoralised. The customers and clients of AN had lost confidence in that business to provide a service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it was incumbent upon us to undertake some very substantial reforms. Last November 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> I announced on behalf of the government a $2 billion rail reform package to revitalise rail in Australia and, particularly, Australian National Railways. As part of that we agreed that we would transfer ownership of Australian National Railways from the government to the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today, in partnership with my colleague the Minister for Finance we have announced the successful bidders for the sale of AN. I am pleased to say that the sale process has been an outstanding success. The sale has gone to three separate companies. AN has been split into three organisations: one based solely in Tasmania, another one focused on South Australian freight rail and the other one on passenger services. Right at the outset we promised we would not sell AN solely based on price alone. We said that we wanted to ensure the best sale for South Australia and for the rail industry of Australia. So we took a lower price in order to maximise the quality of the bid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we maximised the quality of the bid, we maximised the jobs in AN. We protected every job of every apprentice who works for AN. Not one of them will lose their job. Everyone of them will go on to take a job with a new owner. We maximised the opportunity for those people who work in the workshops, particularly in places like Port Augusta. We ensured that there were no line closures, unlike under the Labor Party's tenure of office, when 14 lines were closed. We ensured that there were no passenger service closures, unlike when Labor was in office, when six passenger services were closed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We ensured that we maximised capital expenditure on the new business of rail in South Australia and Tasmania. Some $97 million is being committed by the new owners on upgrading the rail system that was once owned by this government through AN. Not only will there not be any line closures or passenger service closures; there will be increases in passenger services as a result of the deal that we have struck in this sale. For example, the honourable member for Parkes would be pleased to know that there will be a 50 per cent increase in passenger rail ser 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7283"> vices to Broken Hill as a result of this sale announced today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ghan</EMPHASIS> will be providing services not just between Adelaide and Alice Springs but also to Melbourne and Sydney, improving the quality and nature of passenger services around Australia. When you look at this in its entirety and you add to it the decision by the Prime Minister announced last Saturday of our commitment towards the conclusion of the Alice Springs to Darwin railway, you can see that this coalition government is building Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are building the transport system and infrastructure of Australia to improve the transport services this country has. We are reforming them to make them better. Compare that with the sorry track record of mismanagement and incompetence of the former Labor government. They lost 7,000 jobs through the Australian National Railways Commission, closed passenger services, closed lines, ran up huge debts of $1,000 million and incurred huge operating losses in their final year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under this government, rail in Australia is expanding, not receding as it was with Labor. Under this government, private sector investment will drive the future of rail in this country. Under this government, we have a vision to develop our rail services, to develop our transport infrastructure and to build the economy of Australia to create more jobs not just in South Australia but right throughout our nation.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> mitments that were made, including commitments to the pharmacies of Australia. We made commitments to them and those commitments will be honoured. We made commitments to the newsagents and those commitments will be honoured. We also made commitments to the generality of small business in Australia and those commitments not only have been honoured but, in certain cases, have been overdelivered.

I happen to believe that it is a very important element of life in Australia that there are home deliveries. It has been a very important element of life not only in the cities but also in other parts of Australia, and we are determined to do all we can within the law to maintain that system.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his timely question. The Prime Minister was just saying that this government made a series of commitments to the small business community. In some respects we have overdelivered on those commitments. We are pleased to have done more; we are delighted to have done more. The small business community needs the assistance of a federal government that is on its side. If you have a government that is pro&hyphen;small business, that is a benefit for everybody&mdash;not just for small businesses themselves but for the people they employ, for the consumers that they serve and for big business, which also benefits from a thriving and prosperous small business community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of those promises we made was in respect of the capital gains tax. I think the honourable member makes a good point: that is, these reforms can be introduced and the changes made. But it is also important that people running small businesses are informed of these changes. Apart from the benefit it provides, I think it also gives them additional confidence that they have government on their side, which is so important to a prosperous economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has delivered on those promises in the face of fierce opposition from the opposition. It is amazing&mdash;you opposite created a lot of the problems for the small business community, and when we introduce the solutions you are opposed to those as well. The fact is you like the capital gains tax. You put it on the small business community and you would be the last people to support any relief for the small business community from capital gains tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why you are in favour of death duties; exactly the same thing. If you can do something against the small business community, ask the Labor Party. That is basically 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> your policy&mdash;not just death duties but, as you opposed the capital gains tax rollover relief during the Senate debate some month or so back, it is obvious that that is your policy for the next election. You are going into the next election saying that if you have the numbers you will reduce that benefit, if not remove it entirely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we have seen the debate in respect of those people in small business who ought to be commended, ought to be applauded, for the fact that they have been in small business and they have survived small business long enough to be able to retire from it. You would think that those people would be deserving of some encouragement or, at the very least, if you like, a policy which removes the disincentive for them to be  in small business in the first place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is incredible that the spokesperson on small business on the Labor side says he is in favour of small business but he actually comes into the House and votes against it. That is the ultimate hypocrisy. You claim to be in favour but if you were in office you would have the tax office sending them assessments for liability on capital gains tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The measure that has been implemented which came into effect on 1 July provides rollover relief if you are going from one business into another. That is a very generous benefit. That is a benefit which has been calculated to be worth something in the order of $300 million. It was very well described by Robert Gottliebsen in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS> back in December. We should have every small business in the country hanging his comment on their wall behind their desk. These are the opening words to his comment. He says:</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7287"> reflecting the determination of the government to pursue a hard&hyphen;edged, pragmatic trade policy, we have produced the white paper today, which the Prime Minister commented on and which the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Alexander Downer, tabled at noon today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to that, working group 5, the market access working group of the Supermarket to Asia Council, chaired by the Prime Minister, also had a constructive and parallel meeting to really push on with the agenda of boosting our market access. As a consequence, and reflecting the record figure of $104.4 billion of exports last financial year, I am happy to inform the member for Wannon that Thailand on the overall base approach has in fact lowered its general rate of tariff from 30.2 per cent three years ago to 17 per cent now, this year. That is on an MFN basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to that, on specific matters we have been pursuing as part of the working group 5 of the Supermarket to Asia Council&mdash;case workers with the market development task force&mdash;I am pleased to be able to advise the House that we have achieved, firstly, a reclassification of AMF, a key dairy export, a good result in better and more accurate labelling of that product being permitted and fully allowed on to the Thai market but, secondly, a specific reduction of the tariff on that item from 19.8 per cent to five per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, we have developed new operational procedures between Australia and Thailand to meet Thailand's import requirements for citrus. It is of particular interest to the member for Mallee, the member for Riverina and the member for Wakefield that the market value of this particular breakthrough on citrus will be an additional $2 million, remembering that the citrus industry now, to its credit, exports over 52 per cent of their product to the world.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7292"> industry to address the market failure because of the pricing scheme for drugs in this country was wiped out by a $500 million deficit two months later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What you have is a government that says it has an industry policy to encourage drug manufacturing but, when it comes to pricing policy, from the health minister's point of view, it is a policy that runs completely counter to it. The initiatives that were taken to extend patents to also extend the factor F have been wiped out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What happened when we asked the Prime Minister about that? He said yesterday, `I don't know about this.' This is the man who has been to Brisbane extolling the virtues of this policy, mind you, holding it up as the shining beacon. But yesterday he came into the House and said that he knew nothing about it. Today when he was asked the question again he turned to his industry minister&mdash;I think at the time to throw the question to him&mdash;and, realising that he would get a useless response from him, took the question himself and still did not know the answer. Then he went immediately over to his adviser's box and said, `You had better get out and find this, but by the way don't ask Moore. He has not got a clue. He would not know what is going on in this industry.' The simple fact of the matter is this: the one example that this government has so far held up of strategic intervention in industry has been a failure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me turn to another area of industry policy that this government has involved itself in: the automotive industry. You know, the automotive industry that Labor had been campaigning for months day in, day out, saying, `Adopt Labor's plan for the automotive industry. It is the only plan that will produce jobs. It is the only plan that will produce investment and exports.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister said in here, `That's cheapjack opportunism. Oh, no, we're not going to have a bar of Labor's plan because that's cheapjack opportunism.' Then at the eleventh hour he adopts Labor's plan almost in its entirety. He could not help himself in getting down to Victoria to be at the opening of the Toyota plant. Having told the engineers 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> he was too sick to travel to their meeting two days later, he turns up to wallow in the glory of the Toyota plant, which would not have occurred if it had not been for Labor's plan. Yet this government masquerades on the basis that it is theirs. We do not mind in the end. We happen to believe that industry policy needs to be bipartisan in this country and that it needs to be supported by both sides of government to give business the security under which they can invest. But this government has no ideas and the only policy it has in industry at the moment is that which Labor has developed for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I saw the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) the first day back in here asking the Prime Minister about the Prime Minister's plan for the automotive industry that resulted in the Toyota expansion and what that meant for Bendigo. This was the same Bruce Reid who was missing in New York when the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) and myself were up at Empire Rubber arguing and developing the strategy for Labor's plan. When the Prime Minister got up to ask the question, everyone on this side of the House broke up and they were all looking glum on that side. Everyone in this place who has followed the debate knows that it was Labor's plan, not that of the Liberals. I come now to the question of the textile, clothing and footwear industry.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It also needs the retention of the import credit scheme because it is that scheme which has taken this industry from an inward&hyphen;looking, domestically oriented only industry to an export growing industry. It is that scheme that resulted in the Givoni workers outside Parliament House yesterday with whom the Prime Minister refused to meet and from whom the Prime Minister refused to receive the gift of the dressing gown. Those Givoni workers are not just producing for the domestic market; they are exporting their product, and they are doing it because of the import credit scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Indi now scurries out of the parliament, having interrupted me and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> taken up my time. He should understand that his motion will be meaningless unless it retains the import credit scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor's strategy is this: we say that there should be a freeze on tariffs to 2005, that there should be a review in 2004 that has regard to what our trading partners do and that we should retain the import credit scheme. We also say that the industry is required to set targets&mdash;targets for investment, targets for export and targets for jobs. These are targets that we got with the automotive industry and targets that we are now seeing realised with the Toyota development. We have also said in relation to the textile industry that we want the issue of the outworkers addressed. I am confident that, in the discussions we have had, we will come forward with that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, the government should be embracing that plan now, not leaving further uncertainty and not putting further jobs at risk but creating the environment in which places like DuPont can actually get on and make the investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me go to the question of DuPont, because the government, again, has shown itself to have misunderstood what happened here. The fact of the matter is that the DuPont payment saved the nation $100 million. We should understand that. It was a net saving to the nation, not a cost. The second thing is that it resulted in a zero bounty five years ahead of time because of the cashing out arrangement. The third thing is that that proposal was supported by the opposition. If it was backed by them then when they were in opposition, why won't they support it now in government? Where is the consistency on your part?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More than the $100 million saving to taxpayers that was obtained, we got commitments from the industry&mdash;seven years of them and all of them met, all except the last year. Why? Because we had a change of government. This government is not trying. The only reason the arrangements failed with DuPont is because the government walked away from its responsibility and had its hands off the lever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where do we go from here? The fact of the matter is that on our side we have picked up 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7294"> the phone. We have spoken to DuPont. We have established that, if Labor's plan for the TCF industries is embraced, not only will the existing commitments so far as DuPont is concerned be honoured but we will get additional investment expenditure up to $40 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason the textile plan is necessary is not anything for them directly as a company. They do not get anything because all they have is a five per cent tariff. They stand to gain nothing. But the significance of Labor's plan for the textile industry is for the carpet manufacturers themselves&mdash;the people that DuPont supply. There is no point in them investing if the carpet manufacturers have been wiped out. If the minister does not understand the integration of this industry, he ought to get down to Bayswater and have a look.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have is this situation: the ability, yet again, to secure the market; the ability to create confidence if the coalition is prepared to embrace Labor's plan for the TCF industry. But where was the minister? They could not get him on the radio today to defend the position&mdash;our attack on him about their not enforcing the agreement against DuPont. We finally got him. He admitted today in parliament that he had actually rung DuPont. I would like to know what the conversation was. Did you say to them, `Honour the commitment?' When did the conversation take place? Did you get the commitment from them, as we did, for the $40 million expansion?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an industry minister that has a funny view of life. He thinks the solution to things is through the GST tax reform. We all know on this side what drives the minister. I think he was confusing the symbols when he got the GST up. He was looking at what he would like next. What he did was get the symbols confused.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other day the member for Hotham was on the radio saying, `They should jump in straightaway and make a response. They should not wait for these things. They should make up their mind.' He knows as well as I do that the Labor Party for years just waited for the final report and then just went along with it. It is their reports and their tariff policies which he is now complaining about. It is Labor's policy which is affecting DuPont and other industries today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a consequence of that, we have improved on this. One of the first things I insisted on doing in these industry reviews was to appoint a member from the industry itself to the Productivity Commission. That was a contested matter; nevertheless, they were there, and they made a particularly good contribution&mdash;something Labor never did.

These had the effect of changing the composition of the capital investment requirement, lowering the performance target for investment expenditure in 1994 and 1995 from $8 million to $7 million, extending the period for the achievement of the performance targets by one year, to December 1996. So you watered down the contract even though you could not enforce it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not surprised that you respond in that way to my quoting of the newsletter of the ACTU. Can I just mention a couple of aspects about industry policy, as time is running out. One of the great achievements of the Howard government to date was its response to the motor car industry report. By implementing the decision between 2000 and 2010 we expect to achieve up to $6 billion of investment, increased investment of a very high amount, increased employment, increased exports and increased research and development, and down the track I expect to see design centres for major companies here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a consequence of these movements in investment and these areas, Toyota first responded&mdash;and not because of the Labor Party. While the ACTU geniuses over here were off having a winter holiday, I was in Tokyo speaking to Toyota. In those discussions, we agreed on what their programs will be in the near future, and that was announced in Australia subsequent to that visit. The government's decision in response to the motor car industry is the most significant decision we have made this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to another area of industry policy, we have the PII program, or PIIP, where $300 million is given towards investment in the pharmaceutical area. I have heard some comments today attempting to deride this program. It is quite natural when operating a compulsory acquisition for pharmaceuticals that there is a market distortion. To overcome that market distortion, both this 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7297"> government and the previous government operated a scheme which compensated corporations for doing research and development in this nation. I think that both programs were in the national interest, and I am surprised that you are now carrying on in the way that you are in relation to this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On top of that, the government's industry policy is very clear. Firstly, we were confronted with a $10 billion deficit. That has been rectified. As a consequence, we find interest rates and inflation are down to very low levels. That in itself is a major and significant contribution towards any industry in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to growth in Australia, GDP is 3 per cent, and the Reserve Bank Governor has indicated for the first time in my political career that we could push up the levels of growth in this nation for the first time beyond four per cent without getting the usual contraction within the balance of payments and the blow&hyphen;out in interest rates which follows.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;After listening to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) dissertate on the coalition's industry policy, it is obvious to all in this chamber that there is a kangaroo loose in the top paddock. The opposition rests its case on industry policy. The industry minister of this country has spent five minutes dissertating on the internal affairs of the ALP and the winter recess. For five minutes he has gone into the intricacies of the contract between the previous government and DuPont. With three minutes to go, he tells us that the linchpin of the coalition's industry policy is a low interest rate regime, with a few other macro-economic variables thrown into the equation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very apparent from the contribution of the industry minister to this debate that there is a very insidious disease that is eating away at the bowels of the Howard cabinet and spreading rapidly from the prime ministerial level into the other levels of the cabinet. This 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7298"> great country is currently suffering from a crisis in national leadership. This is not something that has developed overnight but has slowly eaten away at this government's credibility since it came to office&mdash;to the point where 1&half; years into its term of government there is now a paralysis in very key and important national policy areas. Nowhere is it more pronounced than in the industry policy area. Nowhere are the effects of this being felt more than in the great textile, clothing and footwear industries of this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The simple fact of the matter is that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has demonstrated weakness of leadership on too many occasions in too many areas. The industry policy area is one where his senior cabinet minister is demonstrating that weakness of leadership also. There is a paralysis, a crisis of confidence, which is now being reflected in public opinion and in enterprises and workplaces throughout the length and breadth of this country. The tragedy in all this is that Australia deserves better&mdash;better than it is getting from the Prime Minister and better than it is getting from its industry minister. It is not getting the national leadership it deserves from the Prime Minister in key areas of economic and social policy and it is not getting leadership from the industry minister in this very critical area of the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister to date has shown extraordinary weakness in dealing with the Hanson debate, and that debate has impacted already on the future of Australian industry. We have yet to hear the strong statements from the Prime Minister on this particular matter and we have yet to hear any strong statements from the industry minister on the impacts of this on Australian industry. We have seen weakness of leadership from the Prime Minister on the stolen children report. All he had to do was come in here and put us on a new path by apologising to the Aboriginal people for what was foisted upon them in years gone by. He could not do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the issue of ministerial standards the Prime Minister has been found wanting also. In no other policy area is this lack of enforce 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment of ministerial standards more apparent than in the industry policy portfolio. Both the senior minister, the industry minister, and the previous junior minister, the member for Forrest (Mr Prosser), who had responsibility for small business, were under a cloud on the issue of ministerial standards. The industry minister should have gone; the previous small business minister, Mr Prosser, just had to go. But it was only after we pushed the carcass and let it swing in the breeze for many months that the Prime Minister finally realised the damage being done to the confidence of small businesses and to larger businesses in this country by the ineffectual performance of his small business minister. He had to throw a sacrificial lamb&mdash;and the former small business minister was that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On this side of the House in 18 months we have got used to government from opposition. We have led the automotive industry debate in this country. The government picked up on the recommendations that we put before the Australian community regarding the automotive industry and its workers. We are saying to the government: you followed us on the automotive industry. Do not wait for the final report on textile, clothing and footwear. Send the industry a signal now because jobs are being lost. We must send this industry a signal now. It is within the government's capacity to reject the major recommendations of this draft report and give some hope to the enterprises and the workers in those enterprises that it will come up with a policy setting that will guarantee investment and jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor's position on this industry is now very clear. We have said that we will freeze tariffs from the year 2000 to 2005. The Productivity Commission's position is very clear also. It wants to reduce all tariffs to five per cent by 2008 regardless of what our competitors do. Labor's position is very clear on the retention of the import credit scheme. We will do that. The Productivity Commission's position is clear. It wants it abolished by the year 2000. Labor has argued that we will conduct a further review of this industry in 2004. The Productivity Commission has said that there will be no future review of this industry. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7299">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our position, as we articulated with the automotive sector, will lead to an increase in investment and jobs in the textile, clothing and footwear industry. The Productivity Commission in its own report says that 5000 jobs will be lost. There is a clear choice for the government. You can adopt Labor's plan and send some positive signals to this industry, or you can dither on with this draft report and send no signals and we will continue to suffer the job losses in this industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shadow minister, the member for Hotham (Mr Crean), has alluded to the importance of the textile, clothing and footwear industries to the regional areas of this country. In the great state of Victoria, some 10 per cent of the enterprises involved in textile, clothing and footwear are located in regional areas. In my own electorate of Geelong there are 60 companies with a turnover of $440 million, paying wages and salaries of $100 million that go into other private businesses in Geelong. We have over 3,300 workers directly threatened by this report, with over 7,500 dependent on this industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All major community groups in my electorate have rejected, as we have, the major recommendations of the textile, clothing and footwear report produced by the Productivity Commission: the Chamber of Commerce, the City of Greater Geelong, the Trades and Labour Council and the general community. But there is one person in Geelong and one person on the floor of this parliament who stands at odds with the total Geelong community&mdash;and he is in this chamber today&mdash;the member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur). He is the one member in this place who is prepared to betray the 3,300 workers and the additional 7,000 workers and put those families and their incomes at risk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the zero tariff man from the Hewson era, who still articulates that policy. This is the hypocritical member who gets his photo taken with the Geelong delegation for distribution in the community while arguing for the demise of the jobs that he is purporting to protect. There is no greater act of hypocrisy. You will wear this throughout the length and breadth of the Geelong region.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is much at stake in this debate. The honourable member for Hotham has drawn to the attention of this House the critical nature of this decision that the government is going to make. I make this plea to the Prime Minister: disregard the member for Corangamite. He is on his own in the Geelong community. There is too much at stake to follow the false prophets on this. Do the sensible thing. Take regard of this MPI and the sentiments that are expressed in this debate because they reflect the aspirations of the workers in this industry. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government's failure to provide job security for thousands of workers in the textile, clothing and footwear industries.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I do not know what year that was written. It sounds like it was written in 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993 or 1994&mdash;all the way through up to 1996. That is when the MPI was written: the failure of the government&mdash;the ALP at that stage&mdash;to protect the TCF industries and all the other industries in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have sat here and listened to two opposition speakers get up and bluster their way through the debate. Even though I find at a personal level the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) to be quite an agreeable individual, and we have had some good times at the football together, I would have thought that he and the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) would have stood up here today and, rather than bluster, realised the importance of this situation. The 160 people in my electorate who will be affected by this decision certainly would not be taking any heart from the cheap political points that have been made today. They know that the tariff regime that we have now was created by the former government, not by this government. We have not had a final report yet. We have a draft report. We do not respond to draft reports. You never did. We will not be responding to draft reports. At the appropriate time we will make our decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say that as the federal member for Deakin, the electorate in which the DuPont manufacturing site is located, I regret 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7300"> DuPont's decision, announced on Tuesday evening, to partially close its Bayswater plant. I know that not all the 160 workers concerned will lose their jobs. Some of them will move across into the carpet division. But for those who do I regret the unfortunate nature of this decision and the impact it will have on their families and their future circumstances. However, most of those involved are highly skilled and motivated employees and I am sure that with this government's industry policy in place they will be able to secure employment elsewhere. It is a decision that we regret and as their federal member I am saddened by it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In the last three days in particular we have seen the Australian Labor Party going from one stunt to another. When the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) brought a bathrobe in yesterday it was purely and simply a stunt. Was a similar stunt performed in 1990? Was a similar stunt performed in 1987 when Button came down with his plan? Was a bathrobe from the TCF presented to then Prime Minister Bob Hawke? No, they could not talk to him. We have had the shadow minister for industry, the member for Hotham, stand on the back of trucks and say, `Here I am, I am supporting you guys. Tariffs, after all, are bad. You need to be protected.' One thing that I will not be doing is standing on the back of a truck and saying that tariffs are bad and then seven years later saying `Hey, tariffs are good.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The flip&hyphen;flop nature of the member for Hotham is simply indicative of what we have seen from other members of the opposition. They all seem to be changing their views based on whatever seems to be the most opportunistic situation at the time. It really has become a situation of policy by amnesia. I want to make sure that people at DuPont and elsewhere in the TCF industries realise what is happening. And it is not simply the 160 jobs. It is also those people at Berlei and now we find they are threatened over at Blundstone as well. Those people are operating in the current regime. The Labor Party claims that the coalition government has failed to provide job security. The insecurity has arisen because of concerns about the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> viability of the TCF industries. This did not start on 3 March 1996. It certainly did not. Rather, it is a product of 13 years of Labor government. They are playing cheap tricks and playing on the fears of the women and men in this country. People in my electorate will certainly see right through it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me give you an indication of that. In an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 26 August 1997 Glenn Milne, the chief political correspondent for the Seven network, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In October 1995, with the election looming, Beazley sang the praises of Labor's pro&hyphen;competitive policies, stressing in an "achievements document" that  these policies involved choices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The government did not have to deregulate the economy and open it up to international competition in response to globalisation of the world economy and the collapse of prices . . . "</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Labor could have turned its back on these challenges, raised tariffs, restricted competition in the financial sector, increased subsidies and isolated the country further as successive conservative governments have done. In doing so, Labor could have let Australians' living standards fall."</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What has changed since then? Once again it is a flip&hyphen;flop situation. Well done to the Labor Party. Well done to the hypocrisy of the Labor Party in what they are trying to sell at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In opposition it is easy to oppose for the sake of opposing. It is easy to complain and to say `we have the answers and we have a plan.' Recent examples highlight Labor's failures. DuPont's closure of the apparel division in my electorate is an example of this. It took over the Bayswater plant in 1990. As has been already stated in this House, it was an agreement between the company and the Commonwealth. At the time the member for Hotham said, in a press release on 20 June 1990:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia can play a central role in Du Pont's aggressive strategy to increase its presence in the Asia Pacific&hyphen;region.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">But what have we seen this week? Where has the insecurity come from? Did Labor's actions and policies in government provide the security that Labor now demands? Mr Crean said in the same press release:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In summary, Du Pont will make a considerable new investment yielding a much larger, more export&hyphen; 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7301"> oriented business which will operate in a zero&hyphen;tariff, zero&hyphen;bounty environment.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">If they have operated, why aren't they still operating?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mr Crean interjecting</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ6">Mr BARRESI</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Oh, okay, we have a cut&hyphen;off time. You can operate until here but you cannot operate after that. Labor's feeling is `Throw money at them; throw another $40 million.' The only thing you create by throwing money at them is a false dawn for the workers at DuPont and the TCF industries. We all know that industry needs more than just simply money thrown at it. This government unlike the opposition, takes a multifaceted approach to helping industry. It is not simply a matter of throwing money. It is also a matter of addressing the other fundamentals that go with it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say this for a reason. I spoke to DuPont. Yes, I spoke to the general managers and I spoke to John Foote, the Managing Director. In my conversations they certainly cite such things as the volume capacity in their industry. When you have a site that can produce only 5,000 tonnes compared with a similar site with a capacity for 50,000 tonnes in Taiwan it becomes a commercial decision. This decision by DuPont was purely commercial. To reiterate that, in a press release today Mr Foote said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Foote reiterated that the announcement to close his nylon apparel assets by March 1998 was based on a major review of the company's nylon manufacturing capacity worldwide . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They took a global decision. Why did they do that? They did that because their customer base in this country has reduced. Why has the customer base in this country reduced? Because of the former Labor government's policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do not throw the problem onto us. Do not say it was our policy. If the marketplace has shrunk in this country it is due to your policies since 1987 under the Button plan. So I say to those workers, `Send your letters to Crean. Ask for Crean's apology. Next time he stands on that truck and says, "I'm with you, I'm here to protect you,"  you say, "Apologise first for what you have done to our industry. Apologise for the fact that we only have two 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> or three customers left in this country whereas in the past we had a lot more. Apologise for that."'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I look forward to DuPont succeeding and continuing in Australia. I look forward to their investments in their carpet division and the security it will give to the employees over in DuPont. But let us make sure that we do not get duped into believing that the only way to protect our TCF industries is by throwing money or by changing some of the rules. Let us look at taxation reforms.

<PARA STYLE="Para">Earlier today the Senate decided not to insist on the amendments to which this House did not agree. While not insisting on its earlier amendments, the Senate did pass other amendments with the support of the government and the opposition. These amendments increased the number of below the line preference boxes for the territories, South Australia and Tasmania to nine.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It provides for overseas voting in this election in a manner similar to that applying in parliamentary elections, including the provision of voting facilities for electors in some 99 missions and embassies, and clarifies the parliament's intention that this bill provides for a voting system designed for the purpose of electing half of the delegates to the constitutional convention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to announce that the government supports these amendments in this House, which will enable the government to deliver in full on its election commitment to the Australian people to debate the issue of the republic.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Obviously the opposition is disappointed with the Senate message and the apparent outcome in this matter. It is disappointed on a number of levels. First, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has said that he wants to maximise participation in this process as Australia moves towards constitutional change yet now, by virtue of the establishment of a voluntary voting system by the Senate, millions of Australians will not participate in this particular process of election of delegates to the constitutional convention. The Prime Minister has said that he wants to maximise public confidence in the process, but how can anyone have full public confidence in a voting system that is voluntary and postal and thereby subject to possible abuse?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> We are going to see a ballot paper as long as your arm, a ballot paper that, for most Australian voters, will be rather confusing and rather unusual. So it is not possible to maximise public confidence in this process. What was wrong with having a voting system as per the normal method of election in Australian democratic process? I would have thought it was also disappointing for the Senate to pretend that this is not something of a precedent for voluntary voting in Australia. When 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is a precedent not a precedent? According to the Senate, apparently it is whenever Senator Harradine sanctimoniously rolls over on a matter such as this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this particular regard, looking at the Senate motion, if it looks like a duck, walks like a duck and squawks like a duck, it is a duck. This is a precedent for voluntary voting in Australia. There is no doubt at all that at the conclusion of this process there will be members of the coalition, members of the federal government, pointing, in their assessment, to the virtue of voluntary voting and using this decision by the Senate as a precedent in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the Labor Party, at the end of this process, the republic and all it stands for, the cause of a republic in Australia, is bigger than the process. The cause of establishing an Australian head of state who is an Australian citizen is bigger than these questions of process. The coalition would appreciate&mdash;and I know the minister would understand this&mdash;that the promise of a constitutional convention started out with the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) trying to take the republic off his agenda prior to the last federal election. This started out as a diversion, a political tactic, developed by the coalition to paper over the divisions in its own ranks. It still stands as nothing more credible than a political tactic in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the average Australian, they want a head of state who is one of us. They do not take for a moment the talk of the monarchists that the Governor&hyphen;General is somehow our head of state. There is one clear proof of the absurdity of that claim. If the Queen were to arrive in Australia tomorrow, who would be our head of state? If the Queen were to arrive in Australia tomorrow, she would be the head of state. The claims of people like the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) and his colleague the member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) that the Governor&hyphen;General is our head of state is clearly outside the Australian constitution and the practical impact of what happens when they are both in the country at the same time. The Queen of England is Australia's head of state, and that of course is something 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7305"> that is not tolerable for the average Australian.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That has been the positive issue in this debate that the Labor Party has always put. We just want a head of state who is one of us. We want a head of state who is an Australian citizen. The republic in that regard is inevitable. The constitutional convention and this voting process are clearly flawed, and I would have thought that with regard to all of these matters members would need to look no further than the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> of 13 August and the following report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the Princess of Wales frolics on a yacht in the Mediterranean with her new lover and the Prince of Wales showers his old one with baubles on her jubilee, the British are starting to think that enough monarchy is enough. For the first time, support for the royal family has fallen below 50 per cent in an ICM poll published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Guardian</EMPHASIS>  newspaper, and those still backing the House of Windsor are getting older. Asked in Britain would they be better off or worse off without a royal family, only 48 per cent said worse off. That compares with 70 per cent five years ago and 77 per cent 10 years ago.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That shows the absurdity of messing around with constitutional conventions at a time when the British people themselves are declaring no confidence in the royal family, this inappropriate institution for the 1990s. How foolish and backward does it make Australia look to be messing around with a constitutional convention when clearly the Australian people should be moving forward, by way of plebiscite and referendum, towards the republic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian people, in my assessment, have had enough of Di and Dodi shows, Chucky and Camilla and all the high jinks of the latest generation of the royals. It is an inappropriate institution carrying all the worst features of hereditary privilege and class distinction in our society. It is not our institution; it is a British institution which the British people themselves have rapidly lost confidence in in recent times.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The report which I have tabled concerns the proposed development of infrastructure on the Bradshaw Field Training Area, near Timber Creek, Northern Territory. Bradshaw Station is an 871,000 hectare pastoral station which was purchased by Defence in February 1996 as a training area for the Army's 1st Brigade. The property is about 600 kilometres by road from Darwin along the Stuart and Victoria Highways, and about 285 kilometres from Katherine in the east and 230 kilometres from Kununurra to the west. It is a huge property, about four times the size of the ACT. In terms of distances, the property is 150 kilometres east to west and 70 kilometres north to south.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1st Brigade is currently being relocated to increase the defence presence in northern Australia. The relocation will be completed by the year 2000. New facilities for the brigade are being provided under the $530 million Army Presence in the North project at Robertson Barracks, about 20 kilometres east of Darwin. This project was previously examined and reported on by the committee. The proposal examined by the committee involves the provision of:</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">The estimated outturn cost of the proposed work is $53.66 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee has recommended that the proposal should proceed. The closest large training area used by the army in the Northern Territory is the Mount Bundey training area. This is located 120 kilometres south-east of Darwin and comprises 114,000 hectares. Whilst twice the size of the Puckapunyal range, its size is inadequate for the 1st Brigade to manoeuvre and undertake live firing. For this reason, Defence acquired Bradshaw.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The infrastructure on Bradshaw is limited and intended only to support the operation of a remote cattle property. The committee concluded that the Bradshaw property lacks the necessary infrastructure to enable training at brigade strength to be undertaken and that there is a need to develop the necessary infrastructure to allow subunits, units and formations to conduct collective and joint training in live fire and manoeuvre activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After defining user requirements for the property, Defence examined a series of development alternatives. These ranged from a `do nothing' approach to full infrastructure development. Bearing in mind that 1st Brigade will be totally relocated to Darwin by 2000, the committee agreed with Defence that the most appropriate alternative would be full infrastructure development comprising access and training support facilities to meet Defence requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee concluded that the proposed facilities will provide the infrastructure to permit and support cost-effective and realistic training for Australian Defence Force units stationed or deployed for training in the north. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> The infrastructure to be provided is necessary to ensure the long&hyphen;term operational and environmental viability of the Bradshaw Field Training Area as a manoeuvre and live fire training area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report briefly mentions the Defence record in the environmental management of its training areas. For example, the restoration of the seriously degraded Puckapunyal Training Area in Victoria which has taken place over three decades has, according to Defence, produced a remarkable result. Puckapunyal was formerly seriously degraded by previous grazing, heavy traffic and constant use during the Second World War. The area is now recognised as a model of restoration and environmental management and the committee commends Defence for its environmental management policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Northern Territory government expressed strong support for the proposal at the public hearing and in a written submission. The government commended Defence in being transparent and consultative in its planning and development processes. As part of its inquiry, the committee convened a public meeting at Timber Creek. It was evident to everyone that the proposed development has the strong support of the local community.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R254">Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Family and Other Measures) Bill 1997</XREF>  is a very important bill which gives effect to a number of measures announced in the last two budgets and a number of non&hyphen;budget measures which will assist in more effective and efficient social security administration and, importantly, facilitate the introduction of a maternity immunisation allowance which forms part of the government's seven&hyphen;point strategy to improve the rate of child immunisation in Australia. I would like to deal with the general matters of the bill first&mdash;they are very important issues&mdash;but then deal in the main in my contribution today with the immunisation agenda.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, to a matter which I have had to deal with on a number of occasions as the member for Moreton on behalf of the people in my electorate&mdash;it is a simple measure which the previous government ignored and which this Howard government is fixing&mdash;namely, under current arrangements, family payments above a minimum rate can be paid for up to 13 weeks when one or both parents go overseas temporarily, providing the child stays in Australia. However, if the child goes overseas, family payment above the minimum rate is not paid and families currently receive only the minimum rate of family payment. This can certainly cause a family financial stress. It is a silly law, and it is now being changed as a result of this bill. It will provide a greater deal of certainty for those in my electorate 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and all around the country who may leave the nation temporarily.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another 1997&hyphen;98 budget measure included in this bill will allow the better targeting of family payment and maternity allowance to those in need. As qualification for a maternity allowance is based on qualification for family payment, those families who do not receive family payment because of this initiative will also not qualify for maternity allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of non&hyphen;budget measures included in this bill are aimed at ensuring more equitable and efficient delivery of services to families. A number of other non&hyphen;budget measures included in this bill deal with disability related payments. Two such measures provide for the introduction of revised impairment tables for disability support pension and the subsuming of the disability wage supplement into a disability support pension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, I would like to deal in particular with a very important issue, particularly in Queensland at the moment, where there is evidence of 145 cases of whooping cough at the moment. The issue I want to deal with is the matter of the immunisation of our nation's children. This bill provides for a key part of the government's seven&hyphen;point strategy to improve our quite appalling immunisation record in recent years by the introduction of a maternity immunisation allowance. This allowance will be payable in respect of children born on or after 1 January 1998 who, having reached 18 months of age, have received age appropriate immunisation up to that stage, unless the child is otherwise exempt from that particular requirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This new maternity immunisation allowance of $200 will be payable in addition to the maternity allowance of $750 payable following the birth of such a child. This allowance will also be paid in addition to the maternity allowance in respect of stillborn children or children who die before reaching 18 months of age. A maternity allowance&mdash;currently $870.30&mdash;will continue to be payable following the birth of a child who is born on or after 1 February 1996 but before 1 January 1998. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7308">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure all in this place would agree&mdash;and certainly judging by the debate to this stage it is the case all in this place would agree with this proposal&mdash;it is a carrot to those who have perhaps believed they cannot afford to immunise their children. It may not encourage those who quite irresponsibly exercise some philosophical belief they should not immunise their children and that these particular diseases immunisation is designed to eradicate are no longer a problem here in Australia&mdash;but, quite simply, in Queensland at the moment we know 145 children are coughing and spluttering and shaking and hurting because of whooping cough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, if you have seen the television advertisements currently showing on the television, which is another part of the government strategy to boost immunisation numbers, I am sure you would agree whooping cough is a horrible ailment. As a father of two, it really does upset me to think some parents could have, for quite erroneous reasons, failed to immunise their children and allowed them to contract this disease.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps worse, their failure to immunise their own children has meant other children have contracted these diseases&mdash;others who may not have originally been the carriers of a disease but have caught it through the obvious means kids catch things. I really do question the commonsense of some of those who can afford to immunise and yet choose not to, and all too often, as I said, the penalty for failing to is a cost borne by innocent children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some believe diseases like diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough just simply do not exist in Australia and, because we are our island state, these diseases are now eradicated. I heard the honourable member for Longman (Mr Brough) contribute the story about his own father, whom I have known for a long time. To know the honourable member's father was a childhood polio sufferer, I can certainly understand and empathise with the member's desire to never allow his own children or those who are close to him to ever suffer what his own father has.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If parents choose not to immunise, I believe we should see some sort of penalty paid by 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> these parents towards the additional cost of health care borne by the general community. Let us face it: children who do contract these diseases require so much support and so much help, and they are getting support and help in Queensland hospitals at the moment, yet this is borne out of the basic health system which we all contribute to as taxpayers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It disappoints me to think that evidence of the decline in the level of immunisation has been very obvious for almost a decade in this country and the previous government did not respond and did not do anything, but I do not want to tarnish the support coming from the other side by criticising them for their past mistakes. I praise them for their support for this measure, and I think it is best to move on from today and into the future rather than harp on the past. Some in this place might think it is an unusual generosity, but I will extend it nevertheless.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, the epidemic of whooping cough in Queensland is one which health authorities are dealing with and coping with. The Queensland Minister for Health, Mike Horan, says it is an epidemic and a real worry to all parents of young children. I know someone who is about to give birth over the next few days to a child and I am sure the people close to this person must be thinking very much so about what sort of an environment the child is being born into and how important immunisation is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have recently distributed to my electorate a special report about immunisation which folds into a wall chart so parents can map the growth of their child, and also it provides quality information and prompts on when it is an appropriate time to immunise and also a record of the immunisation. In the process of delivering this to child&hyphen;care centres, pharmacies and doctors in my electorate, a number of child&hyphen;care centre operators said, in one case, none of their children were not immunised; in another, a couple were; and, in a few others, perhaps a dozen or so were. They also shared my concern for those who were not and the potential effect they had on the general community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whooping cough is a highly contagious disease caused by bacteria. It is spread by 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7309"> coughing or sneezing. It affects the air passages and it can cause difficulty breathing. The cough can last for months and permanent brain and long&hyphen;term lung damage can result. Around one in every 200 children under six who actually catch whooping cough will die. It is most serious amongst babies under 12 months. There have been 145 cases of whooping cough notified to the Queensland health authorities since July. This is 45 per cent above the figure for the same time last year. The July average for previous cases was about 101 cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only protection against whooping cough is to immunise against it. Last year 4,000 children around Australia had whooping cough and four died, 500 had measles and 2,500 had german measles. All those four who died were from New South Wales. People have perhaps forgotten what the children with these diseases go through and what the long&hyphen;term results can be for the children, their parents and the broader community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whooping cough is particularly horrible for a child and its family watching the child go through coughing spasms&mdash;sometimes vomiting&mdash;and the young child's contorted face as they try to find air. In the end&mdash;and it could last as long as eight months&mdash;a child could have permanent brain damage or lung damage, all because a parent did not get their child immunised. As for measles, one in 25 children who develop measles will develop pneumonia, one in 2,000 will get inflammation of the brain, one in 2,500 will get permanent brain damage and one in 25,000 will die. The disease is preventable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are arguments against immunisation, but the arguments are viable only for a few, and then there are alternatives. One woman recounted to me she knew of a child who had suffered a side effect from immunisation. I thought she must know a lot of children, because the odds of knowing a child who has actually suffered as a result of immunisation are very big indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I submit the actions of parents, being in an untold way quite selfish by not preventing something which could be very painful, have long&hyphen;term effects on their own children. No more than 70 per cent of children under two 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> years in Australia are properly immunised at the moment and 30 per cent of our children&mdash;one in three&mdash;are not. In 1989&hyphen;90 the ABS survey suggested only 53 per cent of our children were fully immunised; almost half were not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there is a generation of Australian children who were not properly protected in the way I know my parents made sure I was and, I am sure, all honourable members in this place have made sure their children have been. We certainly cannot continue to tolerate a situation any more where children are going through pain and agony and some are dying due to not being immunised from something that is quite simply preventable. I myself have two children. I certainly would not put my children, or want anyone to put them, through the agony and the possibility of disastrous long&hyphen;term health effects if it is at all preventable. Surely no parent would want this to happen to their children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it is happening in too many instances because of an attitude of complacency of `I'll do it next week' or due to a lack of education. Parents are putting at risk not only their own children but also other children by not immunising. In 1996 those four children who died of whooping cough in New South Wales all picked it up from other children. So who takes responsibility for this?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Education is certainly an important issue. Australians have a lack of awareness about the effects of the disease, what children should be immunised against and when&mdash;and parents obviously need to be re-educated. It is for this reason I and I know a lot of other government members have put out an immunisation wall chart around our electorates&mdash;to prompt parents in a very simple and straightforward way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No more important an issue there is than our children, and in particular the health of our children. They are our future. They are our responsibility. We in this place need to make responsible decisions for them&mdash;and for their parents, it seems&mdash;so our children are guaranteed a healthy and secure future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">New eligibility requirements will also be introduced through this bill for a number of other matters relating to the child-care cash 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7310"> rebate, which I will come back to in a moment. In the end, Mr Deputy Speaker, when you look at Australia's very low rate of immunisation, you have to ask yourself: what is different about Australia? Why is it here in Australia, compared with other Western countries, immunisation rates are so low?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the key areas of difference is because Australia has no one personal body responsible for seeing immunisation is complete, and the medical profession has long had this responsibility. The government is very, very serious about this matter, and I am hoping doctors around Australia will play their part in checking to make sure their patients are properly immunised. The government will be assisting them with this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I found a little astonishing was, as we circulated this particular wall chart I have produced, some doctors in my electorate refused to take it. I would certainly like to think doctors would like to be a little more responsible. I will not name the doctors, but I would like to think they would be a lot more responsible for the care of their patients by making available what basically is straightforward, simple and easy to understand, easy to read information. Doctors really do have to play their part and assume some responsibility for the immunisation status of the children they see.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge), in his contribution, in his announcement of the seven-point strategy earlier this year, forecast the use of Medicare data and the Australian Childhood Immunisation Register information just to let medical practitioners know which of their patients are not appropriately immunised. It is not a case of Big Brother; there is no new patient register; there is no need to change the information which is already available. But the information is there. Doctors should be consulting it. Doctors should be then taking it up on a one-to-one basis with parents to make sure parents are actually fulfilling their obligations to their children and the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government certainly wants to encourage doctors to help obtain higher immunisation rates. In fact, we need at least 90 per cent of children to be immunised, and doctors get 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to see children on a very regular basis each and every year. I do not think it would surprise anyone to know most children get to see their doctor six or seven times a year on average. Doctors do have a vital role to play. In fact, this particular doctor based approach has been very successful in overseas countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current media education campaign targets both the immunisation providers&mdash;the doctors&mdash;and the general public. The campaign is impacting; it has some dreadful and very graphic depictions of the results of not immunising. Hopefully, those people who do not know what whooping cough, measles and rubella do to a child will now understand a little better because those ads certainly do help set the record straight. I congratulate the Minister for Health and Family Services for his personal crusade on this particular matter, and I applaud the government in general for following through on his initiative in the form of this bill, which provides this additional incentive to parents to immunise. They will get the proceeds from this bill, providing they actually do immunise their children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will also be working with states and territories to try to implement consistent school entry requirements to ensure parents submit details of their children's immunisation history upon enrolment. As I have said, we do not need 100 per cent of children immunised to stop epidemics, but we certainly do need 90 per cent of children immunised to stop epidemics here in Australia&mdash;epidemics like the one which is happening in Queensland; epidemics which do a lot of damage to a lot of innocent Australians. These are people who cannot fight for themselves and need their parents&mdash;and it seems their parents need their government to prompt them&mdash;to act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is just so hard to believe we are actually having a debate on immunisation in this country; that we have actually had to go to the expense of providing an incentive of a couple of hundred dollars, as detailed in this bill, to parents to get them to look after their children. It is extraordinary we have reached this poor level of immunisation here in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7311"> Australia. Surely we could again have a more fully immunised nation of children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note&mdash;in light of comments from some people who come to this place from time to time and make contributions about disease and migrants coming to Australia&mdash;our neighbours, such as Indonesia, Vietnam and China, actually do a substantially improved job on the matter of immunisation to the job we do. Immigrants face exacting health scrutiny before being allowed into Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In light of this, in light of the facts we have before us, and in light of this bill we have, it is certainly most likely the case `imported Australians' are more likely to be without some of the diseases we have here in Australia which some born in Australia are now contracting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is very important because of the immunisation matters alone. It is doing something practical about our national immunisation record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the closing stages of my contribution, I would like briefly to address one matter which I prefaced before: there will be new eligibility requirements introduced for the recipients of child&hyphen;care assistance or the child&hyphen;care cash rebate. For the 100,000 parents enrolling their children in child care for the first time this year, there will be a requirement to provide proof of age appropriate immunisation in order for those benefits to be paid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All in all, the role the government has played in picking up some of the mistakes of the recent past and in addressing the complacency that has developed because traditionally Australia has been able to rid our nation and our nation's children of so many diseases is a good one and an important one. This bill is very important. It is a very important debate we are having. I commend the bill and its contents to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In speaking to this bill today, I would like to say that when I was four years old I contracted whooping cough. It was quite a difficult situation because it was at a time when I had my tonsils and adenoids out. My mum and dad told me that in contracting that I almost lost my life because I almost bled to death. In those days&mdash;and I am only 22 years of age at this stage&mdash;there was not a remedy for whooping cough, but now there is no excuse for that to happen.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Sorry, perhaps I did mislead the House. I am a little older than 22. Earlier this month the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>  reported that a four-month old baby boy had become the fifth infant to die from whooping cough this year. Sadly this boy, according to the media reports, was only two months away from being immune to the disease and tragically almost certainly contracted whooping cough from another non-immunised child.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The same was the case with the child featured in the immunise Australia television campaign. Again, seven&hyphen;week&hyphen;old Nathaniel Eason, an innocent child too young to be immunised, contracted the disease from another non-immunised child. I have not yet met one single person who has not been moved by the ad, where young Nathaniel struggles to breathe as he coughs violently. As a parent, I admit that I was shocked by the ad. You hear about the effects of whooping cough and yet, when you actually see what it can do to an innocent child, you really appreciate how terrible it is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Young Nathaniel was lucky: he survived. But this year in New South Wales alone five children have not. Like many government MPs and opposition members, I have been busy trying to raise public awareness, certainly in Townsville and Thuringowa, about the need to have our children fully immunised and to protect them from preventable diseases such as whooping cough and measles, as the member for Moreton (Mr Hardgrave) has pointed out.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7312">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Early indications are that the immunisation education campaign is having a very positive effect on immunisation awareness and on immunisation levels in Townsville and Thuringowa. Doctors and health workers have reported to me a sharp rise in the number of parents checking to see whether their child's immunisation records are up to date and bringing their children in to be immunised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rise in awareness has coincided with the government's launch of the immunise Australia campaign. The material that has been released in this campaign has been widely and warmly accepted in the Australian community. While this early success is very welcome, Australia's immunisation record will be something that we are all going to have to work at consistently over a number of years. While the ad campaign featuring the young baby afflicted with whooping cough has been successful in Herbert, it is only one part of the wider government approach to lifting Australia's immunisation levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also to be a restructuring of the maternity allowance for parents of newborn children to provide a bonus for ensuring that their child's immunisation coverage is complete. There is to be linking of child-care cash assistance and child-care cash rebates to a child's immunisation status. There are to be offers of financial incentives to medical practitioners as part of the better practice program to obtain high immunisation levels. These are just some of the other features of the government's immunisation plan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill provides for the introduction of a maternity immunisation allowance to be payable in respect of children born on or after 1 January 1998 and who, having reached 18 months of age, have received age appropriate immunisation up to that stage. An additional $68 will be provided to parents, taking the maternity allowance from an estimated $882 to $950 per eligible child. The maternity allowance is also to be made in two payments of $750 at birth and $200 at 18 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These immunisation changes are welcome, and they are an attack on childhood preventable diseases. They are good for our children and our families, they are good for Townsville and Thuringowa communities, and they 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> are good for Australia. Everyone would be aware of the phrase `prevention is better than cure'. Immunisation sums up that saying perfectly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cost of lifting Australia's immunisation levels back up to acceptable levels is insignificant in relation to the lives it will save every year. The cost of the program is insignificant in relation to the economic savings that will be achieved in preventing children from falling ill in the first place. With fewer children contracting diseases requiring medical attention, pressure will be eased on our hospitals and medical systems. The amount of money we invest now in our children's health and wellbeing&mdash;in raising the public awareness about the need to have our children fully immunised&mdash;will be repaid in spades in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill also seeks to make a number of other changes in relation to social security assistance payments, such as family payments, maternity and parenting allowances, and disability support payments. I would like to address the amendments to the disability support pension components first. One of the changes relates to the provision of a revised impairment table in determining a person's eligibility for the disability support pension. I note the earlier attempt to revise the impairment table and the fact that it has been taken back to a committee of medical experts for a second look, and I think rightly so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I am in favour of trying to get and encourage people with disabilities to get off welfare support and into the work force, I am mindful of some of the sometimes precarious positions disabled people find themselves in. It is not always easy for people with disabilities or impairments, be they major or minor, to find employment. There is a whole raft of reasons why that might be so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not being an expert myself in this matter, I will respect the opinion of the medical experts and the disability and welfare groups that the government consulted in reaching the amendments being proposed today in relation to the impairment table. At the same time, I would encourage members to keep an eye on the matter and ensure that people edged out of the disability support system are given the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7313"> ready access to other support measures and assistance in finding employment that they need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is often a fine line between the level of physical or psychiatric impairment required for support being approved or not being approved. It may be a fine line for those who administer the system, but it can also be an enormous chasm for those affected by the scale and system that we set. Having said that, I am glad the system will be changed from a percentage to a points system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My office staff has encountered a high level of constituent confusion or misunderstanding in relation to the 20 per cent impairment scale that has been previously used in relation to individuals. Any change that enhances public understanding of a particular measure is certainly worthy of merit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another change contained in this bill that is worthy of merit is with respect to the lodgement of social security claims via phone, fax or computer. This is a minor change, but as we all move further and further into the electronic age it is certainly one that is welcome. It ensures that certain payments can be backdated to when people contact the department verbally&mdash;for example, via the phone&mdash;and then come in a short time after to fill out the necessary application forms. In cases where people are having trouble getting to DSS offices in person, due to them being sick or perhaps incapacitated, aged or frail, this change can be seen only as fair and equitable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill also contains measures in relation to rent assistance for people paying rent for living in public housing&mdash;a situation that is not quite so fair and equitable. Honourable members would realise that rent assistance is not paid to people living in public housing. Public housing tenants already receive subsidised accommodation from the state and territory governments. However, as the explanatory memorandum to the bill points out, the situation exists where rent assistance may be paid to people who are paying rent for living in public housing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some people have suggested that in such cases people are effectively getting a double subsidy&mdash;cheap rent, with rent assistance on top of that. Certainly that could be one per 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ception. Another could be that a small number of people are trying to capitalise on the subsidised accommodation that the various governments provide in the first place. Whatever the view, I support the decision to remove rent assistance entitlements for people who pay rent for living in premises for which a public housing tenant receives subsidised accommodation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once again, the opposition is adopting a position of saying, `Well, we sat on our hands for 13 years, but now that the coalition is in office we want everything fixed with the wave of a magic wand.' The member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), who is here, offered no solutions in government and she is offering no solutions now. This amendment is not preventing public housing tenants from subleasing space to another person, be they family or friend. This amendment is about equity. I reject the assertions made earlier in this debate by the honourable member for Jagajaga.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another section to this bill also dealing with rent assistance but in relation to the family payment. A few problems have been identified with the family measures act, which changes to this bill seek to redress. The amendments will restore some people's entitlement to rent assistance as an adjunct to their family payment, an entitlement that was lost when certain changes were implemented at the beginning of this year. Other amendments will also be made to tighten areas where rent assistance payment could be claimed but should never have been allowed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will not dwell on these technical changes other than to say that these changes are just. If unintended changes have occurred, they should be corrected. This bill addresses quite a number of other amendments, but I do not intend to go into those at this time. I do support the amendments contained in this bill and, in particular, I support the changes being introduced in relation to the government's immunise Australia program.</PARA></SPEECH>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7314"> security and veterans' affairs, I wish to limit myself today to debating the benefits of those amendments as listed under schedules 1 and 6 of this bill. Schedule 1 deals with maternity allowances and schedule 6 relates to the provision of family payment when either children or parents are overseas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all know that children are our future. We also know that as a responsible and caring parent there are certain actions which must be taken in order to ensure that the children are looked after in terms of their safety and wellbeing. Some of the decisions we make as parents are not always easy but often must be made in the best long-term interest of our children's welfare. Immunisation is just one such example. The fact that children are still dying from preventable diseases in Australia today is extraordinary. As a mother and a former nurse, I find it appalling that only 53 per cent of Australia's under six&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds are fully immunised. This is a national disgrace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Surveys have indicated that around 98 per cent of Australian parents support immunising their children, but why has this not transferred into reality? Part of the reason must lie with the members opposite who, for the last decade or so, led this country. The fact that only 53 per cent of children under six in this country are immunised is partly due to Labor's past failure to adequately inform Australian families of the dangers children in particular are exposed to as well as a failure to introduce policy incentives that foster a change in attitude.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that so few children have been immunised is another sad legacy of how the previous Labor government failed to deliver real benefits to families. The coalition government believes that the health and wellbeing of our children is a national concern. This is why we have taken the decisive steps to combat the recurrence of preventable illnesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Overcoming the current complacency through targeted education campaigns is one such measure introduced last February by the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) as part of `Immunise Australia&mdash;the seven point plan'. Another measure is to provide families with real incentives in the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> form of a maternity immunisation allowance, as set down in this amendment bill, so as to encourage full immunisation from life threatening infectious diseases. At a 1971 seminar on immunisation, F.C. Robbins made this comment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is generally recognised that immunisation is one of the best and most effective investments which a government can make in the health of its citizens.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Schedule 1 of this bill lays the groundwork for such an investment through the introduction of a maternity immunisation allowance. It will be payable to children born on or after 1 January 1998. It is an additional payment to the current maternity allowance, which is payable on the birth of a child.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what does this mean in real figures? It means that a payment of $750 will be made on the birth of a child, whilst a further $200 will be made available at the age of 18 months after it can be demonstrated that the child has received the set down immunisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some people may argue and say that a monetary incentive is unreasonable or, indeed, not necessary. They may argue and say that it is the sole responsibility of the parents and not the government to ensure the immunisation of their children. In a perfect world we would not have to resort to a carrot and stick method of such financial inducement to ensure that our children's health is protected. But reality is quick to remind us that we do not live in a perfect world. It has, indeed, been widely recognised that children from economically disadvantaged families have low immunisation rates. Thus, the introduction of the maternity immunisation allowance may well act as a real incentive to these people to ensure their child's protection from preventable diseases is complete.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">`Immunise Australia&mdash;the seven point plan' acknowledges the role of practitioners and school nurses in improving the current unacceptable level of immunisation. General practitioners provide 60 per cent of all immunisations and, therefore, play a pivotal role in ensuring that their young patients are fully vaccinated from preventable diseases. This they can add to by advising expecting mothers of the provisions of schedule 1, which will be applicable in January 1998.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7315">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Childhood Immunisation Register has been introduced to assign responsibility to general practitioners for each child's immunisation status. The register has been designed so as to maximise accuracy and identify those not picked up on a national basis. In addition, some states&mdash;namely, New South Wales, Victoria, and the ACT&mdash;have school entry requirements which insist parents submit details of their child's immunisation history. Indeed, I know that when I had my children, which is almost 30 years ago, that was also the case in Western Australia. I would encourage my counterparts in Western Australia to reintroduce this measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the overwhelming majority of cases, vaccines are far safer than the diseases they aim to prevent. However, as with all other health care intervention techniques, immunisation is not entirely risk free. Immunisation may also be opposed by some people on religious grounds. It is for these reasons that we have made provisions for parents who, even after being fully informed of the obvious benefits of immunisation, put forth a compelling justification to conscientiously object. Nevertheless, the overarching message the government is conveying to families throughout schedule 1 of this amendment is that immunisation has the power to save lives and prevent serious illness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of us would have seen the television advertisement which, as part of the immunisation education campaign, shows footage of a small baby suffering from whooping cough. The ad is a disturbing but extremely powerful reminder of the tragedy that can occur from failure to immunise. Parents who do not fully immunise their children not only put their own children at risk but also put other children in serious danger of contracting a preventable disease, and the government has a duty to do all in its power to protect its people. Immunisation protects, therefore, not only our own children but increases the overall level of immunity in our community, hence reducing any further spread of infection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Illnesses such as rubella, smallpox and diphtheria may seem uncommon in Australia these days but they have previously been 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> killers on a very large scale. It is not uncommon for a virus to wipe out more people over a relatively short period than a world war battle. As Winston Churchill said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Science, now so largely perverted to destruction must raise its glittering shield not only over the children but over the mothers, not only over the family  but over the home . . . The longer you look back the longer you look forward: the wider the span, the longer the continuity.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I would now like to comment briefly on schedule 6 of this bill. Schedule 6 seeks to amend the provision of family payments to parents and children when travelling overseas. The coalition government gave a pre-election commitment to get a better deal for families. This amendment is yet another example of how we, the government, follow through on our promises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently, if a parent receiving above the minimum rate of family payment leaves the country temporarily, their level of benefit remains the same up to a period of 13 weeks, given that the child remains in Australia. If the parent stays out of the country for longer than 13 weeks, their family payment is reduced to the minimum rate. If the child accompanies the parent or otherwise leaves the country for educational, family, sporting or medical purposes, their family payment automatically falls to the minimum rate. This policy obviously has drawbacks for families wishing to travel together or for children who must leave the country temporarily to seek medical treatments or perhaps take part in school or sporting events.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Schedule 6 of this bill will now allow for the minimum rate of family payment to be made available if the recipient parent or child travels overseas temporarily up to a period of eight weeks. Affected families, as of 1 January 1998, will be able to travel on short trips overseas with their whole family or send their children away to visit their non&hyphen;custodial parent without suffering financial drawbacks, as experienced under the current system. Schedules 1 and 6 of this bill give Australian families a helping hand, the kind of helping hand Labor failed to offer during its 13 years in office.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our children's health and wellbeing are paramount not only to their parents and families but also for the future of this great country of ours.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is, however, very keen to facilitate a debate in relation to the Native Title Amendment (Tribunal Appointments) Bill. The government is determined to ensure that the tribunal operates in an appropriate way, and therefore this bill makes certain changes with respect to the appointment of the registrar of the tribunal. At the present

So this government is on record as recognising the rights of indigenous people, but it also believes that other sectors of the community have important rights which ought to be enshrined in the law of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Native Title Amendment (Tribunal Appointments) Bill 1997 includes a number of matters and there are two principal amendments in the bill. The first government amendment removes the requirement for the registrar to be admitted to legal practice for five years; rather, a registrar would have to be legally qualified, and that is certainly very important. The government also believes that it is important that registrars have experience in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander societies, or the law, or administration or any other class of activity seen as being relevant to the duties of the registrar.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Proposed amendments to the Native Title Act will remove the need for the registrar to apply an acceptance test to native title claims. Although a new registration test will be applied, and hence legal qualifications are necessary, it is no longer necessary to have the same level of legal experience. Qualification provisions for appointment of registrars in other federal courts and tribunals do not require an applicant to be admitted and practising for a period of five years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Traditionally, of course, the requirement for appointment and practice for a period of five years is something which has existed in a wide range of legislation, yet the government in introducing this legislation is updating the law and in doing so is recognising that, while it is very important that a registrar have an understanding of the law and be admitted to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7317"> practice, there is no magic in the period of five years of law practice. What the government will do when looking at appointing a replacement registrar for the tribunal is consider a whole range of activities, the whole range of experience, the whole range of abilities which will benefit the registrar in the native title tribunal area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second government amendment provides further clarification of when a member of the tribunal is considered to have a conflict of interest. It expands on the existing section 122 in the Native Title Act. It relates to the majority recommendation 9 of the report on the Native Title Amendment Bill 1996 by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title. The amendment will mean that members, except where the parties agree, will not be eligible to participate in any proceedings where they are or have been employed or engaged as a consultant in the previous 12 months. This amendment will address community concerns that tribunal members are and are seen to be impartial, but it is flexible enough to allow people experienced in native title matters to be appointed to the National Native Title Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important that everyone who has an interest in native title, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, pastoralists and miners, is in fact confident in the standard of treatment handed out by the tribunal. I believe that the amendments being made by the government in the qualifications of persons eligible for appointment as registrar will move very strongly in the right direction and will make sure that the entire Australian community can have confidence in the ability, capacity and competence of the person who from time to time is appointed as registrar.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is absolutely no truth in any suggestion that the government's amendments may be criticised as downgrading the position of registrar. Given the changes in the role of the National Native Title Tribunal, it is appropriate to review the qualifications of the tribunal to allow a more diverse group of applicants to be considered for the position. In other words, this government is determined to make sure that we have members and registrars of merit. What we aim to do is to have the best 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> possible people doing the job so that the Australian community will feel that they have value for money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is without doubt that there are some in the Australian community who have expressed very great concern over native title and over the way the whole debate has gone. This is why this government is absolutely determined to ensure that we have integrity in the system. This is why this government is bringing in this legislation to ensure that we will be able to select from a wide range of applicants for this very important position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some might also suggest that the second amendment included in the bill before the House today could be criticised for not adopting the full text of recommendation 9 which would mean that a member, often appointed on a part-time basis, could not continue to have any involvement in native title matters once appointed. The government makes no apology whatsoever for saying that we believe that this would be too restrictive and it would make it almost impossible to attract people with the most appropriate and relevant experience to the National Native Title Tribunal as members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is quite a small piece of legislation before the parliament. Unlike many of the bills introduced by the former Labor government, it seems to have only two pages. It is a very clear and concise bill, with two parts. We hope that we receive the endorsement not only of this chamber but also of the other place. I am very pleased to urge this House to support this bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to raise a case involving a constituent of mine whom I will call Sandra Smith, a postal worker. Sandra had a joint account at the St Marys branch of the Commonwealth Bank 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and was in the habit of having her salary and wages paid into that account. Apparently a payment was made on 17 March into that joint account she had with her husband which was duplicated on 27 March without either the bank or Sandra realising there had been a double payment. Sandra subsequently closed the account but still had a savings account at the same branch. On 1 August&mdash;some four months after the double payment&mdash;the bank took out of Sandra's passbook account the amount of $200 but did not notify her of the error and did not seek her concurrence to any action.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In pursuing these matters on behalf of my constituent, I have to say that my staff have been constantly challenged by the bank as to why in the first place we would make inquiries on her behalf and why we would seek to obtain any redress on her behalf. I must say that I find the approach of some of those banking officials quite offensive. I do not care whether it is the Commonwealth Bank, Westpac or a Commonwealth department, I see my duty as standing up for my constituents in all cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This case has a number of serious issues. Do banks, if they have made a mistake, have the right without a customer's permission to automatically debit an active account where a mistake has occurred in the closed account? I do not believe that they should have the right, even if they do on past banking practice. I know that the Banking Ombudsman&mdash;not so much interested in this case&mdash;is completely impotent in making recommendations to change legislation to ensure that my constituent should have been notified.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another serious element to this case: that is, when my constituent, having noticed that $200 had been debited to her passbook account, asked the bank to send her details of her banking record, all her details were faxed to a third party. This is a gross breach of privacy and a very current and topical issue. There is no provision for citizens dealing with private corporations such as banks to have their records treated privately. There is no redress in this matter. We do not have a privacy commissioner to ensure that privacy is respected and enforced, the way we 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7319"> do for Commonwealth departments and organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to say that I have written to the Commonwealth Bank and they have apologised to my constituent. They had no right whatsoever to do what they did. They claim that all the things that I complained about reflected breaches of bank policy. All I have to say is that, if the Commonwealth Bank do have a policy surrounding these matters to protect their clients and customers, then they are showing precious little evidence that this policy is being enforced by their staff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a number of other issues concerning my constituents and the banks. I hope that I will have the opportunity in a subsequent adjournment speech to raise these issues. I want to conclude by saying that it is absolutely outrageous that a bank can take out money for a mistake it made in the first place without notifying a customer. The issue is not that they should not be entitled to the money but that my constituent should have been informed and asked for permission to withdraw this money or should have been requested to make a sensible repayment schedule. After all, not too many of my constituents can afford to have an unexpected $200 whacked out of their account without notice.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="7319"><TITLE>Politicians</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Recent headlines on what expenses politicians do and do not claim, how much they are paid and how much they work have done little good to the reputation of our profession. It is no secret that politicians as a whole from any side of politics rate alongside used car salesmen in popularity surveys. These are statistics which, I am told, offend used car salesmen in my electorate, who never thought that they were that bad. The reputation of a profession, both in the negative and the positive, is acquired over the course of years, if not centuries. So whatever steps are put in place to salvage what remains of our reputation would be seen by many as too little, too late.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is a shame because I have come across many politicians from both sides of the House who are good people. They work much harder 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> than they have to and they got into this business thinking that they could do some good for their country. The reputation of these politicians matters to me. That is why I commend the initiative of the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Jull) to create a more transparent and streamlined system to deal with politicians' entitlements. It is an area in which we not only must be honest but also must be seen to be honest. The minister's reforms address that very issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> For too long the system has been kind to those who abused it, with people who were elected to act honestly betraying the trust of the people of their electorates or states and behaving in ways which brought little credit to any of us. It is clearly of great embarrassment to all good members, to their families and friends and to all those who know them to be honest and hardworking to see them associated with the antics of dishonesty of a few unscrupulous politicians. I know that many of us `recent arrivals' to parliament resent being tarred with the same brush as those who have shown a total lack of respect for the institutions of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My party has always done everything in its power to deal with the issue of less than honest conduct of a party member and we will continue to address the debate over the declining esteem in which all politicians are held by the Australian public. These are issues that concern backbenchers greatly. We are the ones who almost every sitting week look up into the public galleries and see our constituents looking down&mdash;often entire schools on their once in a lifetime visit to the nation's capital. These are people who, if inspired by the work of a dignified and hard-working local member, may themselves go on and achieve great things in the name of Australian democracy but who, if disappointed, may choose not to make that valuable contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although I support and encourage the media in its endeavour to expose dishonest behaviour among politicians, we all know that recent articles and television reports have damaged all politicians greatly. The school children from my electorate who visit my office believe what they hear and see about 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7320"> us. To be honest, they are never particularly impressed by our parliamentary behaviour either. They often ask me why we shout and argue so much. I often find it hard to come up with the answers. Some of my colleagues would say that it is all part of a robust democratic debate but I honestly think we can do better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the honesty of members of parliament, I feel that a greater level of transparency is an important point of departure. If our communities come to understand how much we earn and the hours we work, I feel they may be slightly less hostile towards our profession. As a backbencher I earn $81,170 a year, on which I pay over $34,000 in tax and contribute in part to the running of the car. Backbenchers are provided with an electorate allowance which they are expected to spend entirely on their electorate and cover major expenses incurred in running their electorate office. In my case, the entire amount is spent on the electorate. I do not use it to supplement my wages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I choose to bring such issues to the attention of the House for three reasons. First, to clear up the misconception that all politicians earn $150,000&hyphen;plus. We do not. Second, to state that not all politicians rort the system. Many of them have put their electorates before anything else. Third, to say that my work as a politician is based on a sense of pride that comes from serving my community and all of the people in the electorate of Gilmore.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the changes suggested by Minister Jull, hopefully such public clarifications will not be necessary. They will in fact become mandatory. I support such measures wholeheartedly but I am also of the belief that parliamentarians care about their reputations and careers more than rules and regulations. They realise that all it would take is one instance of abuse to bring all of their political ambitions crashing down. Exposure of all fraud may be in itself the harshest penalty around.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="7320"><TITLE>Youthsafe Campaign</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During the winter break, I was pleased 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to host the western Sydney launch of the Youthsafe campaign in my electorate office in Blacktown. The launch was attended by representatives from the Labor Council of NSW, the CFMEU, the Western Sydney Youthsafe Committee members, and students from local high schools. Youthsafe grew out of a national campaign run by the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission called Worksafe. This campaign was launched with the slogan: `Don't let your first day be your worst day'. The reason for this campaign was to create a culture change amongst young workers and to highlight their awareness about workplace safety. This campaign was extremely successful but was discontinued after the change of government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labour Council of New South Wales recognised the enormous potential of this campaign and therefore decided to continue to promote workplace safety issues to young people by establishing a youth occupational health and safety committee called Youthsafe. The committee is made up of young people from a diverse range of industries, such as apprentices, nurses, building and construction workers, clerical workers, unions, representatives of the financial sector and also high schools and university students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The major aim of the committee is to raise awareness about workplace safety amongst young people who will be entering the workplace. The launch was to help achieve this aim in western Sydney. The Labour Council of New South Wales has received great support for this initiative, including a sponsorship from Multiplex Constructions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been supplied with case studies of young people who have been killed at work. There was the case of an apprentice plumber who was killed while another was badly injured when they fell seven metres to the ground after a mobile scaffolding collapse. There was the case of a 22&hyphen;year&hyphen;old labourer controlling traffic who was run down and killed. There was the case of a 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;old apprentice who was electrocuted while working alone. There was the case of a 16&hyphen;year&hyphen;old apprentice cabinet maker who was crushed by pineboard sheets that fell on him. Australia&hyphen;wide workplace fatalities among 15&hyphen; to 24&hyphen; 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7321"> year&hyphen;old workers for the most recently reported years are: 1991&hyphen;92, 46; 1992&hyphen;93, 24; 1993&hyphen;94, 47; and 1994&hyphen;95, 49. But any person who has worked in industry does not have to rely on recorded cases; we can recall our own experiences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I experienced my first industrial accident while I was at school at St Benedict's, Broadway, Sydney, which was a technical school. It happened in the metalwork room. Two silly students started a sword fight with files. One file flew out of the handle and hit the other student's mouth, knocking his two front teeth so far back that he had to go to the dental hospital at Broadway to have them removed. When I got home, my mother was ropeable because her 14&hyphen;year&hyphen;old son had lost his two front teeth. Unfortunately, there was a sadder case than my own personal experience. While I was a union official responsible for apprentices in the railway, a similar accident occurred but on this occasion the tang of the file pierced the apprentice's neck and he died. So we just cannot be too careful, and industrial safety must commence at school.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to speak tonight on the Alice Springs&hyphen;Darwin rail link, but first I will make a few observations on the comments made by the member for Gilmore (Mrs Gash) on the public perception of politicians. It was only in March last year that, as a nurse in the area of aged care, my public approval rating was 86 per cent. I note that we have the member for Adelaide, Ms Trish Worth, here in the House too whose public approval rating 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> before she got elected in 1993 would also have been 86 per cent. It is a very hard thing to do in one day&mdash;go from 86 per cent public approval rating for your occupation in nursing to less than that of a used car salesman.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to comment on the public perception of wages. We do earn $81,000 gross a year but our net wages are roughly $832 clear per week, and I would have to say that I know many colleagues, as well as myself, who work very hard,  often from 7.30 in the morning to 11 o'clock at night seven days a week&mdash;not five but seven days a week. It was my son's 11th birthday on Tuesday in Adelaide&mdash;happy birthday, Graham&mdash;but I was here doing my duty for my country as a federal member of parliament so I was not able to be with my family. But it is a sacrifice that I gladly make to serve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said all of that, in the first decade after Federation Australia was in the process of nation building. The old debates between the various colonies were being settled or postponed for later years, and the words of our first Prime Minister rang true as we became `one people, one destiny'. Eleven years after Federation, South Australia was given a promise by the federal government for the building of the north&hyphen;south railway linking Adelaide to Darwin. This was in compensation for the cession of the northern part of what had been South Australia and which then became the Northern Territory. The potential benefits from a north&hyphen;south railway were recognised even in 1911.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Eighty&hyphen;six years later, I had the honour of being present when our Prime Minister, John Howard, announced that finally the Alice Springs&hyphen;Darwin rail link would be built. He was joined in the announcement by the South Australian Premier, John Olsen, who has a bulldog determination to fight for projects and job opportunities for the people of his state, as well as the Northern Territory Chief Minister, Shane Stone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The response to the announcement in South Australia,  particularly in my electorate of Makin, has been overwhelming. South Australians know how important this project is for the future economic wellbeing of our state. They know it means jobs&mdash;jobs for their 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7322"> husbands and wives and jobs for their children. They also know that for 13 long years South Australia got nothing from the federal Labor government led by Hawke and Keating. For 13 years, we were treated with contempt by arrogant Labor leaders. The Alice Springs&hyphen;Darwin rail link had no chance of being constructed while the likes of Beazley, Keating and Gareth Evans ever had any say in the matter. The only way it could be built was to remove them from office, and that is exactly what the people did.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister announced that $100 million would be provided by the federal government to assist in the construction of the rail link. The South Australian and Northern Territory governments will each provide a further $100 million for the project and the remaining funds will come from private sector involvement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The South Australian Premier has already announced the formation of the AustralAsia Railway Corporation board, which will oversee the submission process for the rail link. It is estimated that the rail link will create more than 2,000 jobs in the construction phase of the project and 200 jobs when in operation. It will provide our mining industry with further opportunities to expand, and has already led to an increasing confidence among the people of South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we move towards the beginning of the next millennium, what greater project could there be but to link our continent from north to south with a railway line that cuts right through the centre of Australia, providing us with a gateway into Asia? The future is before us and, thanks to this government and the Liberal governments of South Australia and the Northern Territory, that future is looking brighter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On behalf of the people of my electorate of Makin, I thank the Prime Minister, Premier Olsen and Chief Minister Stone for their commitment to this project. Let history record that it took Liberal and Country&hyphen;Liberal governments led by men with such tenacity and foresight to bring this nation building project finally to fruition.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to express my concern at the fact that small business are being misled by the government into thinking that a bill passed by this House will quarantine them from actions for unlawful dismissal. That is not the case. All that will happen is that a simple and straightforward procedure which focuses on conciliation will be replaced by much more complicated, complex and expensive procedures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For instance, clearly employees have had and continue to have their common law rights to seek damages for wrongful dismissal. There are a number of cases in which quite significant damages have been awarded, for example, Gregory v. Philip Morris, Wheeler v. Philip Morris and Giorgevski's case. Indeed, there is an increasing phenomenon, primarily in the United Kingdom courts, where the courts are being prepared to imply an obligation of good faith in any contractual relationship, including an employment relationship. They are determining that dismissing someone without complying with the principles of procedural fairness is a breach of that implied obligation of good faith and are awarding damages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The damages that they are awarding are not restricted to the 26 weeks which is contained in the Workplace Relations Act but they are awarding damages on an open&hyphen;ended basis, including things such as, for instance, nervous distress and psychological conditions arising from the real stress that can occur in losing one's livelihood. So small business, instead of facing the prospect&mdash;in my experience very rarely if ever awarded&mdash;of 26 weeks, will face, as a result of this government's actions, prospects of much greater awards of damages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, quite clearly the common law courts have the power to award specific performance of contracts of employment. For example, Lumley v. Wagner and Hill v. Parsons are famous cases where that has been done. That is the common law situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the jurisdiction of the Federal Court of Australia, the court has jurisdiction under section 178 to penalise an employer who breaches an award or an agreement. As 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7323"> part of that enforcement mechanism, under the Federal Court's original jurisdiction they have the power to grant injunctive relief to prevent a breach of award occurring. That is again effectively ordering reinstatement in enjoining an employer from breaching an award obligation where it precludes unfair dismissal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, the Federal Court of Australia quite clearly has an accrued jurisdiction, and again we have specific authority in the case of Turner v. the Miners Federation, where the court literally awarded specific performance of Mr Turner's contract of employment with Elcom&mdash;again, effectively the remedy of reinstatement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to those individual remedies, unions still have their general dispute notification capabilities under section 170HA of the act, specifically preserved even in the case of unfair dismissal. One can recall the complicated and complex litigation&mdash;indeed, in each case, litigation which went up to the High Court of Australia&mdash;in the Ranger Uranium case, the Wooldumpers case and the Vista Paper Products case, where the High Court found that an appropriately worded dispute notification established the capability of the commission to award reinstatement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All these remedies are horrifically complex, horrifically expensive and horrifically time consuming. But what small business now faces, if the government succeeds in having its bill passed, is this complex and expensive route rather than a simple, straightforward and conciliatory route which exists in the current Workplace Relations Act provisions.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="7323"><TITLE>Sri Lanka: Tamils</TITLE>

I have a sizeable Tamil community in my electorate and I have been watching the situation closely for the past 13 or 14 years, and all I can say is that what is happening there is a blight on humanity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The latest thing that has occurred that I have to bring to the attention of this House 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and of the Australian nation is the deliberate bombings and indiscriminate shellings by the Sri Lankan armed forces. The latest carnage occurred on 15 August, when two Sri Lanka Kfir bombers attacked a Catholic church, killing nine people, including a four&hyphen;year&hyphen;old child, and wounding 15. In addition to that, on 9 July 1995 the Sri Lankan government bombed a Catholic church in Navaly, killing 120 civilians. On 22 September 1995 Sri Lankan Puccara aircraft bombed a school in the village of Nagar Kovil, killing over 40 people, including 25 children. On these occasions, as well as the one on 15 August 1997, the killing was deliberate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a statement here issued in 1997. The source is the Tamil Centre for Human Rights reports to the 53rd session of the UN Commission on Human Rights, Geneva. These are official figures of human rights violations of Tamil civilians by the present Sri Lankan government over a period of approximately 2&half; years. They are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Disappearances 759</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Summary executions of Tamils 1330</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Innocent Tamils injured 2332</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tamil women raped by Sri Lankan security forces 33</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Arbitrary detention of Tamils 14,953</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I want to read into the record a statement issued by Amnesty International. I am a member of Amnesty International and I know many members of this House are also long&hyphen;time members. This statement was issued very recently by the international secretariat from the United Kingdom. They say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The level of "disappearances" in Sri Lanka has hit a new high, Amnesty International warned as the United Nations Commission on Human Rights examined the country's human rights record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Coinciding with the Sri Lankan Government's pledge at the Commission that "full rigours of the law will be brought to bear" on the perpetrators of human rights violations, Amnesty International submitted more than 400 cases of "disappearances" to President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga urging her to bring those responsible to justice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the security forces regained control over the Jaffna peninsula in northern Sri Lanka between late 1995 and early 1997, the total number of "disappearances" reported to the organization has reached 648&mdash;the highest number since 1990. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7324">  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"That more than 600 "disappearances" can occur in one year despite the government's claim that it is addressing the problem is outrageous. This highlights the need for action too be taken now&mdash;to prevent these violations from continuing," Amnesty International said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a clear pattern of the security forces resorting to "disappearances" in reprisal for attacks on the security forces by members of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). In one incident which occurred on 19 July 1996, the day after the LTTE attacked the Mullaitivu army camp, at least 40 young men "disappeared" after they were rounded up by army personnel in Kaithady and surrounding villages in the Thennamarachchi Division. They were allegedly taken to Navatkuli army camp but when relatives went to make inquiries, they were not given any information. Amnesty International fears that they may have been massacred.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There is a lot more I want to say about this issue, but I call on the Sri Lankan government to respect the human rights of all individuals, to respect the right that humans have to be treated as decent people and as decent humans in our society and their society as well. They have a responsibility to humanity, and these indiscriminate bombings of individuals who are innocent and not part of any war should be stopped and outlawed immediately by the world community. I call on the Sri Lankan government to allow the Tamil people of Sri Lanka the right to self&hyphen;determination.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="7324"><TITLE>Banking</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Again I am pleased to rise to talk about a case I have had about banking. It concerns Lionel Tipping, a constituent of mine, who was a 30&hyphen;year long customer of Westpac. If I described Lionel as a battler, he would not be offended. In fact I think it is a badge of honour that I should describe him so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A casual worker, Lionel was in receipt of a disability allowance on behalf of his daughter. He was notified in writing by the Department of Social Security that they believed they had overpaid him. Lionel, naturally, panicked about this and sought the best means possible of trying to refute the department's assertions in the letter. He rushed down to his local Westpac branch and sought to get statements of his account. It is not disputed that he was advised that these statements would cost 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> $7 each. He went home, relieved, knowing that the bank would get those statements to him and, in due course, he would have the proof that he needed to dispute the Department of Social Security's claim. As it turned out, the department made a mistake. He was not overpaid at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, a problem arose in that the cost of the statements that were sent to him amounted to, from memory, about $196. Lionel did not have that sort of money to pay the bank&mdash;certainly not in his account. And I must say I find the bank providing Lionel with an overdraft to meet these charges reprehensible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think Westpac has acted illegally. I do not believe they were legally and validly correct in merely advising Lionel that the statements were going to cost $7 each. Under the national credit laws, they are required to say not only how much it was going to cost per statement but what the totality of the cost of the statements was going to be. The bank, quite graciously I suppose, admits that they did not disclose the number of statements that would be involved&mdash;that is, the total cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bank offered to waive half the charges, provided Lionel would not, through me, go to the papers. I am pleased to report to the House that I have succeeded in having all those charges wiped. But I certainly encourage Faye Lo Po, the Minister for Consumer Affairs in the New South Wales government, to have her officers investigate this matter and even bring legal charges. It is quite clear to me, in the two cases that I have mentioned today, that either the banks are acting outside the law and need to be prosecuted or customers need to be protected by way of much more rigorous legislation to protect their rights and interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true that I contacted the Banking Ombudsman about this matter. I can only report that I found the Ombudsman's advice quite unsatisfactory. I believe I obtained far more benefit for my constituent than was ever going to be possible by contacting this lame duck Ombudsman.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These cases are coming through my door. I invite all my constituents not to put up with their treatment from the banks but to please 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7325"> contact me. I will take up their cases. On the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> today I have two notices of motion. One is seeking a parliamentary inquiry into the operation and effectiveness of the Banking Ombudsman.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Labor Party opposition will not be opposing either of the two bills. I understand that they have been split to comply with various elements of section 55 of the constitution. These bills empower the Australian Communications Authority to tax the spectrum licensees for cost recovery purposes in the maintenance and management of the spectrum. Members will be aware that there is to be a new system for auctioning and licensing radiocommunications. The fact that this is to be done within the spectrum itself rather than tied to the receivers and the transmitters, as was the case in the past, is a change which I think is a step forward. In many ways, these bills try to harmonise the taxing of the spectrum and, therefore, the Labor Party will not be seeking to oppose them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, we continue to support strong regulation for the spectrum to ensure that the public interest is protected&mdash;that, first of all, the public and commercial users of the spectrum know what their rights are&mdash;and that the interests of community broadcasters also are not ignored in making sure that people continue to have access to Australia's electromagnetic spectrum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make a few comments about some of the consequences of this bill and some of the consequences of the proposed auctions that are mentioned in the bill. Firstly, I understand that the Australian Communications Authority is planning to run the auctions by using an on&hyphen;line computer database with real&hyphen;time bidding. The applicants will bid for packages of spectrum which fit into a particular plan. Applicants will also be issued with software and receive training on how to use the on&hyphen;line computer bidding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One or two communications ministers have got into difficulty in the past in working out ways to allocate licences in communications, and pay TV of course is the obvious example. During the two years that I had the honour of being communications minister, we introduced an open auction system&mdash;an English auction system, I think, was the definition that was often used.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MG4">Mr LEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it was not the New Zealand model. It was a system like an auction for real estate. People would apply for the right to be bidders in the auction and they would have to meet certain criteria before they were given a paddle, allowing them to be bidders in the open auction system. Everyone knew what licence, what part of the spectrum, was being sold off and people could bid openly. I think the public got as close as possible to the fair market price 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7328"> for that spectrum. That is always the difficulty, making sure that the public do get a fair return from the sale of certain rights or access to spectrum.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The department has been keen for a while to introduce on&hyphen;line computer bidding, and I understand that it might have been trialled in the United States. I do not know how they judge the success of the auction in the United States, given that it is very hard to know how you measure the real value of something through different types of auction systems. I did have some concerns about how successful the on&hyphen;line computer auction system would be and I have to say that, at the moment, my inclination would be to stick to the open auction system. But it will be interesting to watch how this government and this minister go in taking the courageous decision to move to the new system for allocating this part of the spectrum. Of course, we will be watching with interest how those auctions go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the bands to be auctioned includes the 800 megahertz and 1.8 gigahertz spectrum. In debates in the past I have raised my concerns about what that might mean for the community. It is my understanding&mdash;and it has been confirmed by the Minister for Communications and the Arts, Senator Alston, in a letter to me&mdash;that the signal for these higher frequency communications devices will only travel a short distance before there are difficulties with signal strength. As a result, the next generation of mobile phones&mdash;some people call them PCS&mdash;will be using the 800 megahertz and 1.8 gigahertz system. But, as the signal will only travel half the distance, when companies purchase the rights to use this spectrum and introduce the next generation of mobile phone towers, to make that system work they will have to install twice as many mobile telephone towers as we have today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given how much opposition there has been to date to the existing mobile telephone tower network, imagine the effect of the number of mobile telephone transponders doubling: that has to be the inevitable result of the government proceeding down the path outlined here. I am not sure if the minister has explained that to his backbench, who I understand have raised a few questions in the party room about mobile telephone towers, but perhaps at next Tuesday's meeting they might ask whether the minister has written to the opposition and told us that, in fact, there will be many more mobile telephone towers as a result of the auction for the 800 megahertz and 1.8 gigahertz system going ahead. He has certainly told us; I hope he has told you.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was the first minister to actually give local councils the power to refer proposals off to the independent arbitrator&mdash;the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency&mdash;which I thought would be pretty tough on any proposals that generated controversy. I am not sure that the current system has solved some of the problems that have been raised in many communities right around Australia&mdash;in your own electorate, no doubt, as well as in mine. The simple point I am trying to make is this: imagine having twice as many towers as we have today! That will be the inevitable result of the next part of the plan going ahead.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point I would like to make briefly is that we all know that the analog mobile telephone network is scheduled to shut down in the year 2000&mdash;at the moment I think the date will be 1 January 2000. I know that the minister has publicly stated that he intends to keep some of that spectrum active to allow people in the bush the ability to continue to use their analog mobile phones after the year 2000. That is a commendable step. One of the reasons it is commendable is that, despite the three mobile telephone companies spending a lot of money on building the digital telephone network, the quality of the digital network still does 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7329"> not match the quality of the analog network&mdash;despite what some people say and despite Telstra's glossy advertisements on television. Especially for people who move around on the outskirts of capital cities&mdash;let alone for people in the bush&mdash;the digital system is not as good as the analog system is.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It does not work as well in your electorate, nor in mine. It gets very infuriating for users, I am sure, to have frequent drop&hyphen;outs so that people have to re&hyphen;call. Frankly, if the telephone companies are not meeting the promises they made to the public to provide a service of equal quality to that of the analog system, some tough questions have to be asked. If the digital network cannot match the quality of the analog network, maybe the minister has to consider whether he puts back that date of 1 January 2000.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The other issue that I think is worthy of consideration is the demand for mobile telecommunications services that will be generated by the Sydney 2000 Olympics, especially around the Homebush stadium and other parts of Sydney where Olympic events will be taking place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not sure if people realise it, but the Olympics in Barcelona were probably before large numbers of people were using digital mobile telephones with the ability to be used in other countries. As far as the last Olympics, in Atlanta, were concerned the Americans had, and still have, a system that is completely incompatible with every other country. That means, of course, the Sydney Olympics will be the first occasion on which the Olympics will be held in a country when people can bring their own mobile telephones from most other countries. People will be coming to Australia as part of the Olympic family, as I think it is becoming known&mdash;people who are brought along by sponsors, people who are involved in international sporting organisations or people who are coming to the Olympics just because they love to see the Olympics&mdash;from countries where, I am sure, they have mobile telephones that are compatible with the Australian system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since we will be the first country that is holding an Olympics with a mobile telephone system which is compatible with other countries, there is going to be a real risk that our digital telephone system will collapse because of the massive demand. There is going to be so much demand for the use of those systems that the system will clog up and, if it does not collapse, certainly it will be very difficult not just for ordinary Australian citizens who live in those areas but for the visitors to our country to ensure that they do have a proper service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I seem to recall that there are some technical limitations to how many base stations and how much additional capacity you can build into a network such as the digital network we have in Australia. I would expect and hope that Telstra, Vodafone and Optus are doing all they can to boost the capacity of the network around the areas where many of the people will be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, it is not just a matter of the people who are coming to watch the games. I think 30,000 journalists alone are coming to cover the Olympics. We certainly need to make sure that we are providing as good a service as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government is allowing the analog system in the bush to survive a bit longer, one option is that we might ask whether the government should also consider allowing the analog system to remain up and running in Sydney for an extra year to get us through the peak in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7330"> the demand at the time of the 2000 Olympics. That would mean that many Sydneysiders, who otherwise would be forced to convert from analog to digital by 1 January 2000, might keep their analog phones that extra year and there would be less pressure and less demand on the digital system. I hope the government might consider that suggestion and perhaps get some advice on it. There might be reasons why that is not practical and not an idea worthy of further consideration, but it is worth exploring.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following those suggestions, I repeat that the opposition will not be opposing either of these bills. We think that they further advance the reform in the communications area.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the contribution by the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) today to the radiocommunications legislation debate. The government is not afraid to listen to contributions from those on the other side and to take on board some of the serious suggestions that the honourable member has just made with regard to the Sydney Olympics and the potential pressure that could be on our mobile phone network. After all, Australians have had a reputation for a high take&hyphen;up in technological matters. We have probably the highest proliferation of video cassette recorders in the world and mobile phone usage, I submit, is probably way up with the top handful of countries as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there are going to be 30,000 extra journalists in Sydney for the 2000 Olympics, you can imagine about 40,000 mobile phones attached to them. We can certainly see that there could be additional pressure. As long as we are not going to impose on the Australian taxpayer, and the telephone system in general, an unreal additional burden to accommodate the temporary additional usage of phones, we should be looking at some mechanism to accommodate them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The matters here today are also equally important. Before I go on to the bill in particular, I want to answer a couple of matters raised in the debate by the honourable member with regard to telecommunication towers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things that Minister Alston has done since becoming the Minister for Communications and the Arts is to introduce and have passed the telecommunications legislation of 1997 which encourages the sharing of facilities and the sharing of towers. Whilst we have heard of the potential for proliferation of additional towers in the contribution from the honourable member, as a result of the changes which we made to the previous government's telecommunications regime there are more opportunities and demands for telecommunications carriers to co&hyphen;locate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The erection of towers is now a matter for state and territory governments and local councils to determine and no longer a matter that is directly within the bailiwick of the federal government. The carriers certainly do not have the immunities that they used to have under the previous Labor government's act. It is also fair to say there are many factors that may determine the requirements as far as towers are concerned, so it is not inevitable that we will see a doubling of the number of towers. The government has addressed a lot of those matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I only intended to speak for a few minutes on the bills themselves. I simply wanted to be associated with these new arrangements which are sensible and somewhat procedural in their nature. They are certainly straightforward enough and are not opposed by the Labor opposition. In fact, from the outset, they had their origins in a bipartisan committee suggestion in 1991 when the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Management of the radiofrequency spectrum</EMPHASIS> was released by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure. I am honoured to be a member of that committee in its current incarnation and I note the presence 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7331"> here this morning of the very effective chairman of our committee, the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have here is a government that is prepared to listen to private members' contributions through the committee system. Unlike the previous government, we have taken those suggestions on board and we have legislation here that is going to take those suggestions and bring them into law. There is a provision for an annual spectrum maintenance licence fee. As I said, the current government has shown itself supportive of the role of backbench members and that idea came straight from that committee years ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bills before us seek to apply and collect an annual spectrum licence fee and to recover spectrum maintenance costs from spectrum licences issued under the Radiocommunications Act 1992. This is not so much a new tax but simply a better form of taxing or charging or levying spectrum licensees who benefit from spectrum maintenance practices, including international coordination, domestic planning, interference investigation and policy development, carried out by what was known as the Spectrum Management Agency and since 1 July the Australian Communications Authority&mdash;the ACA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ACA does all those different jobs on behalf of all radiocommunications licensees, so it is appropriate for spectrum licensees to contribute to the recovery of the various costs associated with access to spectrum and the services provided by the ACA by paying a proportionate share of an annual spectrum maintenance tax. It simply is a user&hyphen;pays system and it is far better than the old approach which will go as a result of these bills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has never been a spectrum based arrangement until now. Equipment licensees have been the ones to pay these various maintenance costs. These bills will tidy up inconsistencies between the licensing systems for spectrum and equipment as well as ensuring accountability via transparency, so that spectrum licensees are well aware of the ongoing costs of spectrum management they pay. This is important because the ACA will actually determine the amount of the tax that is charged, which is presently the case for apparatus licences. While there is no set maximum limit on the tax which can be imposed, there certainly are checks in the system, including powers under section 235 of the Radiocommunications Act which can be exercised by the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an area of public policy which is highly flexible; it is dynamic; it is changing exponentially in so many ways. Spectrum licences can be traded, subdivided and amalgamated, which could lead to the possibility that a single licensee could hold a large proportion of spectrum in a particular band. The amendments contained in these bills enable all radiocommunication licensees to share the costs of the provision of an efficient spectrum management service in Australia by the new ACA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The two key things that people in communications and, in particular, in the media, want is content and also means of distribution. As far as spectrum, even for mobile technology, is concerned, people in the general media, the Packers and the Murdochs, see the role of mobile telephony and mobile technology as being part of the future as far as they and their aspirations are concerned. It is important that the government understands that a regime such as this is growing and there are all sorts of possibilities. These bills certainly provide that flexibility. Perhaps the best part about these bills is that the processes are transparent, they are accountable and there are built&hyphen;in limits on the discretion of the bureaucracy administering these matters. I commend the bills to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the absence of the minister representing the minister for communications in the House of Representatives, I will make a few brief remarks to sum up the debate on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R277">Radiocommunications (Spectrum Licence Tax) Bill 1997</XREF>  and the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R282">Radiocommunications Legislation Amendment Bill 1997</XREF> . As the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) pointed out in the beginning of his speech, the purpose of these two bills is to harmonise the tax regime of the radiocommunications spectrum to recover the costs of the maintenance of the spectrum.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we talk about the sorts of things that comprise the maintenance of a spectrum, we can think of things such as the international coordination of it, the planning of it domestically and the investigation of interference in the spectrum. The general policy development of the spectrum had until now been carried out by the Spectrum Management Agency, which from 1 July this year became the Australian Communications Authority or the ACA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a little concern, I think, that the agency has perhaps unfettered discretion in being able to set the amount of tax to be paid by users of the spectrum. This is not so, because any determination made by the agency will be a disallowable instrument and, further, under section 235 of the Radiocommunications Act 1992, the minister has power to direct the agency in relation to the performance of its functions and the exercise of those powers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Dobell also adverted to some likely difficulties with the spectrum around the time of the Olympics when a lot of visitors to a certain part of Sydney are going to be carrying mobile telephones with them. He made a couple of helpful suggestions and we will take them on board. This is probably not the first time that a large number of observers, journalists or otherwise, have gathered in a particular place seeking to use mobile telephony to communicate with their home bases. I can think, for example, of the Gulf War where many of the world's media gathered to observe that conflict.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My observation of that was that they brought with them the temporary capacity to transmit their messages to their communications network back home. I expect that they will have to do much the same come the Olympics because, as the member for Moreton (Mr Hardgrave) said, it is not entirely the responsibility of the Australian taxpayer, through the federal government, to provide permanent capacity for a sudden influx of such instruments into a particular part of Australia. But I am sure that that issue will be dealt with in due course both by the federal government and, hopefully, by a Collins government in the state of New South Wales.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make some very brief remarks on this report. It is the sequel to the famous <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS>  report and I commend the committee on producing this subsequent report with respect to this very important issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report reinforces the message that emerged from the original <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS> inquiry, namely that the operation of particular vessels in Australian coastal waters produces some very serious problems that Australia has yet to fully address. These problems include extreme exploitation of workers. Workers are sometimes bashed, denied food, put in outrageous circumstances, deprived of wages or, when they are paid, they are paid at an extremely low level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the horrific stories that have emerged with respect to the treatment of workers on many of the vessels that ply Australian and international waters are of great concern. They are Dickensian circumstances that in most of the world&mdash;certainly in Western world economic activity&mdash;were eliminated a long time ago with, perhaps, one or two exceptions such as certain types of outwork.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The prevalence of ships of shame exposes us to very serious safety problems. The reports of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority indicate that there are a substantial number of ships serving in the Australian industry internationally and registered in flag of convenience states that regularly have very serious safety deficiencies that inevitably, from time to time, result in disaster. These deficiencies are of particular concern not only for the lives of those on board the vessels but also, in certain circumstances, for those in the immediate vicinity if the vessels are in port&mdash;for example, the risk of fire could be a serious hazard to others, apart from the crewmen on the vessel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The environmental concerns are particularly of great concern to Australia as a nation. We have got such a vast coastline, and so much of that coastline is of extreme importance to our tourism industry and the broader environment. The Great Barrier Reef is an obvious example, but is one of only a number of examples.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In recent times we have had disasters, such as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sanko Harvest</EMPHASIS> and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kirki</EMPHASIS>, that indicate just how serious these threats are and the sort of damage that could be done to our marine environment and our tourism industry by a disaster involving a flag of convenience vessel: the possibilities really beggar the imagination. These are very serious issues for Australia. Thus far, in spite of the best efforts of AMSA, which does do a very good job in inspecting vessels and enforcing regulations, we have failed to fully grapple with the issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that context, as the shadow minister for transport I and the opposition generally have considerable concerns with respect to the recommendations of the recent inquiry which is still the subject of discussions between the minister and the various parties interested in Australian shipping. It proposes to abolish cabotage. This means that the extent to which flag of convenience vessels, and foreign registered vessels generally, will be able to operate in  Australian waters will be significantly increased because domestic routes will be opened up to foreign involvement.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7334">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So initially we have a concern that, as well as vessels engaged in international trade being a serious risk to the Australian environment and to workers engaged on them&mdash;and to the Australian community generally&mdash;we will have a situation where vessels of that type will also be able to trade in the domestic Australian shipping industry. This is of particular concern because in reality this amounts to the first introduction of guest workers into the Australian economy, something that is common in many parts of the world, particularly in the Middle East and in some parts of Europe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What it means is that foreign workers, paid perhaps $200 a week or maybe less&mdash;but very unlikely to be much more and substantially less than the equivalent rate for Australian workers&mdash;will be able to work in the domestic Australian transport industry. The fundamental flaw with the notion of abolishing cabotage is that you cannot really stop there. If you are running a trucking company or a private rail line or even a charter aviation company, and the domestic shipping industry is able to employ foreign workers at substantially lower rates of pay than the Australian award rates, then it is difficult to see why you should be discriminated against and why you should not be able to do the same thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The inevitable logic of allowing the open slather employment of foreign workers at a fraction of the rate that is provided for in the Australian award in domestic shipping is that you do the same thing for people who are driving trucks or driving trains or flying planes on the equivalent route because, even though there is a distinction between the freight task that is performed, there is a substantial competitive overlap.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That can be seen in numerous examples. In the choices that are made by people who ship cargo there is a substantial competitive overlap. So if there is a change in the balance favourable to shipping because it can employ people at much, much cheaper rates than the standard Australian award rates, the end result is that there will be a shift.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Others who compete with shipping in different transport modes, particularly in rail but also to a lesser extent road transport, will then be entitled to say, `If they can have cheap foreign labour, why can't we?' Australia has a labour market regulatory structure that applies to our domestic economy. Shipping between Australian ports is part of our domestic transport system, part of our domestic economy, and should therefore be part of our domestic labour market regulatory structure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In closing, I will just refer to a few of the recommendations of this sequel to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS> report, and I certainly would urge the government to pay very careful considerations to them. One recommendation in the report is that ILO convention 147 should be ratified by the government. I would certainly support that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report also recommends a detailed system of inspection for vessels whose owners are applying for single voyage permits or continuous voyage permits, which provide the flexibility in the cabotage arrangements and which mean a significant number of foreign vessels are plying our coast in the domestic trade where no domestic ship is available. This should only occur after a thorough examination and inspection of the vessel concerned to ensure that it is safe and that you do not have a serious environmental disaster or safety hazard to those on board or to other parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another recommendation is that insurance requirements applying to shipping be tightened to ensure that the protection for the Australian community is maximised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the committee for its work on the report. I certainly believe the government should take its recommendations seriously and it should not implement the recommendations 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7335"> of the Manser report with respect to the abolition of cabotage. I believe that would be contrary to the whole notion of labour market regulation in Australia. We are a nation of citizens who have certain rights and obligations with respect to our labour that do not apply to non&hyphen;Australian citizens, people who are domiciled in other countries, other than through appropriate mechanisms&mdash;through immigration law and visas and the like. I commend the report to the committee and to the government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make some quick observations with respect to the annual report of the Australian National Line. It is of some interest because the ANL has been controversial in the past few years, and it is worth making note in the parliament of its progress in recent times. It is vital to understand the background to the ANL's current circumstances, the history of the organisation and also the changing climate in which it has to operate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The genesis of ANL emerged from the need by our young nation 60 or 70 years ago to stand up for itself against the monopolistic or cartel characteristics of British shipping lines. In those days, of course, they dominated world shipping. ANL was a very important means of ensuring that Australia was not being charged grossly excessive shipping prices by British shipping lines. It was not favoured by the conservative parties at the time, because in many respects they had formal and informal links with the people in Britain who owned the shipping lines. ANL and its predecessor had a difficult task staying in existence because of the general opposition of the conservatives, but nonetheless played a very valuable role.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">ANL was also important in ensuring that transport links, particularly freight links, were maintained with various remote parts of Australia that at that stage were not served by adequate road networks: certain parts of Queensland, Western Australia and, indeed, across Bass Strait. It had a task that in a sense has been outgrown because of the development of other transport modes: aviation, road transport, rail transport and the like. Decades went by without an acknowledgment of that changing task, or the fact that these two aspects of ANL's origins were no longer particularly relevant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In recent years there has been a glut of international shipping because of the break&hyphen;up of the Soviet Union and the change in economic orientation of China. This has meant that the international shipping arena is becoming increasingly cutthroat, to the detriment of ANL. In a sense, international shipping is a gigantic international tax avoidance industry. All sorts of extraordinary activities go on there. The desperation for getting cargo and the desperation of seamen from Third World countries to get work, sometimes in the most appalling circumstances, have acted to shift the competitive balance substantially adversely to ANL and to Australian seamen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For many years these issues were not addressed, but they surfaced in a very stark way in the early nineties. ANL continued on largely unchanged for many years, but the impact started  to emerge in the early to mid&hyphen;nineties. To his credit, the former Minister for Transport, the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith (Mr Brereton) bit the bullet and addressed these problems in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7336"> 1994&hyphen;95. In particular, he established a new board for ANL which was charged with refocusing the organisation, turning around its deteriorating finances and reforming its whole approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly there were some significant question marks about how ANL had been administered in the period prior to the intervention by the then Minister for Transport. I do not mean administration by previous ministers, but internally. Some matters clearly needed to be addressed with respect to budgeting and dealing with particular routes and a variety of other factors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note that prior to dealing with abnormals, the operating loss for ANL in this annual report for 1995&hyphen;96 is $11 million. That is not necessarily a particularly happy state of affairs, but it is certainly an improvement on the preceding year's $19 million. It is interesting to note that Mr Kym Bills from the department said recently in Senate estimates that the 1996&hyphen;97 loss, which presumably we will have details of in the near future, is expected to be halved again. If we are seeing a pattern in a $19 million loss going down to a $11 million loss, down to a $5 or $6 million loss, at least it is heading in the right direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The changes that were introduced by the then Minister for Transport, the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith, much as they have been criticised both then and in recent times by the then opposition&mdash;now the government&mdash;are paying dividends. The organisation has been turned around. The necessary hard decisions have been made and ANL is getting back on an equal footing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even if abnormals are included&mdash;and it is interesting to note that this is the standard practice by the current minister when dealing with Australian National, our national railway corporation&mdash;the drop in the loss has been from $30.9 million in 1994&hyphen;95 to $6.3 million in $1995&hyphen;96. If abnormals are included, the reduction in the loss is even more stark.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to congratulate the new board and management of ANL for turning around the organisation over that period of time. It was desperately needed and quite clearly there is a major change in direction and a streamlining of the organisation that has actually started to pay dividends.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note that, in opposition, the current Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) attacked the Labor government for failing to address ANL's problems and for failing to do anything. He has been in government now close to 18 months and over that time his track record of doing anything with respect to ANL stands at precisely zero.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition has made mutterings about selling ANL. We are yet to see any action on that front and, in some respects, I hope that he continues to do nothing. Given his track record, it is likely that any intervention on his part will actually make things worse. As things stand at the moment, the board and management are getting the organisation back on track to a point where it does have some future, albeit as a niche player and potentially, I suspect, as a player in alliance with a larger international shipping company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suspect that the ultimate pattern that will emerge in international shipping is going to reflect what is happening in international aviation, where you will see alliances emerge, based on particular market strengths, between larger and smaller players. It would certainly be logical for ANL to become a niche player that is connected with a larger international shipping company, so that some of the problems that ANL has with backloading, for example, because  of the configuration of our exports and imports being so different, can potentially be addressed as a result of arrangements with other allies in the shipping industry.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7337">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do have to concede that ANL's future is very much problematic because of its size. I met with leaders of the Chinese shipping company, Cosco, or its manifestation in Australia, Five Star Shipping, late last year&mdash;from memory. In complete innocence, they asked me how many ships our national shipping line had and told me how many ships their national shipping line had. My answer to their question was six, I think, at the time. Their answer to me was 868 which is a good indication of the difficulty that ANL faces in the international shipping arena, when it has got players of that size competing against it. It has clearly only got a niche role to play. Nonetheless, there are significant possibilities there that I think we should be exploring.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the report to the committee and commend the management, staff and workers of ANL and the new board for having achieved a very substantial improvement over the last year or two. I trust that that improvement will continue.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fundamentally, the reason disciplinary action has not taken place is that the people who were involved in the field were not able to fully exercise the delegations available to them under the act. While employed, the airworthiness surveyors would identify a breach, or a potential problem, and report it to their immediate superiors, but it was then failed to be acted upon. That is not the fault of the surveyor but the decision making process of management, and this has been the problem all along.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now allude to a perfect example: the hot&hyphen;air balloon accident near Alice Springs in approximately 1988. It is relevant to note that it was common knowledge to the department  that this operator continually flouted the regulations and that nothing was ever done. In one particular incident, it is alleged that the operator took off from the Alice Springs aerodrome 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7338"> and then nearly collided with the aerodrome control tower. The balloon accident in Alice Springs was one of the worst ballooning accidents in the history of the world. There were several fatalities when that balloon crashed. That is one of many examples of similar incidents that occurred under the past regime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now refer to my experience with my maintenance facility in Rockhampton. Since the minister has taken a grip on the industry and made positive changes as a result of his own personal experience in the industry, the people in the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, especially in Brisbane, do a mighty job. They are a credit to their office. I have had the pleasure of dealing personally with the airworthiness inspectors while setting up my own maintenance facility. They were most helpful. Their attention to detail and their requirement that every detail was met may seem to some a bureaucratic nightmare and far too much red tape, but aviation maintenance is one field where any lacks, breaches or poor workmanship can mean a complete accident and, of course, destruction of the aircraft. I commend the people in the Brisbane office for their efforts. They do a mighty job and they are a real credit to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The regulators need muscle to be effective, and the thrust of this government is to give them teeth. As far as I am concerned, the minister has done a mighty job in tidying up the industry. You can obviously see from dealing with and talking with surveyors, inspectors and some of the people in the senior management of CASA and, of course, airworthiness as well, that people are trying to adjust and trying to get their industry up to date and on track. I commend them. I commend the minister and I thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker, for this opportunity.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The statement on aviation safety regulation that we are debating this morning is an attempt by the Minister for Transport, the honourable John Sharp, to redirect the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and air safety regulation in this country. No&hyphen;one more than the minister has been aware of the failings of civil aviation regulation in this country in the past, and no&hyphen;one is more determined to get it right for the future. This task is important to all Australians. Aviation safety matters not just to pilots and passengers and those who live under the flight paths but, indeed, to the reputation of our country, to the security that we all need as regular passengers, and to those who need to use the services of the aviation industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regulatory arrangements are important to guarantee this safety, but it is difficult to know of a regulatory body anywhere that has been subjected to such universal disapproval as the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. I know it is not a popular or an easy job to be a regulator. No policeman has a lifestyle that is full of happiness and joy. They sometimes have to make difficult decisions. Sometimes they have to do things that are tough in the state or national interest, but everyone expects that those decisions will be made with a degree of compassion, wisdom, and particularly accuracy. It has been the incapacity of CASA to act consistently and reliably that has caused such concern. We need a regulatory body that is competent and that people have confidence in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been a sad reflection on the board of CASA and its administrators, particularly in the early life of this government, that they have devoted most of their time, it seems, to arguing with the minister, unwilling to recognise that he was determined to make changes. Some of the board members seemed to be more interested in protecting their own position than in ensuring the competence of safety regulation in this country. They have treated the government with contempt. The chairman is still in position, even though it has been made abundantly 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7339"> clear to him that the government wishes him to resign. There seems to be this interest in personal positions rather than caring for regulation of safety in Australia. This is a matter of serious concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the past, there has been a lot of criticism of laxness in policy administration and several serious air incidents in Australia have been attributed in no small way to the inadequacies of CASA. It has been an organisation which has a long record of discord and disharmony. The minister himself commented in the House, prior to becoming a minister, on the Monarch air situation. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The CAA has obviously fallen down in its prime responsibility to conduct safety regulation of civil air operations in Australia. It has no excuses. The CAA has been given the teeth. The problem is that they are not using them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Plane safe</EMPHASIS> inquiry chaired by Mr Morris, the preface is an appalling indictment of the culture that existed in CASA at the time. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The inquiry has been characterised by personality conflict, unsubstantiated allegations, a venom and viciousness not experienced by committee members in previous inquiries.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">A little later in the preface, it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report reveals a regulator at war with itself and under constant attack from vested interests within the general aviation and commuter industry.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is really a very serious indictment of what has been happening within our aviation regulator. It is natural, therefore, that any government that is serious about its responsibilities will want to act to ensure that something is done about improving safety regulation in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been change within CASA not only with the appointment of extra and new board members but also in the attitudes of the administrative body. I am not sure that they are all for the better. There is a determination within some elements of CASA to vigorously enforce petty regulations. In fact, one person, who deals regularly with CASA in these sorts of matters, described what is happening in CASA at the present time as `a campaign of administrative brutality.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">CASA seems to be spending a great deal of time on trivial paperwork offences&mdash;desperate, it seems, to get up the number of breaches that it identifies&mdash;but most of these are in such trivial areas that they are not a threat to passenger safety. They merely increase the score for the authority. I am told that recently they spent two days in court, after lengthy investigations, and achieved at the end a $400 fine&mdash;while at the same time there continue to be complaints about matters that really are worthy of serious investigation. I am concerned that the Civil Aviation Safety Authority is spending its time on trivial paperwork matters which, whilst they should never be ignored, are not fundamental to dealing with aviation safety issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also remain concerned about the quality, training and experience of many of the regulators themselves. It seems to me that, on many occasions, CASA staff are placed in the position of supervising the activities of people who have experience vastly greater than, and training vastly superior to, that which the regulators themselves have received. Flying operations inspectors get 39 hours training time per annum&mdash;vastly less than those who are actually operating in the industry&mdash;yet they are the people who are supervising the pilots and the aviation industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been many instances reported of supposed flying operator inspectors indicating breaches when in fact, on further scrutiny, it has been found that people were not breaking 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7340"> the laws at all. There have been issued many notices of non&hyphen;compliance which later had to be withdrawn because they simply were not non&hyphen;compliant. I appreciate that the aviation regulations are complex and difficult to decipher&mdash;and, some people say, self&hyphen;contradictory from time to time. But if in fact our inspectors are not able to understand them, how can ordinary operators within the industry know what is going on?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A constituent told me of an example of a flying operations inspector for CASA seeking to hire one of his helicopters but having insufficient recent operating experience for the constituent to be willing to entrust his helicopter to the CASA official. Yet, the next day, this inspector is supervising helicopter pilots in this country and assessing whether they are competent to operate. There are still serious problems in ensuring that CASA attracts appropriately qualified staff to be able effectively to do the work that is assigned to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is of course essential that the Civil Aviation Safety Authority have substantial powers. It must have the capacity to ground an airline if there are serious safety breaches. It must have the capacity, without having to wait for court orders and the like, to act immediately if passengers are at risk. On the other hand, CASA has the power to ground operators for mere technical breaches or matters that are perhaps of little substance; and that is a matter of concern. I am concerned that operators have their licences removed for trivial matters and are left incomeless and with no capacity to have their circumstances reviewed in the short term. Once charges are laid, they go to court, and of course it can take many months before matters are finally determined. But, in that period, the operator may have no licence and therefore will not be able to operate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that there is a denial of natural justice when a licence is removed and a pilot or operator has no capacity to have that action immediately reviewed. This is something that needs to be examined in the legislation. There must be a capacity for somebody who has their licence removed to be able to appeal and get an immediate determination on whether that action is reasonable. It is no good&mdash;six months later, when charges are dismissed in court&mdash;telling the man he can have his licence back, if his business has already been lost. This is really `guilty until proven innocent' stuff that has no place in the Australian system of justice and fair play. These are matters that clearly need to be reviewed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to refer to some of the other problems that are occurring and are regularly being brought to members' attention in relation particularly to the examination system for new pilots. In this area there are a number of matters of serious concern. Mr Bill Hamilton, the new President of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association of Australia, has written to all members expressing concern about the new examination papers. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It's pretty lucky that we have the expression "on a wing and a prayer"; because a prayer is exactly what you will need if you are going to sit for the IFR WRITTEN EXAM. CASA is at it again; bad organisation, poor airmanship and absolutely hopeless administration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the last year the IFR WRITTEN EXAM pass mark has gone down to as little as 10% of the candidates&mdash;Why? BECAUSE CASA IS FAILING CANDIDATES WHO OUGHT TO PASS. They are doing it with bad questions and bungling the answers in company with a computer marking reader that can't read the answers! This is no way to maintain safety standards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AOPA has asked major teaching organisations in four States of Australia and the whole sorry story is the same all over the country. Bad questions, ambiguous answers. Many of the flying schools said that the questions could not be answered by properly trained candidates.</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CASA won't tell anyone what the exam questions are, so we can only guess about what is asked but when CASA gave us an example of their questions, they can't even get it right themselves! 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7341"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He then referred to answers in the CASA <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Flight Safety Australia</EMPHASIS>  autumn 1997 magazine. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Four choices are offered as the correct answer to Question 7 and three of them are right (it just depends on where you are in the approach). How do you pick the correct one? Guesswork? That's great isn't it if your exam pass, or your son's or daughter's, depends on it. It is almost unbelievable&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And the letter goes on. So there are serious concerns about the quality of the examination system that is being provided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to refer to another example brought to my attention where a helicopter instructor was required by CASA to test his own son for a commercial helicopter licence. The instructor objected and said that this was completely inappropriate, but CASA insisted that he test his own son for a helicopter licence. That seems to me to lack procedural fairness, to put it mildly. Yet that was a requirement of CASA in the examination system. So we still have a very long way to go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Bill Hamilton in his comments on this issue made the observation:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am seriously concerned about the harm the Civil Aviation Safety Authority is doing to our flying students (Australian and overseas), to our foreign trade, to our own airmen and to our International reputation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We are working hard to attract to Australia people from other countries to offer them pilot training. In fact, we have some success in this regard. In my own electorate there are a number of student pilots training who are from Korea. But we must provide to the world confidence in our examination and our training system. We must be able to guarantee to the world that our safety regulator is as good as any in the world. The minister is to be commended on his statement and his efforts to try and achieve something worthwhile for safety regulation in this country. I fear we still have some way to go but I am confident that the minister has the determination to achieve a satisfactory result for the industry.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report on protocols II and IV to the Inhumane Weapons Convention is a very interesting report. It is something that I rise to speak on mainly from my experience in the legal field in our modern&hyphen;day Australian Defence Force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The laws of war have been evolving since the Nuremberg trials. In 1925 there was the first attempt to make some sort of international treaty or agreement on conduct of armies during international conflict. It was quite interesting that at that stage it even led to different treatment of prisoners of war when the Germans captured English POWs as compared to Russian POWs, because they had a treaty with England and they did not with Russia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nuremberg put paid to all that, and came up with the concept of a crime against humanity. From the Second World War there were some very obvious examples, universally accepted today, about what is a crime against humanity, but we are still working towards a closer 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7342"> definition of acceptable conduct during conflict. The protocols that we are discussing here today in terms of the use of laser weapons and the use of antipersonnel landmines are two areas in this evolution of the law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We run a very professional Australian Defence Force. They have a number of standards. Right from recruit training, they are given numerous lectures and training and indoctrination in acceptable conduct for a professional modern&hyphen;day military force. They are also involved in international conventions, courses and conferences, at which they spread ideas to other armies. Over the years of my involvement in this area, I have seen various nations&mdash;in our region, especially&mdash;adopting the laws of war. It has not only been their chiefs of staff: I have seen them gradually inculcating that right through to the lowest ranking serving members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is what is so important in modern warfare: the sense of professionalism and what is acceptable and what is not. The international treaties we are discussing today go a long way towards setting up that humane standard for everyone to follow during times of conflict, when a lot of ordinary intercourse or everyday life is incredibly disrupted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An obvious example of that is antipersonnel landmines. They have attracted a lot of coverage since Vietnam, when they were most effectively deployed, and subsequent to that, when the cost on civilian life came to be counted. That human experience has led to the current major campaign for an international ban on antipersonnel landmines. They are not designed to kill people&mdash;merely to injure them; because a military force can be disabled much more effectively if members are injured rather than dead. The injured are assisted by their comrades, whereas the dead are simply buried.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Antipersonnel mines have had a delaying effect in terms of restricting areas which armies must have personnel to defend. They could cover one flank with a minefield and set up their offensive operations on another flank. These days, in modern warfare with armoured personnel carriers and anti&hyphen;mine tanks and vehicles, it is very easy for opposing military forces to breach minefields. These days they are not even a delaying factor. Armies can move at pretty well ordinary military speed across most minefields with the right equipment. That leaves the mines behind after the conflict has moved on for agricultural workers, for children looking for firewood, for women and children and civilians to suffer the awful consequences of non&hyphen;detectable antipersonnel mines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many things can be done to deploy mines. The military has come a long way in the evolution of mines, mainly looking at the security of their personnel. For instance, mines can deactivate or self&hyphen;destruct after a certain time or have a time limit on them. There are all sorts of methods. Given the technology available today, you have to wonder at the strategic advantage of having mines at all. In 1997, they have very limited use, even as a delaying tactic at best and certainly not as a defensive military weapon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Red Cross has led the major campaign against mines. Obviously, they are left behind, after most wars, to pick up the pieces of humanity&mdash;the terrible injuries to the children and the amputees. It does not matter whether there are 500 mines in a field or only one. They all have to be surveyed and cleared. Australia has an incredible record in its UN operations in terms of demining areas in Afghanistan, Angola, Cambodia, Laos and Mozambique. We have also had involvement in Pakistan and Namibia and in the Middle East conflicts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our ADF's ability to demine areas has made a significant contribution to UN efforts in war&hyphen;torn zones and in the re&hyphen;establishment of law and order in those areas. It is a skill that we would wish our ADF personnel to retain. However, it is something that we want to take the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7343"> lead on. The ministerial statement last year on this matter quite clearly led the world on this and made a great leap forward for Australia in finally proposing these protocols.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The numbers of mines in the world today is something that really needs to be emphasised and considered. It would take something like 1,000 years to clear all the active landmines already in place. It will cost about $US33 billion to rid the world of all the mines that are there. For every 20 that are laid, only one is cleared. As many as five million new mines may be laid in any one year. It can cost between $US200 and $US1,000 to clear each mine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a massive social problem left behind after conflict. Although conflict is the complete breakdown of law and order, the ultimate objective of any professional army is to return to law and order, to return the established systems where there is safety and security for all. The use of antipersonnel mines in an undetectable and indiscriminate fashion during conflict has a horrific aftermath and a cost to civilians, who, quite clearly, since 1945, have not been the target of any attack or military objective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mines are incredibly cheap to make. They can be built in garages, fields or kitchens. They generally tend to be the preferred weapon of choice in underdeveloped countries. The time is well past for Australia to take a stand in leading the attitude to a professional deployment of military power. The statements by the minister to date have gone a fair way to doing that and Australia's ratification of these protocols heads that way, as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other protocol mentioned concerns laser weapons. As yet, we are still feeling our way in this murky field of law to come to some understanding and standards which will be considered humane. Man's arms race is certainly ahead of itself on this one. We currently use lasers to designate targets for guided bomb systems. What is the effect of those? What is the effect from that of now moving forward to developing the laser itself as the projectile rather than a bullet, with the terrible consequences of blindness or the aftermath on the civilian population in a conflict? This was clearly seen with the use of mustard gas in World War I.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Loss of eyesight and the subsequent consequences to society in dealing with the costs of blindness and retraining and reskilling people who have lost such a substantial part of their independence have already been seen throughout history. We must move slowly towards finding acceptable standards and uses for this technology that comes up every day from our scientists and engineers, who are constantly pushing back the frontiers of science.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is something that I feel very strongly about. I think Australia should be leading world opinion. Without the modern armies doing so, we have little hope of underdeveloped countries taking the same professional attitude to the deployment of military power. That has an adverse consequence on our military personnel when they come up against an opponent who does not comply with the laws of war.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was clearly seen in the recent Gulf War in the Middle East. The Iraqi military forces had used chemical weapons against the Iranians in their previous eight&hyphen;year war, but they failed to do so in the Gulf War. They respected the discipline of the forces that were there, in an acknowledgment that they would not use chemical weapons. A balance was achieved in terms of warfare that was conducted quite clearly within the bounds of the laws of war, the Geneva conventions, the subsequent protocols and all the other treaties that we continually develop in the international sphere in the hope of attaining some form of international  agreement on what is the definition of a crime against humanity. I commend the report to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to participate in the discussion of the report that I was very proud to have played a part in compiling. The fifth report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties is certainly worthy of debate here today and its discussion is a very important national as well as international matter. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Restrictions on the use of blinding laser weapons and land mines: 5th report</EMPHASIS>  is the name of the report. The joint standing treaties committee will next week table its ninth report in less than a year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say it was privilege enough for me to have been elected to this place to represent the good people of the electorate of Moreton. It was an unexpected honour to be appointed by the parliament to the joint standing treaties committee and to participate in a very important process, the deliberation and consideration of the international linkages that Australia has. Certainly, a criticism often offered to me in the lead&hyphen;up to the last election was that there were just so many agreements that Australia had with other countries and other entities around the world and that there really was no accounting back to the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a great credit to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to have embraced an agenda first put forward by Senator Rod Kemp of Victoria&mdash;now Assistant Treasurer&mdash;to have this treaties process. It is very important that the consideration of treaties and international agreements of all types is not just the domain of the executive or the foreign affairs club. We have been able to break through the obvious and natural barriers of the bureaucracy in the committee process to expose a number of very important issues to date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee's work range has included everything from tuna fishing through to the rights of the child, which is the current inquiry. This report before us is one that I was very pleased to be part of for a number of reasons. I will mention a couple of them. It helped me to keep faith, as a member in this place, with a lot of people who wrote to me prior to the election looking for some action on just this issue. People from Catholic Social Response, the International Red Cross, Amnesty International and others all have an interest, naturally enough, in the use of landmines. They are simply one of the most cowardly forms of weaponry used by armies around the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very pleased to be part of a government whose Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer), on 15 April last year&mdash;in essentially one of the first acts of the new government&mdash;deplored the use of landmines and stated very clearly Australia's position. As the honourable member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly) just said, we have a vital leadership role in our region, particularly to show countries such as Cambodia&mdash;with not just its killing fields but also its maiming fields&mdash;that we do not believe the use of landmines is good enough. I join with the honourable member for Lindsay, and I am sure others in this place, in calling on the government to get even tougher on the use of landmines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are simply horrendous weapons. They leave in their wake children, particularly, who, after conflicts, may wander into fields, into what would normally be productive areas, and trip over these things. They are not designed to kill; they are designed to maim. They were designed to maim sections of the opposing army because it paralyses an army. It is bad enough when a soldier is killed, but when a soldier is injured two other soldiers are then taken out to carry that injured soldier. There is at least a triplication effect with these sorts of weapons. So we now have in countries in our region children innocently tripping over landmines and losing limbs. The photos in this report provided by Dr William Maley are just too horrendous to contemplate, with large rafts of skin being torn off innocent children. Landmines have to go.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7345">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Landmines are quite easy to make. They are literally being made in people's kitchens and underneath people's homes. In fact, it is quite astonishing to note, and we received evidence to suggest this, that some of the very best electrical companies around the world have their components stuck inside some of these landmines. I am not about to advocate that we should be putting a ban on products that are also produced by these companies&mdash;because I suspect, in their defence, a lot of the materials used are simply cast off components that have been picked up by those who want to make these bombs and who do so, literally, on the kitchen table.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are everywhere. As the honourable member for Lindsay has alluded to, and this is contained within the report, antipersonnel landmines total 400 million since the Second World War. The US State Department has estimated that there are more than 85 million uncleared landmines scattered in 62 countries around the world, and five million new landmines are being laid each and every year, with a cost of up to $US1,000 to clear each mine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is evidence from the International Red Cross that for every landmine cleared 20 additional are laid. It would cost in the vicinity of $US33 billion to rid the world of this scourge. We are not about to get rid of landmines tomorrow. I certainly wished that I could have been part of a process that had got rid of landmines but I think the important part about this report is that it states very clearly the view of the parliament. I am glad to see the government is going down the same track. Landmines are dreadful devices and they should be taken out of the play, as far as the world is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is also important to note the evidence of Dr William Maley with regard to some of the ways that these landmines are quite deliberately being used. The last thing a retreating army does is to lay landmines in and around hospitals, schools and fields that can be used for food production. It is a quite deliberate and cowardly device used by a retreating army to inflict horrendous psychological and physical damage on the opposing side when they reclaim the land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, I was proud to be part of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties in the compilation of this report. I am very pleased that we have discussed this here today and I urge the government to continue its efforts to rid the world of these mines. Also, in closing, I wish to register my praise for the role of the Australian defence forces, who quite rightly maintain a small stock of landmines here in this country in order to train and to maintain their expertise in order to continue their important role in ridding the world of these devices. Australian Defence Force personnel are amongst the best in clearing landmines, and God speed to their work.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join the previous speakers in expressing satisfaction that this report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties is being given time for debate in the Main Committee today. This was, of course, a very important inquiry by the treaties committee. The committee was required to respond to a proposal by the government to sign these particular protocols, but it was also a very heart&hyphen;wrenching experience for the members of the committee.

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7346"> threat. So it is important to strike a balance between a desire to act humanely, even in times of war and national distress, and being able to adequately defend our country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is, perhaps, a reflection of the fact that these issues were difficult that there was a minority report. I think that this is the only report of the treaties committee that included a minority report and I want to talk a little bit about the issues in that minority report in my contribution today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have the benefit during this debate of having also at our disposal the government's response to the report. So we have the evidence of not only the six recommendations, but also the way in which the government has responded to these proposals. Whilst the government has not accepted all of the recommendations, I think the response has generally been reasonable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first matter dealt with by the committee was protocol IV dealing with blinding laser weapons. It needs to be emphasised right at the beginning that blinding laser weapons are still in the developmental phase and there is no evidence that they have ever been used in conflict to date. In prohibiting a yet to be invented&mdash;yet to be fully developed&mdash;weapon, protocol IV is dealing with largely experimental or unexplored territory. But it is recognised that this is a major advance. It is obviously far better to ban a horrible weapon before it is used than to merely respond to international outrage after it has been used in conflict. So in that regard this protocol breaks new ground, and it is very pleasing to note that Australia will be amongst the first countries to assent to this protocol.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the witnesses to the committee made the point that the protocol actually bans only the use and transfer of blinding laser weapons and not their actual production or development. So we could still see some degree of experimental work being done, although to no avail for those countries who have actually signed the protocol.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The risk with this protocol&mdash;indeed, with all rules of war&mdash;is that the despotic regimes who are perhaps less concerned about humanitarian issues, those who might be most likely to use these kinds of weapons if they could gain access to them, are the ones that will not sign the protocol. So countries that have a more responsible attitude are naturally concerned about the exposure of their troops or their people in wartime to a weapon that they have voluntarily chosen not to use. So, in a sense, many countries are adopting something of a defensive mechanism by saying that they are prepared to work on the technology but will not actually use it when the time comes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also no absolute ban under protocol IV on the use of lasers in wartime, merely on the use of blinding laser weapons. There has already been use of lasers in guidance systems, and I think there is likely to be a lot more development in that regard. I am not sure that is necessarily inhumane. Lasers provide considerable enhancement to the accuracy of weapons, and that is likely to make them better able to target a military objective rather than indiscriminately slaughtering humans. I think there is likely to be substantial further development of laser guidance systems, and that will probably be an advancement rather than a disadvantage. Australia has indicated that it will be moving to sign this protocol and to commit our country to its obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other area that has been covered has been the question of antipersonnel landmines. This has been a matter of considerable distress, widespread&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA> </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GT4">Mr TRUSS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension, I was about to commence some comments on the issue of landmines and the committee's report on amended protocol II, which deals with mines, booby traps and other devices. It again needs to be pointed out that this protocol does not actually talk about banning these weapons but merely talks about prohibiting or restricting the use of particular mines. The Australian government has responded in a positive way in relation to this protocol. Antipersonnel landmines contained in the Australian defence stockpile basically comply with the restrictions required under the revised protocol II, although I understand that the M14 mines would need minor modification if they were ever to be used in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 15 April 1996, the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan) and the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) announced a unilateral suspension by Australia of the operational use of antipersonnel landmines by the Australian Defence Force and that the measure would take effect immediately. It is important to note that Australia does not actually produce or export landmines itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government indicated that the suspension would, for all intents and purposes, be permanent. It would be subject to review only in the case of a substantial deterioration in our strategic situation. The Australian government is retaining a national antipersonnel landmine stockpile to provide a defensive capability in the event of substantial deterioration in Australia's strategic circumstances,</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee, as I mentioned earlier, was divided on the issue of the extent of Australia's response on antipersonnel landmines. The majority of the committee recommended that Australia destroy its stockpile of antipersonnel landmines, except for a small number to be retained for training purposes to ensure that the Australian Defence Force retains its skill. In other words, the committee was recommending unilateral action by Australia to destroy its stockpile, an action which I understand Canada has already taken. It would certainly provide a very strong lead to the world that Australia regarded the use of these sorts of weapons as unacceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was, however, a significant minority report which recommended that Australia should declare its willingness to destroy its landmines, except for training stock. It should only destroy the rest of its landmines once a substantial number of significant nations in our region have committed themselves to this course according to an agreed international timetable. The question arose as to whether Australia should undertake the symbolic act of destroying its landmines to demonstrate to the world that these weapons were regarded as unacceptable, or whether our assurance not to use them and not to review that assurance unless we were subject to significant threat is a more reasonable response.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say that, on balance, I come down on the side of the government's position. I do so because Australia is a vast country. It is a nation that is not threatened at the present time. Frankly, I doubt that our country will be threatened in the future. I certainly hope that that is the case. We need to do all that we can as a nation diplomatically to ensure that we retain a cordial relationship with our neighbours. But there is a possibility that our situation could deteriorate. Any prudent country will always plan also for the circumstances when it must  defend itself. To unilaterally disarm when no&hyphen;one else in our neighbourhood would be taking such action would be regarded by many as foolhardy.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7348">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also need to recognise that our nation has a very large coastline that is almost impossible to defend with traditional armaments, no matter how powerful our defence forces might be. Of course, we have the benefit of wonderful new technology, early radar defence systems and the like. But it is conceivable that, if an invasion was threatened, with the availability of the sorts of weapons that we know exist at this time, Australia may need to use antipersonnel landmines to defend itself from a military invasion. Such weapons should only be used in those sorts of circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a wide range of other rules in protocol II, and in the various rules of war, about the way in which landmines should be used. Sadly, it has been an ignorance of those laws which has been a part of the destruction and damage and injury to people in Asia and other parts of the world. The existing   protocols have not worked in many of those countries. Sadly, for the same reasons as I referred to at the beginning of my remarks, there is a risk that the new protocol rules may not work in those countries as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has made it clear that it regards the use of these weapons as unacceptable, and that Australia itself will not use landmines. The government has also indicated its willingness to look at the second part of the committee's recommendation, which was that Australia should prepare for consideration at the December 1997 meeting in Canada a proposal for the creation of an agreed international timetable for the destruction of antipersonnel landmines of all nations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This takes up the point of the minority report. Australia stands ready to destroy its own landmines, but would like to act in concert with other nations so that our whole region would be rid of these appallingly destructive weapons. As was mentioned earlier by the member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly) in particular, this is a weapon that is designed as much to harm innocent civilians as it is to stem the flow or advance of an army. Such a deployment of landmines is a clear abuse of a whole range of Geneva conventions, but those conventions have not prevented it from happening. They have not prevented the appalling injuries that were referred to earlier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we do need is a strong diplomatic offensive to seek an agreement by all of the countries of our region&mdash;indeed, hopefully all of the countries in the world&mdash;to move to eliminate antipersonnel landmines. Australia has indicated that it is prepared to act cooperatively with other countries in that regard. I commend to the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Foreign Affairs the proposal that they should pursue this objective strongly when the meeting occurs in Canada later this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, these two protocols have the potential to help make the world a safer place, to free the world of the threat of some of the most potentially and actually horrific weapons that are used from time to time in war. Australia has an honourable record in defence of our country and in wartime. We have been involved in conflicts, however, where the conventions have frequently been ignored. I hope that there will be international effort to ensure that our world is made safer by the elimination of these sorts of weapons.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government response to the Joint Statutory Committee on the National Crime Authority's report on organised criminal paedophile activity, which has followed the publication of the report in November 1995, is a timely one. It comes at the same time that the Wood royal commission has released the final report into its inquiries into paedophile activity and other aspects relating to the corruption in the New South Wales police force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was a sponsor of this particular inquiry, and visited the National Criminal Intelligence Service in the United Kingdom last year. I might point out to those who may not be aware that this is now considered to be one of the authorities for material related to research into organised or other paedophile activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might also point out that the recommendations of that particular report coincide neatly with the findings of the Wood royal commission with relation to the extent of organised criminal paedophile activity, and also some other aspects. I must say this, though: one of the things I would strongly object to in relation to the Wood royal commission's findings is the proposal to reduce the age of consent for homosexual behaviour to 16 years. I would strongly oppose that for a variety of reasons, which I might touch on later if I have time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most important thing is to look at the circumstances surrounding the release of both the report and the response by the federal government. The report came at a time when there was considerable debate and speculation in the community about the extent to which organised criminal paedophile activity was operating in the community. At the same time we were perhaps 10 months down the track from the introduction of legislation that made it an offence to participate in child sex tourism&mdash;some groundbreaking legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fairness to the previous Labor government, it was initiated by the Labor government, under Minister Kerr at the time, and has proved not to be a blinding success, but at least it has been available as part of the array of weapons against the sort of behaviour that most people would find totally reprehensible. Australians unfortunately were beginning to get the reputation for being some of the worst offenders in the cases where, because of our proximity to some of these areas of attraction, tours were being organised and people were visiting these particular areas solely for the purpose of accessing juveniles for sexual purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we made these recommendations, there were some concerns about the extent to which the Australian law enforcement authorities were getting cooperation from their counterparts overseas, in particular in Thailand. One of the recommendations was to look at beefing up the relationship, the liaison, between the Thai police and the Australian Federal Police. At the time, the Thai police had something in the region of 150,000 police officers but only four were allocated as liaison officers to the Australian Federal Police. Considering the amount of drug trafficking investigation and detection which was taking place, this tended to give the impression that they viewed the child sex tourism area with a very low priority indeed. In fact, there were a number of allegations&mdash;to us and elsewhere during the debate that gave rise to the child sex tourism legislation in the first place&mdash;that corrupt officials, corruption within the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7350"> criminal system within Thailand, impeded the investigative work of people trying to get to the bottom of, or trying to investigate, particular cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are now halfway through the term of the Howard government, a government elected to strengthen the role of the family in the community. Paedophile activity is very closely related to this. For instance, the statistics from the Wood royal commission show that 46 per cent of proven victims are assaulted by family members. Fifty&hyphen;four per cent of proven victims are assaulted by a non&hyphen;family member; of those, 44 per cent are assaulted by an adult known to the family. In this case, one can clearly see that there is a very strong need, a very serious need, to strengthen, not weaken, the opportunity for the family unit to be able to be an influence against paedophile behaviour. It is also a fact, not refuted, that many assaults are undertaken in the case of de facto relationships by a de facto stepfather on a stepdaughter. This is another area of concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what concerns me most is the fact that, notwithstanding the commitment of the Howard government to beefing up the family unit as the principal source of comfort, care, love and education in our community, there are aspects of government policy that are undermining and weakening substantially the opportunity for families to be able to combat the influence of paedophile behaviour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can give you a few examples from my own electorate, ones that have occurred very recently. Amongst some more recent ones was a case where two 14&hyphen;year&hyphen;old girls ran away from home. They met up with some youths in town, who then persuaded them to come and live at their place, which was like an open house, effectively under the control of a woman who was seeing a number of men. These girls moved there unbeknownst to their parents. They were believed to be participating in drug taking, in sexual activity on the premises. One of them ended up getting assaulted, their health suffered and their condition and welfare were seriously under question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The interesting thing was that, notwithstanding the fact that their father reported the girls missing immediately, the police could not tell the father where these girls were. The police would not act to bring these girls back home. Under the circumstances, I would have considered that to be entirely reprehensible. At the same time, the state department&mdash;that is, the family and community services department of the Western Australia government, another coalition government, I might add, in its second term of government&mdash;also failed to act, under the act which it has responsibility for administering.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we have the situation where the father appeared on the Howard Sattler program&mdash;one of Perth's popular radio talk back shows&mdash;and quizzed the Premier one month after the girls had actually disappeared. The Premier said that he would get the minister to act immediately on this. Within the period that the Premier was informed and the matter came back to my attention, one of the girls had been assaulted so badly that she had to have stitches around her eye. We understand that there were other men coming into the household and sexual activity had taken place with these girls, who were 14&hyphen;year&hyphen;old twins. In fact, when one went to a doctor's surgery, she collapsed from malnutrition in the doctor's surgery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Interestingly enough, when the woman that was acting in loco parentis, so to speak, for these girls went to the Department of Social Security in her local area&mdash;a federal department&mdash;she was able to get family allowance payments for the girls. Then the Department of Social Security wrote to the parents and told them they had to repay the money they had received as family allowance payments. Eventually, after contacting the minister, we got an apology 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7351"> from the minister's office for what is, in my view, entirely reprehensible behaviour by the Department of Social Security.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It gives an indication of just how serious the problem is. If a parent is conscious of their child being under threat or if the child leaves home before they are of the age of sexual consent, then they have little to no influence over that child's welfare&mdash;to such an extent that a government department would be very reluctant to return that child to the home, even if they were of the opinion that that particular child was engaging in under&hyphen;age sexual activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where we have the government yesterday saying that it wanted to do something about this terrible problem of paedophile activity&mdash;and it is a terrible problem&mdash;we have the situation where, within its own departments, it is in fact encouraging the very behaviour through its own lack of support for the role of the parents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other problem is: what does the government do under the circumstances? The government has responded to a range of recommendations made by our committee and in most cases they have agreed to them. In particular, of course, the most important of those, as far as the Commonwealth government is concerned, is in the circulation of information relating to the activities of paedophiles. It is quite clear that paedophiles, by their nature, gravitate to their place of opportunity&mdash;to the place where they can access their prey. In many instances, they move from place to place. You would be perhaps totally unfamiliar with the fact that across the road from your children lived somebody who may have been convicted for sexually assaulting children&mdash;who may have served a prison sentence and come back to live in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen in the United States a considerable social movement, a popular movement, to have legislation enacted by President Clinton to in fact make it mandatory for local authorities to inform the local community in the case where somebody with that sort of criminal background moves into the community. We have seen instances where people of that particular nature have moved back in and recommitted offences. People who were living across the road, or in that community, did not know because the authorities would not tell them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have this similar problem here in Australia, where, for instance, a parent, in anguish, goes to a government department, state or federal, asking for help to get their daughter or son away from a situation in which they are in sexual activity with people who are over the age of consent or adults&mdash;in other words paedophile activity. They cannot get any help, notwithstanding the fact that there is legislation there to actually guide them or to provide that power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a policy in the family and children's services department in Western Australia not to enforce it&mdash;not to return the child to their home. In fact, the policy is to take the view of the child if the child wilfully wants to engage in this activity. One of the reasons why I strongly oppose the reduction of the age of consent for homosexual behaviour is that it is a well-known fact that adult homosexual males prey on juvenile males in a way that contributes to the behaviour. In fact, many of them are more prosperous or they spend lots of money and do things to try and smother the person or to make the person feel comfortable or happy in their company and then use that to break down any perhaps resistance or natural concerns they might have about behaviour. It is quite clear, particularly when you look at some of the evidence that has arisen as a result of the New South Wales royal commission, that in fact this is still going on today to a wide extent.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7352">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I personally would like to congratulate two people who have done a good job in relation to their parliamentary duties in New South Wales. They are on the other side of the fence politically from me, but they are people who have taken a stand on it and have actually done something. I think that members of parliament have a duty to act where they feel that it is in the interests of the community to act. I refer to Franca Arena and Deirdre Grusovin, who were reviled in the media at one stage and then praised at another. They took it upon themselves to use their parliamentary privilege, something that is a privilege to all of us, to act on behalf of their constituents. That is what it is for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In both cases, in my view, they have been shown to have made a contribution. It is quite clear that, in the absence of action and in the absence of people taking it upon themselves to act, the problem has gotten out of hand in New South Wales and has given rise to this royal commission there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like also to make an observation in relation to the problem that we touched upon in our particular report relating to Cambodia. World Vision gave evidence to us in Melbourne that there was the very serious problem of paedophiles accessing World Vision child sponsorship programs, becoming a sponsor and then going to the country where the child lived and accessing that child for sexual purposes, knowing full well that in many instances, both culturally and because of their particular circumstance of poverty, the parents may well not resist the overtures made by that particular paedophile activist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have also been very disappointed over the period of time since the allegations were first raised about the role of Australia's mission in Cambodia in relation to paedophile activity because it is now clear that under the circumstances there was substantial negligence in relation to that activity in Cambodia, activity that the World Vision organisation brought to the attention of the committee at an early stage during our inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might also say that, unfortunately, the government says that it agrees that it needs to cooperate with countries like Cambodia. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Government has now removed the need to negotiate treaties in all but the most exceptional circumstances. While the Government is not prepared to pursue treaties with Cambodia and other South East Asian countries, it considers that the changes it has made to the scheme of the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987 will remove significant impediments to, and thus facilitate greater cooperation with, countries in our region in the investigation and prosecution of child sex offences.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It did say in its response that it felt that the liaison efforts of the AFP would assist. Unfortunately, in the case of Cambodia, when the allegations were made in the case of a member of Australia's diplomatic mission, the AFP was forced to do an inquiry here in Australia, offshore. The AFP did not even send personnel to Cambodia, and it did not give rise to a prosecution for some time down the track.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that the Australian Federal Police Association was particularly disappointed with the response made by the government at the time and by the fact that there was not an onshore investigation in the country where the offences were alleged to have taken place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I want to make the following point. Nothing that can be done by the federal government in relation to paedophile activity will succeed unless we give the family unit the opportunity, the support, to be able to combat the problem in the first place. I might say also that it is highly disappointing that some of the government's own departments, particularly the Department of Social Security, may well be contributing inadvertently to the problem in the first place.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting that this debate is occurring here today. I would have thought that there would be a list of speakers 25 or 30 long taking the opportunity to speak about this matter here in the Main Committee, given the current climate. I suppose it emphasises the importance of this committee to members. There are other matters on the agenda here today that are equally important in a lot of respects. The Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs report on youth suicide is also on the agenda. There are a limited number of speakers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In many respects this debate should be going on in the House of Representatives chamber itself because of the fact that it is such an important issue. I am not necessarily being critical of my colleagues, but somehow the processes and the opportunity is not getting through to people, and on this particular issue of paedophilia I would have thought there would have been a lot more speakers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Moore has a great deal of credibility in respect of what he has had to say this morning. For a start, he was on the committee during its inquiry and he is the only member of the committee who is still on the Joint Statutory Committee on the National Crime Authority, the committee which I currently chair. He was on that committee at the time that it brought down this excellent report, but more than that, as I understand it, he actually drove the committee on this report. It was his knowledge of this subject, as a former policeman, that drove this report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is really quite amazing that here we have a report that was brought down in this parliament on November 1995 on a subject that this day is on the lips of every Australian. In 1995 I think most Australians would not have been able to spell `paedophile', let alone know what it was all about. Yet today we have this debate not only following the Wood royal commission but within a couple of weeks of the report of the Children's Commission of Queensland to the Queensland government, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Paedophilia in Queensland</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to overdo it, but let me tell the parliament that the member for Moore has made a very significant and relevant speech here today and he deserves a great deal of credit for the committee's work on this subject. We are dealing now with the government's response to the report. I note that the government has accepted every recommendation made by the committee in its report, but this is only the beginning of a role for the Commonwealth on this subject, because of its importance&mdash;which, as I said, has been underlined by events in the last few days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think anyone would suggest that paedophilia is new, that it is something that has just started to happen. The evidence is that it has been going on for a very long time, but it has been one of those subjects that people have not wanted to talk about. It is not a very nice subject to talk about and I suppose those of us who have had some responsibilities and opportunities to talk about it have probably abrogated those responsibilities by not being prepared to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We now understand, as a result of events in recent days, the extent of this problem and, probably worse even than the extent of it, the actual nature of it, which Justice Wood spelt out not only in his report but in subsequent interviews. I think he was not able to say 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7354"> graphically enough some of the horrific and horrible evidence with which he had been presented on this particular activity. But the Queensland Children's Commission report makes the point, in relation to Queensland, that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The existence of a hard&hyphen;core group of some 300 active paedophiles in the State is cause for a considerable concern.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That has to be an understatement. The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When it is recalled that a single paedophile may sexually abuse on average 150 victims, an estimated 45,000 Queensland children consequently are destined to carry the scars of sexual abuse by this 300. To these figures of course must be added many thousands of Queensland men and women who, during their adulthood, are now also bearing the emotional and physical scars of sexual abuse as children.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Studies relied upon by the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence (ABCI) provide a basis for assessing the statistical magnitude of paedophile activity in the State.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These studies suggest that one in four girls and one in eleven boys are sexually abused by the time they reach the age of 18 years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Out of Queensland's population of persons aged 0&hyphen;17 years, some 150,000 will consequently carry the emotional and physical scars of sexual abuse throughout their adult lives. This number will augment the number of existing adults who in their childhoods were also subjected to sexual abuse. That number of persons now over 18 years of age in Queensland is of the order of 420,000.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When it is recalled that 70% of persons in psychiatric units of some of our hospitals are known to have been sexually abused as children, we can begin to see the true dimensions of the societal scourge which paedophilia constitutes.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That report came out on 5 August, just a couple of weeks before Justice Wood brought down his report into the New South Wales situation, which is equally as bad, maybe even worse. So we have a problem that is not only in Queensland, is not only in New South Wales, but, by any estimate, is an Australia&hyphen;wide one of enormous proportions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to say that the member for Moore is absolutely right when he puts this in the context of family and family breakdown. I do not know whether there has been any research done about this. Paedophilia has probably been going on for a long time. Certainly, family breakdown in society has contributed to the extent of paedophilia. It is interesting to talk about abuse within the family. There is a headline in my local paper today `Fathers top list for child abuse'. `The most common child molesters are fathers and stepfathers', it says. I would contend&mdash;but I do not have the statistics to back it here&mdash;that most of that abuse is being inflicted by stepfathers or by a parent in a de facto relationship. That is my contention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me base that on this fact: as far as I can see the abuse of a child by a natural father is at the absolute horrific end of the scale. We are not downplaying other parts of this scale of abuse, which are equally concerning. My guess would be that abuse of a daughter by a natural father would not be a frequent occurrence. Therefore, when we start to see headlines like `Fathers top list for child abuse', I believe the real emphasis is probably going to be on stepfathers and parents in de facto relationships.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the problems that the member for Moore touched on is that this sort of debate provides fertile ground for the anti&hyphen;family element in our society to get in and say that children are all abused in family relationships and, therefore, families are bad and the sooner the children are taken over by someone outside the family, where they will not get abused, the better. That is what really worries me about where this debate may ultimately go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I am sure of&mdash;and I have given a lot of thought to this over the years&mdash;is that we have in our society a very great problem with the breakdown of family. It leads to all sorts of other 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7355"> problems. Children are hurt by divorce in many ways. Whilst for a while there was trendy evidence coming out to tell us that children are better off if their parents get divorced, the latest evidence and the most persuasive evidence is that that is not the case, and that children suffer from divorced parents for a very long time in their lives. Now we are seeing very strong evidence that when divorces occur and we have these blended families, and blended families on blended families, the capacity for paedophilia&mdash;abuse of young children&mdash;is magnified because of that many times.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It gets back in my view, as the member for Moore made very clear, to a concern about the state of families in our nation. Whilst he was mildly critical of the performance of the government of which I am a member, I would defend the government. I think this government was elected with a very strong mandate to support families. I believe that we delivered on that commitment and we are further in the process of delivering on that commitment. I am coming very much from a concern as a pro&hyphen;family person in this parliament. Aspects of our policies have not moved quickly enough, but this issue may well galvanise us into further action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question which has been raised, and it was raised in the Queensland commissioner's report, is what the national response ought to be. The focus therefore comes back almost the full circle on the National Crime Authority and what role, if any, it ought to have in this. In fact, the Queensland commissioner says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Within the past decade a number of agencies established to focus on crime and its link to corruption of public officials in particular has addressed their role in combating paedophilia. In Queensland, this has involved the CJC and, at a national level, the NCA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In examining their jurisdictions for paedophilia, both agencies seem to have taken as a starting point, their mandate in relation to organised crime.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They then proceeded to address the question as to whether the available evidence regarding paedophilia suggests an organised activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of certain specific characteristics of organised activity these agencies have concluded that paedophile activity does not qualify as an organised activity in the terms of reference specified by them. From the standpoint of the relevant agency such an approach may be justified but, from the wider perspective of community interest and welfare, it does not seem very helpful and it constitutes something of an academic exercise. I tend to agree with the Children's Commissioner there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue of whether there is a role for the NCA in this has exercised my mind. The NCA has completed a strategic assessment of paedophile activity in Australia and the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) currently has that on his desk. My committee has asked to be briefed on the outcome of that assessment. We have asked for the assessment but there will be some very sensitive areas and we may not get the actual assessment. But, of course, we are looking forward to having a briefing on it. I think we can then look closely at whether there are some definitional problems in terms of whether it is organised criminal activity for the purposes of whether the NCA ought to be involved, and we may well proceed to address those particular issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The NCA has proved its effectiveness because it can cross jurisdictional boundaries, and so on, in combating a lot of aspects of organised crime. I believe it would be counterproductive to get bogged down in the question of whether paedophile activity is organised crime. The NCA committee, under my chairmanship, will continue to address the issue. The report that the committee did in 1995, driven largely, as I said earlier, by the member for Moore, does 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7356"> I think totally vindicate the concerns he had and his committee had then. Here it is, as I say, two years down the track and suddenly we have on our hands a recognition that we have here a very serious national problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of all of those considerations, the NCA committee will continue to focus on the issue. We look forward to seeing the outcome of the strategic assessment. I understand that it largely confirms the findings of this report and indeed confirms Justice Wood's findings which indicated that paedophilia, whilst it was a great concern, was not a nationally organised activity: it was occurring on a local level, within the context of family relations, and it existed in fairly close networks. But, in my view, that should not be, as the Children's Commissioner in Queensland says, the ultimate determiner of whether we address it on a national issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government responded a little further in the parliament yesterday in response to a question about the Wood commission. I would like, if I had time, to deal a little further with the suggestion that there be a national council for the prevention of child abuse. Time will beat me on that but I am pleased that this has been listed for discussion here in the Main Committee today. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a great pleasure to speak in the Main Committee this afternoon on this particular report of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. I think most members of this House would know that I have always been a great supporter of the role that parliamentary committees can play in advancing ideas to government. In this particular case, I think this is not only a timely report but also one which this government needs to respond to quickly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, I put on public record that the Australian Labor Party will give swift passage through both the House of Representatives and the Senate to any of the recommendations requiring legislation arising out of the committee's report. I have said that publicly. I have put that on the record in a number of different forums around this country in the last several months as we have talked to people in small business but I think it is the first opportunity that I have had to record it here in the parliament. I think it is important that that be said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think anybody who has participated in discussions with small businesses, particularly small businesses and franchisees in shopping centres, could be left untouched by some of the stories that these people tell about the complete and disproportionate amount of market power working against the interests of small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have travelled around in my capacity as the shadow minister for small business in the last two months&mdash;in the break&mdash;and spoken to people in shopping centres in Rockhampton, Wollongong, Melbourne, Newcastle and the Gold Coast. The stories I was told were mirror images of the stories which colleagues who sat on this committee heard in evidence which they received. They were the stories of small business people, micro businesses, and mums and dads operations: in Australia some 50 per cent of businesses are operations run by one or two people, often family members, that do not employ anybody else.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7357">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They told stories about the way in which market power was being used by shopping centre management and by owners of shopping centres to disadvantage them, and stories about being forced to relocate within shopping centres to areas where less passing traffic was going to mean a slashing of profitability for that small business and, in many cases, was going to cause it to go to the wall. They told stories about ways in which new tenancy agreements were struck and the way in which the small business person was disadvantaged in those negotiations with a virtual `take it or leave it, and if you do not like it then you are out the door' type of arrangement. When you talk to franchisees of the common franchises that we see in shopping centres about some of the master franchisors they tell stories about the way some of those franchisors&mdash;not all of them, but some of them&mdash;deal with people. They tell stories about the up&hyphen;front fees and the increases in outgoings which small businesses in shopping centres have to put up with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In one shopping centre I went to in Melbourne, the total cost of outgoings&mdash;the moneys that shopping centre tenants pay for things like joint advertising, cleaning, security and so on&mdash;was $600,000 in one year. The next year that was put up to $1.2 million. There was no consultation with the tenants. The centre management simply said, `Here's your new bill and you are going to have to learn to live with it. Of course, you will be levied an increased fee for the privilege of having your premises cleaned, guarded and advertised in joint publications.' These are the sorts of issues which are out there in the ether. These are the sorts of problems facing small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much has been said about small business in this country over the last 12 to 18 months and perhaps longer. There are two things I want to say. Firstly, we on our side of the parliament would be the first to concede that when in government we probably did not move as quickly as we should have to protect small businesses from unconscionable conduct, predatory pricing and some of the other issues which have been outlined in this particular committee report. I accept that, and we are moving to try to redress that&mdash;albeit, unfortunately, from opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, I think it is fair to say that in the election in March last year there was a clear expectation from small businesses that if they voted to put the coalition into government they would have friends in court and the coalition would move to support small business. Regrettably, they are telling me that that is not happening. They are telling me that some of the things the Treasurer (Mr Costello) or the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) are talking about at the moment, like capital gains tax, rollover provisions for retirement, unfair dismissal provisions and so on, whilst they are important to some small businesses, are not the key issues. What small businesses want is a return to profitability. What they want is business confidence. What they want is more people coming through the front door.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But they also want protection. They want protection from unconscionable trade practice. They want protection from some of the activities that certain shopping centre managers embrace as part of their running of shopping centres. In fact, what small businesses are saying is that they want to find a balance. They want to redress the imbalance that presently exists between the small shops and the people that own the shopping centres and manage the shopping centres. They want to make sure that that balance is redressed, with equality in terms of negotiating power at least.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report makes specific recommendations about that. As I have said, this report goes to issues like franchising and retail tenancy legislation. And, importantly, it says that in both of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7358"> those instances, we should have legislation through changes to the Trade Practices Act underpinning codes of conduct. We could not agree more. Giving small businesses the opportunity to take on landlords who are unscrupulous, in a fair, reasonable and equal arrangement, is critical to the improvement of small business and its operation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that it needs to be said, also, that access to justice and the cost of access to justice are disproportionate&mdash;and examples are given in this particular report. It is very easy for the Woolworths and the other major shopping centre operators in this country to throw a ton of money and a truckload of lawyers at a small business person and bankrupt that person, causing marriage breakdowns and all sorts of difficulties for those people, and not think anything of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the other hand, if there were access to justice through tenancy tribunals, an equalisation of that power relationship which presently is so unequal would occur. Quite obviously then small business would feel much better off and would, in fact, be much better off. They are the recommendations contained in this report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much has been said over the past several months about small business. In fact, it cost the former minister for small business, the member for Forrest (Mr Prosser), his position in this government, and we have a new minister now. This minister has said that he is going around talking to people. We all know that the government's response to this report was due last Tuesday. We have said to the minister that if he wants another couple of weeks because he is only new to the job, that is fine. He said that he wanted to talk to people to get an overview of what was going on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But while he is doing all that, of course, his bureaucracy is out there drafting the response that the government will bring down to this report. I know that there are members of the government parties&mdash;those members, particularly, who were part of the committee inquiry&mdash;that will be doing their utmost to ensure that their government upholds every recommendation to the last word to ensure that small businesses do get a fair go. As I said, on 2 March last year there was an overwhelming depth of support for this government by small business. They expected to get something. They expected to see opportunities for small business to be improved and, as a consequence of this report now being released&mdash;it being known to so many in the small business community&mdash;they can only hope that the government will be true to its word.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not unexpectedly, the other side of the equation&mdash;best described, I guess, as the landlords&mdash;is fighting back. The landlords have asked Access Economics to produce a contrary view to the parliamentary committee report. This contrary review was put out a couple of weeks ago and it was called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tipping the balance.</EMPHASIS> We all know in which direction that balance was proposed to be tipped when this analysis was done by Access Economics and came out on behalf of the Property Council of Australia. It was tipping it back towards the landlords.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite frankly, the criticism that this document levels at a parliamentary committee&mdash;almost claiming that a parliamentary committee of the House of Representatives was unprofessional in its approach to an issue&mdash;is laughable. I know that someone like you, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, who is as committed as I am to the way in which this parliament is seen as being so important to the nation's future and, to the fact that our committee system can make, and has made in the past, a tremendous contribution to changing government laws, would be just as offended as I am by some of the comments that are contained in here.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7359">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This creates an enormous problem for my good friend the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. On one hand, he has a parliamentary committee and his own colleagues saying unanimously that small business has got to be looked after. They are saying, `Look after the small business community that voted for us. They deserve an equal chance.'<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, you have got a report from the Property Council of Australia which says, `Don't worry about them; most of them are whingers anyway. Free competition is what it is all about. After all, Minister, the Property Council of Australia translates as landlords, and that translates as plenty of good donations around election time.' That is the balance that this minister is going to have to address.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much has been suggested about issues arising in this committee report. I am pleased to say that a number of media commentators have picked up on it and have reproduced some of the horrendous stories that were contained within it. But at the end of the day, it is simple for this government. They have a unanimous government report. They have the support of the opposition&mdash;and the Democrats, I might say&mdash;for enacting the legislative changes recommended in here and the other issues which are required and that will help small business. There is a win&hyphen;win situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is one of the truly great moments in Australian politics, where all sides of the political fence are quite prepared to say to the small business community, `We will help you. Here is the document that recommends how that will be done and here is the legislation going to pass through both houses of parliament with the support of every major political party.' I think that it is probably a bit of a rarity in this place to get everybody agreeing with each other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the committee, I know my good friend the member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins), who was a very active member in this and played a very real role, and also my colleague the former minister for small business and the member for Rankin (Mr Beddall), had a lot of time and effort which they were prepared to expend with government members in arriving at that joint position on fair trading.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If one quote illustrates the sorts of problems that small businesses have encountered as a result of this inequality in market power, it is the one that appears on page 4 of this report. I would like to have it read into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. It is from an unspecified retailer because quite clearly she did not want to be identified. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I once had a thriving business in an industry few could match my enthusiasm for . . . [What the retail leases tribunal could not consider is the devastating effect the past five traumatic years have had on me and my family which not even our once rock solid 27 year marriage could survive. We were once confident, positive thinking go&hyphen;getters but now we're broke and dispirited relics of our former selves with several stress related health problems, not the least being acute depression, insomnia, nervous tension and obesity. I went through premature menopause and my once cheerful, workaholic, loving partner is now an angry, aggressive alcoholic. Our children suffer too, helplessly watching both their parents fall to pieces before their eyes and their quality of life diminish. At 50 years of age, we've been left with a massive business debt, which we have insufficient earning power to repay, and . . . we now face the real prospect of being homeless as well.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The chains have been allowed to gobble us up and the landlord is allowed to trample us down. Our pleas to politicians fall on deaf ears and the legal system treats us with contempt. The end result is the tragedies exposed almost daily in the national news. Why must it be so? We too are entitled to our place in the sun. [The Fair Trading inquiry] has within its power to recommend that justice is done and if I believed in God anymore, I'd pray that you will ensure it is. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7360">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is from the heart of a retailer who has suffered grievously because of past policies of all governments. Here, with this report, is an opportunity to redress those sorts of problems. The Labor Party, for its part, will help in that process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have travelled extensively. I have spoken at retail rallies involving 500 people in Newcastle, 100 on the Gold Coast and 1,000 in Melbourne. They have told me what they want. Yet the minister for workplace relations came into this parliament yesterday and said what people want is capital gains tax rollover relief so they can pocket $500,000 on retirement. The only small businesses that could do that would be people that owned a McDonald's franchise or something similar, not the bulk of small businesses in this country.

I also welcome the contribution made by the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), who has just left the room. Whilst I recognise and acknowledge his helpful gesture in putting into place the recommendations that have now been handed down in this report, I am a bit at a loss as to why he and his government had not done just as much in their previous years of being in government. It is rather a bit too late. I must say that, whilst I welcome his gesture of helping, it does seem to be a little bit hypocritical to change his mind so quickly in such a short time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like the member who spoke before me, during my past 13 years of campaigning I too travelled very widely throughout my electorate. During that time I became extremely aware of the fact that small business was very, very adversely affected in a number of areas, particularly in matters concerning franchising, retail tenancy and justice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that some small businesses were getting the rough end of the stick. In my discussions with those business owners I could sense the frustrations that they were experiencing as a result of what I would often consider to be very unscrupulous business practices. They were forced to work under conditions which were, to say the least, very exploitative in several instances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that as a committee we heard many stories of anger, disillusionment and complete despondency from small business people due to the treatment they received from big business operators. I believe that small business should be given the opportunity not only to survive but also to prosper, and to be free from the types of predatory practices and standover tactics that they have experienced from these people in the past. I am very proud to have been involved in such a concerted attempt to provide a fair and equitable report. One of the members sitting opposite me was on the committee as well and I am sure he would agree with me that we spent many, many hours listening to some very horrendous stories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to point out that I am one of only three women on this committee. Whilst it is personally rewarding for me to acknowledge that an increasing number of women are entering into the small business area, it is also good to know that in the main they are the people who are making a success of their businesses. And perhaps, without wanting to get involved in the gender bias argument, there is something here that our male colleagues could learn from women in business.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7361">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issues that this report seeks to address are based on a real commitment to secure a better deal for small business, which after all is very important in the revival of our economy. When handing down this report, I&mdash;along with other committee members&mdash;was very much aware of the need to keep to the terms of reference set out by the then minister for small business, the member for Forrest (Mr Prosser). The brief included investigating and reporting on unfair business conduct and dealings, as well as on the social and economic implications of major business conduct issues and their subsequent outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would suggest that this report is very timely. For far too long governments have failed to listen to the concerns of small business. Indeed, action to ensure that acceptable and fair business conduct is practised in Australia is now critically important for the successful future of this country. The committee received an overwhelming number of written and personal submissions. It would be less than honest to say that in most of those cases, small business operators did not ask for special protection or special treatment; they simply asked for the opportunity to get a fair deal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The evidence provided to the fair trading inquiry suggested that small businesses are often very frustrated by what they believe to be unfair commercial conduct when entering into business dealings with larger and more powerful companies. Such behaviour was alluded to as being present in all states of Australia, and, in particular, it centred around tenancy agreements, as we have already heard. Claims were made that major retailers were in a position to insist that developers exclude certain other retailers, and claims were made that franchise agreements were one&hyphen;sided, more often than not in favour of the franchisor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my own electorate of Canning, many constituents have complained to me about such practices. One retailer situated in a shopping centre was advised several years ago that the centre would be increased in size and revamped. It was suggested that he should be relocated. Since that time absolutely nothing has happened in that centre except that since then this small business operator has been on a monthly tenancy lease. I defy anybody in this room, let alone outside this House, to run a business on such a basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In another case, a franchise operator was required to buy his stock through the franchisor. When the franchisee complained that part of the stock was inferior and damaged, he was told that he had no option to refuse it and it was suggested that he should sell his stock at a discount price&mdash;a ridiculous practice, I would suggest, for anybody to enter into. Another proprietor of a small business at a local shopping centre, neighbouring my electorate, advised the committee of action taken at the shopping centre against the property manager. She alleged gross overcharging in relation to variable outgoings and promotion levies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have mentioned these examples as just a few of those that were brought to the attention of the committee as we travelled around the country hearing submissions, that were subsequently printed in the report that was handed down. The issue of retail tenancy is a matter of much contention, with a  need for uniformity and security for tenants. I would suggest that this is a high priority. Predatory practices of big business are just not acceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee has recommended the need for contractual certainty to be paramount and for unfair and inequitable agreements to be done away with. It also recommended that a uniform tenancy code be developed to enable utilisation around the country and that this be underpinned in the Trade Practices Act. Establishing merchants' associations in shopping centres and regular statements of expenditure on outgoings and promotions was another recommendation which we believed to be highly desirable.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7362">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to franchising, many people see buying a small business as an attractive option for securing a job and as an investment for their future. Indeed, some people decide to buy a business once they receive a redundancy payment. The committee's recommendation that proper business education and research are required when one embarks on franchising&mdash;or, for that matter, buying a business&mdash;is in my opinion very desirable and should be given a lot of thought.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An argument was put before the committee that part IVA of section 51 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 should be amended to strengthen the stance on unfair conduct. The report outlines an amendment to the act that will incorporate a new provision dealing with unfair conduct in commercial transactions. Again, that is a recommendation that is very desirable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that all businesses deserve a fair go. Small business should not be excluded from this. I concur with the previous speaker, the member for Cunningham, when he said that there are many small businesses that have been subjected to some dreadful exploitation and standover tactics by larger and more powerful businesses. We do need a balance in business practices. We do need fair play for all dealers. We do not want to have business conduct in this country which is skewed to one side or the other of the market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all have to work harmoniously together and we should never really forget that it is the many thousands of small business operators that actually contribute to the wellbeing of this country. They are the people that provide the employment to our future generation. Unless we are able to find a balance in that situation, I am afraid that we will have some very nasty consequences to face. I therefore commend this report to the members here and to the government, and I do hope that we will find a fair balance in future trading for businesses.</PARA></SPEECH>

Developing the report and the inquiry was a very educative process for me and I am thankful to a number of members of the committee who played a great role in the inquiry and assisted me to understand the problems that confront small business. I also thank those that came before us for their assistance in that education.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the dismaying aspects of the whole inquiry process of this report was that so many of the people who came before us came very fearful of retribution. I have never been involved in an inquiry where so many people have asked for their submissions to be kept confidential and for their evidence to be given in camera. I think this reflects the type of atmosphere in which small business operates out in the real world, the way in which they feel concerned about the imbalance in power between small business and bigger business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I reflect on a person who operates a very successful small business in a shopping centre in my electorate. He came to me with a story that illustrated the problems that he had as a trader within that shopping centre and the problems that he had in operating a franchise. Incidentally he also has another arrangement, which is by way of licence, and there are problems with each of those arrangements. I said, `You have a story that would be of great benefit to the committee. It would be very helpful if you could put it to the committee as a submission and then come forward and discuss that submission.'</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7363"> mean down the track for him in his dealings with not only the shopping centre managers but also those who hold the franchises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sort of atmosphere that this inquiry was conducted in was in a way surprising. One of the principal people, a leading figure in one of the small business associations, in the last week of the last session said to me, `What was your expectation? What did you think was the situation out there? Was it as bad as you thought it might be?' I had to admit to her that it was much worse. We held public hearings in all of the mainland capitals and a number of public hearings were held here in Canberra. The thing about the stories that we were told was that they were consistent right around Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Wherever we went, people came forward who had tried to put in place small businesses but had failed not just because they were perhaps lacking in skills but because their aspirations were crushed by those who were more powerful. In saying that, I stress that we have to acknowledge that, in the way in which the market operates, there will be people who will go to the wall no matter how well intentioned they are. This report is not talking about those cases: it is talking about the people who, because of the imbalance of power, were not given a chance from the start.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the recommendations that we have made about a uniform national retail tenancy code. We have tried, as a committee, to set down in the report recommendations and suggestions that deal with matters that should be covered in a uniform tenancy code to ensure that we redress the imbalance that is there between the tenants and the shopping centre owners and managers. The code would be about simple things such as the need for full disclosure when a tenant goes into a situation about matters that might relate to that person's tenancy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the start of the inquiry, I thought the way things should operate was fairly straightforward and simple. I was shocked that, in practice, it did not occur, with great detriment and consequences to some of those people, who took up tenancies understanding certain details about the operation of the shopping centre, which they found had changed. They found that the basis for the number of people attending the shopping centre, and things like that, was overestimated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Professor Alan Millington, who operates out of one of the New South Wales universities, gave us evidence and, in his submission, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Above all, there is a need for retail property owners to accept that the success of their investments, and their shopping centres in particular, is ultimately completely dependent upon the success of tenants trading from them. Without successful retail tenants there would not be successful shopping centres. To have successful retail tenants owners must allow and assist them to prosper by working in partnership with them, rather than seeking to punish them for their success by . . . persistent demands for ever higher rents irrespective of the ability of retailers to pay such rents.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I thought that what Professor Millington said should have been self&hyphen;evident. It seemed fairly logical that the relationship between the property owners and their tenants should be to the benefit of both. But in practice there were just too many stories from tenants about the behaviour that they had had to endure and we would wonder why it occurred. In so many cases in evidence brought before the committee, we wondered why there was this behaviour that forced tenants out, forced tenants to fail and forced tenants to go to the wall?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we spoke to the property owners and managers, of course, they said that the relationship should be as the professor stated, because it is obvious that, in a relatively symbiotic relationship between the two parties, both can succeed. But there were just too many 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7364"> stories for the committee to ignore the fact that this was not the case. As the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) has said, it was of concern when the peak body of the property owners and managers came out with their own study and suggested that we were not balanced in the way we treated the evidence and that, in some way, the inquiry lacked professionalism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to those people that, if the complaints that were put to us were not real&mdash;and I believe that the overwhelming majority are real and have substance&mdash;even if the complaints were based on perception, those property owners and managers have a big problem. As has been illustrated in this discussion and debate, you can still go to a shopping centre and quite easily get together a number of tenants that will come forward with stories of hardship and complaint. For instance, earlier in the month, the shadow minister went to a meeting at a shopping centre in my electorate. I was absent and could not be there. Thirty tenants came forward to describe to the shadow minister, the honourable member for Cunningham, the experiences they were having. Those experiences surrounded things that are difficult for property managers to handle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This particular shopping centre has undergone a three-phase increase in the amount of space that is available. It has meant that tenants have been shuffled around the place as this work has been done. But it has been the way in which those matters have been handled that has caused angst. For instance, simple things such as the parking arrangements for the shopping centre have been changed unilaterally. Longer term parking had been changed to short&hyphen;term parking for people that were rushing in and out to the local supermarket. This affected neighbouring businesses because they relied on people coming into shopping centres, lingering and looking at the goods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are all these intricacies that have to be taken into account and they can only be taken into account where there is a partnership. As has been said often in the discussion of this report&mdash;and it is one thing that I think the committee wants to emphasise&mdash;small businesses are not looking for special protection. They do not want anything particularly special in the arrangements that are put in place for them. They just want a fair deal. They want to be able to operate in the knowledge that they are getting that fair deal. The type of suggestions that we have put forward about changes to the Trade Practices Act and about legislating that people can take action where they believe there has been unfair conduct are important aspects of the way in which small businesses can feel that, through the legislative process, they have some backing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been some criticism of the actions of the former Labor government in regard to the matters that have been discussed in this report. A number of us would acknowledge that, yes, they are matters that perhaps should have been redressed. But given the emphasis that there is at the moment on voluntary codes of conduct, I think that Labor in government was willing to say, `We will give them a go.' I have to say to you it has failed, and we are acknowledging that. The honourable member for Lowe (Mr Zammit) nods his head. He was somebody on the committee that emphasised that this was the case. He gave people the opportunity to say, `Show us where they have succeeded.'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He did a very good job and I acknowledge that. He, along with a number of other members of the government on the committee, as the honourable member for Rankin (Mr Beddall) said when he spoke on the day of the tabling, has been very courageous in putting forward recommendations that might have been difficult for some of those in leadership 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7365"> and in executive positions within this government. Some recommendations would go against the orthodoxy of thinking of government. I appreciate that it is often difficult when you are in government when you know that you are out of step with those that are down in the ministerial end of this building.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the committee came up with a unanimous set of recommendations that I would hope the government considers closely. The opposition has indicated that they are quite willing to support legislation based on the recommendations in the report. I am pleased that that has been the indication by the opposition. This report was a very careful discussion and investigation of matters surrounding the way in which small business is treated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The urgency of these matters is illustrated time and time again. At the moment, the people that have franchises with Shell have concerns because the arrangements that had been made about the pricing of fuel from Shell have been unilaterally changed. If the franchising code had been working properly, this would not have been allowed. But what we need to see is a legislative basis for franchising so that the codes of conduct can be enforced by legislation. We need some arrangements whereby the franchisors have to register so that the franchisees can comfortably feel that they do have some legitimate basis that will give them protection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope that, in the next few weeks, when the minister discloses the government's reaction to this report, they accept the recommendations that have been handed down by the report. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to rise to enter the debate in this Main Committee on the report of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Finding a balance: towards fair trading in Australia</EMPHASIS> . I must say that this is one of the most balanced reports I have ever had the pleasure of being part of. It comes from a committee of 15 people, all of whom are dedicated to trying to find a way to assist small businesses to have a fair go, which I think is one of the major Australian traits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been a member of parliament for some 18 months in the federal sphere, and for about 12 years before that in the state sphere. I have been involved by shopkeepers and tenants&mdash;reluctantly, on my part, but with no choice but to represent my constituents. If ever there was a tragedy of strongarm tactics being employed by those who have all the aces in the pack, this is one of the cases that I think should not have been allowed to go on for as long as they have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition has said that it gave voluntary codes of conduct a go. I appreciate that, but it has not worked. One of the questions we asked of all the people who came before us and who recommended the continuation of a voluntary code of conduct was: `Name one industry where the voluntary code of conduct has operated.' They could not, satisfactorily. No&hyphen;one could, because it just does not work. There is no doubt that you need to underpin it by legislation, and that is one of the recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where a retail tenant or a shopkeeper in a major shopping centre feels that, for whatever reason, they have been treated in an unfair and unconscionable way, there is nothing available to them, to fight back, other than to take legal action. But we all know that they cannot do that without going bankrupt. They just cannot take on the major shopping centres, with the tremendous facilities available to them&mdash;unlimited amounts of money, legal advice, and so on&mdash;and walk away without being hurt very badly or ending up being bankrupt, which is just as bad.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recall a particular instance in one of my shopping centres, where I came to know the owner of the shopping centre quite well and I found that person to be a very reasonable person. He 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7366"> is not an Australian national, and he had to leave the running of the company in the hands of a real estate agent who claimed to have management expertise in dealing with difficult situations. I struck up a relationship with this person. I had to bypass the managers of the shopping centre because I was getting nowhere with them. I was fortunate in that he was very willing to listen to me and very willing to come to some agreement. In some instances, that just could not happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I well recall getting a phone call from the centre manager in one of my shopping centres. In fact, I mentioned publicly in the inquiry that this person contacted me. She said, `Your request'&mdash;for whatever it was; I do not remember the exact matter&mdash;`has been denied.' I said, `I'm not very happy about that, because I think what you did was unjust.' She said, `But let me warn you. You could be up for very serious charges. You may or may not have seen the New South Wales act that specifically stops someone from entering as a third party into a dispute between two other parties in a shopping centre arrangement.' I must say that I found that intimidating. I found it insulting, in the implied threat that she was going to arrange to take legal action against me for representing my constituents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recall receiving a phone call from the company involved. They apologised for any such threat, but they claimed that the threat was not made. I said, `It's your word against mine, but I would suggest that you have it investigated.' They wrote back to me after about a week and they talked around the subject, but they did not deny that I had been threatened. I then phoned the general manager of the company and said, `I've got my own advice. If you try and stop me ever again from carrying out my duties as an elected member of parliament, then I will take my own appropriate action. That sort of action is not the sort of thing that would be useful to you or to me, or to the parliament, but you leave me no choice.' If these people can act towards me in the way that they have, you can imagine how much more intimidating it must be for the shopkeepers and the tenants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me give you specific examples of some of the things that have occurred. I know of a person who, in a shopping centre, owned a delicatessen&hyphen;type shop and was selling cheeses and ham and all the sorts of things that are sold in a delicatessen. The shopping centre allowed the extension of a supermarket and allowed it in such a way that, within three metres of the shop, there was a delicatessen&hyphen;type set&hyphen;up. I suppose you can say that competition is competition, but I say up to a point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there were any goodwill involved from the centre management, they would have said to the supermarket, `You can go ahead and sell all the things that are sold at a delicatessen but not so close to the entrance of this other shop.' But they refused to do that. When I asked them about that they said, `We have no right to intervene in how a supermarket runs its business.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then I pointed out to the supermarket that on an hourly basis they would put specials out to undercut that little shop that had been there for 15 years. As soon as the little shop put their specials out, within an hour the supermarket would put their specials out, undercutting them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer to the recommendations that the committee inquiring into fair trading brought down. I must say that it was very unique that we were totally united in our view on how to deal with this issue. The recommendations are to allow all little shops like the one I mentioned to do something about unfair and unconscionable conduct&mdash;which no doubt is what it is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the thing that holds these shops back is that they cannot go to court. First of all, they have reached a stage in their lives when they are having difficulty paying the rent and having difficulty meeting the competition. The last thing they can do is find another $40,000 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7367"> or $50,000 to go to court. Even if they went to court and won they would have to fight the shopping centre, which would say, `We think we've been unfairly treated by the court, and we'll appeal.' That means that the small shops would have to find another $40,000 or $50,000, and of course they just do not have that sort of money to fight back. This is a very complex situation that is facing Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to refer to a couple of specific recommendations that I believe are extremely important. One is recommendation 2.3, regarding dispute resolution. The committee has recommended low cost mediation. In other words, the committee has said, `Let's not run off to court all the time; let's put in place a mechanism whereby an aggrieved party can go to someone and say, "You're an independent arbitrator; would you arbitrate between us?"'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We request that, whichever side the arbitrator comes down against, the arbitrator do the right thing without anyone having to go to court. We want to stop Australia heading down the path of some other nations of the world where they go to court at the drop of a hat to resolve difficulties that they may encounter. I think that that is one of the most important things that the committee has recommended&mdash;to allow low cost dispute resolution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, the committee has said that it is very important that, in the event that the dispute resolution is not satisfactorily resolved, there be some mechanism by which an aggrieved party can go to a court without it costing them an arm and a leg&mdash;in other words, it does not do away with their right to defend themselves against something that is seen by them to be unfair and unconscionable conduct. That is not available to them at present. I think that that is one of the most important recommendations that we need to have a look at.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing that I want to raise is the question of uniform retail tenancy acts and a contract that is uniform throughout Australia. With all of these different jurisdictions&mdash;six states and two territories&mdash;having their different rules and regulations and contracts, it is very important that there be one contract Australia&hyphen;wide that everyone understands. People want to know how it can be used to resolve difficulties. They want the contract to be clear so that nothing is left out that may be used against a person who, unwittingly, may have signed a contract.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had solicitors appear before the committee who admitted to us that despite all of their training, the thing that concerned them was not what was in the contract, but what was not in the contract. That was the difficulty. They admitted to us that they were not able to advise their clients satisfactorily because it was not just what you read, it was what was not in it that could cause grave difficulty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to talk about the lack of relocation clauses that apply to retail tenants. One of the things that concerns a lot of retail tenants is the fear of relocation. A shopping centre manager can go to a shopkeeper who has been there for a very long time and say, `We are going to move you.' They might reply, `Well, if I have to, I have to.' The manager then says, `You don't have a choice; you have to because that is the decision.' Then the shopkeeper asks, `What does it involve?' and the manager says, `We're going to move you around the back, around the corner.' The shopkeeper then says, `But no-one will know where we will be,' and they say, `Well, that's too bad.' The shopkeeper finally asks, `What about the fit&hyphen;outs?' and the reply is, `That's too bad. You're going to have to pay for the fit&hyphen;outs as well.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That can be a tremendous drain on a retail tenant, and in many instances it virtually destroys them. It is not just the relocation of the shop from where they are known to another place 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7368"> where they are not known and which is perhaps difficult to find; they also have to find the money to do up the shop to the satisfaction of the centre management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I feel that this is a very important step that the committee has taken in outlining all of the difficulties involved in running a small business. I feel that the recommendations that are made here are very sensible and moderate, and they are going to help small and medium sized businesses tremendously. They are also going to help property owners because they will be able to have some stability in the way they run their businesses. There will not be the threat of legal action back and forth on both sides.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question :</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Services to be provided under the new employment services market are subject to competitive public tender. The levels of funding available to particular regions will not be known until the tendering process is completed and business levels allocated to successful tenderers. The following principles have been established to assist in allocating contract levels to providers:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) It is expected that successful tenderers will be formally notified of the outcomes of the employment services tender in January 1998.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) One of the aims of the employment services market is to provide client choice. Wherever possible, therefore, the Department will contract at least five providers in each region with the expecta 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tion of numbers in excess of this in metropolitan centres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) Advance payments will not be offered to employment services providers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government announced in the 1996&hyphen;97 Budget that approximately $180 million will be provided to the Public Employment Placement Enterprise (PEPE) Limited as a capital injection to establish the PEPE and enable it to tender as the public provider of employment placement services. In part, these funds will pay for the staff liabilities that the PEPE will inherit upon its establishment. These funds will also balance the PEPE's beginning Balance Sheet which is necessary for any commercial entity. These funds are not available to be used as operating subsidies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) The number of clients registered with the Blacktown Commonwealth Employment Service was 24,253 in 1995&hyphen;96 and 21,978 in 1996&hyphen;97. The number represents the sum of the number of clients registered at the start of each year and the numbers of new registrations during the year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) No. All contracted providers&mdash;public, private or community based&mdash;will be subject to the same contractual conditions with respect to client servicing and clients will be able to choose which provider they wish to be assisted by (where feasible).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) No. The Government is not establishing a dual system for employment services. It is establishing a more effective delivery of employment services which will be client driven. Clients will benefit from higher standards of service, more flexible and tailored assistance and ultimately better and more lasting employment outcomes.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In accordance with advice to me the answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Data on the number of redresses of grievance pending throughout the Australian Defence Force is not maintained. However, data is maintained on the number of redresses of grievance which have been referred to the Chiefs of the Navy, Army, Air Force, the Chief of the Defence Force, or their delegates, for resolution. On 1 August 1997 there were 132 redresses being investigated, or awaiting investigation on behalf of a Chief of Service or the Chief of the Defence Force.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) It would be misleading to place an average time on the completion of redresses of grievance. Each case is an individual case with its own particular set of circumstances.

To retrieve this data would require a physical search of all redress files and I am not prepared to commit further resources for this task.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) I am aware that the Nine Network, which has the exclusive free&hyphen;to&hyphen;air rights to the Ashes Tour, is not routinely providing live coverage of the first session of the test series in any State, and is providing a shorter coverage in Western Australia on some nights. Nine has announced that, in the event of a likely result during the first session of play, it will make every effort to arrange live coverage of that session.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) No. The Nine Network has offered the ABC and the SBS free&hyphen;to&hyphen;air rights to the first session of each test match in the Ashes series, but both broadcasters declined the offer. Due to the clash with the Wimbledon Tennis finals, Nine assigned to the ABC the rights to the Third Test. The ABC televised the second and third sessions of each day's play, except for the final day, on which it televised the first session because of the likely conclusion of the match during that session which, in fact, occurred. Nine has sold pay TV rights to Optus Vision, which is providing live coverage of the first sessions of the test matches and `delayed' coverage of the second and third sessions on its pay TV service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The Nine Network has advised that, in Perth, it is showing the third session of the test matches on Thursday, Sunday and Monday, and on Friday and Saturday, it is showing the second and third sessions of the matches.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4&mdash;6) The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has ongoing responsibility for monitoring business behaviour to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Trade Practices Act, including in relation to any anti&hyphen;competitive practices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The coverage of the current Ashes series in the UK points to deficiencies in the operation of the anti&hyphen;siphoning provisions in the Broadcasting Services Act 1992.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7381">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department's computer systems were updated to reflect the new Area structure and since that time information is only available according to the current Area structure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Due to the rationalisation of the Area office structure of the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs in August 1996, it is not possible to provide the information on expenditure in the specified Area and Regions for the time periods requested.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following an Area Office restructure in August 1996, Melbourne East Area ceased to exist. The Melbourne East regions which were situated north of the Yarra river (including Epping and Greensborough) were merged with the then Area Melbourne City West to create Area Melbourne North West and the remaining regions of Melbourne East were transferred to Area South East Victoria. The Department's computer systems were updated to reflect the new Area structure and since that time information is only available according to the current Area structure.</PARA>
<PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Area office restructure in August 1996 also involved a rationalisation of the regional office structure. This resulted in the then Greensborough region being absorbed into the Epping region. Therefore expenditure information is only available for the combined region and not for Epping and Greensborough separately.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Furthermore labour market program (LMP) expenditure data at the regional level does not include all LMP expenditure. Many LMP projects (in particular Special Employer Support, New Work Opportunities, JobSkills and LEAP programs) are administered at Area office level and are therefore not recorded at regional level on the computer system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The following table, therefore, contains information on LMP expenditure in all Areas in Victoria for each of the three six&hyphen;month periods from January 1996 to 30 June 1997. A list of regions covered by Area Melbourne East together with details of the programs involved are also included.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Communications and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Under s122 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (the Act), the Australian Broadcasting Authority (ABA) must, by notice in writing, determine standards for commercial television broadcasting licensees in relation to the Australian content of programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1995 the ABA determined a new Australian Content Standard for commercial television (the Australian Content Standard) effective from 1 January 1996. The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal's (ABT&mdash;predecessor to the ABA) Children's Television Standards (CTS)&mdash;(1990) and the Advertising Standard (Television Program Standard/TPS23)&mdash;(1992) remain in force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are two main mechanisms in the Australian Content Standard:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">&hyphen;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> an Australian transmission quota setting the annual overall minimum level of Australian programming between 6:00 am. and 12:00 midnight that includes first run and repeat programs (currently 50% of total programming between these hours); and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">&hyphen;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> first release quotas for minimum amounts of drama, children's programs (including 28 hours of first release Australian children's drama per year, rising to 32 hours in 1998) and 10 hours of first release Australian documentary programs of at least 30 minutes duration each year. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7383">  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further provision for children's programs is made in the CTS. This requires that commercial television licensees must broadcast at least 390 hours of children's programs per year. Fifty per cent of C (Children's) programs (classified by the ABA) must be first release Australian programs (at least 260 hours of C required each year). All P (Preschool) classified programs must be Australian (130 hours of P required each year).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the Australian Content in Advertising Standard, commercial television licensees must ensure that at least 80% of the total advertising time broadcast in a year by the licensee between 6:00 am. and midnight, is occupied by Australian produced advertisements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Under the Australian transmission quota, Australian programs must constitute at least 50% of all programming broadcast between 6.00 am. and midnight over a given year (ie. channels are not required to meet the quota on a daily basis). The quota will rise to 55% from the beginning of 1998.</PARA>
<PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Programs made with financial assistance from the television production fund do not qualify under the transmission quota.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The drama scores for all first release Australian drama programs broadcast between 5:00 pm. and midnight in any year must total at least 225 points and must total at least 775 in each succeeding period of 3 years. The drama score is calculated by multiplying a format factor for the program by its duration, using the formula `drama score = format factor x duration'. The values awarded to each format represent a bias towards encouraging short form, higher cost drama, rather than lower cost long form drama (eg. the format factor for an Australian telemovie of less than 90 minutes duration is 3.2 whereas the format factor for a serial or series produced a the rate of more than 1 hour per week is 1).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The ABA has provided the following breakdown of programming on the three Sydney commercial television stations between 6:00 pm. and 11:00 pm. on Tuesday, 24 June 1997.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) (a) Full Time&mdash;18,214.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) Short Term Temporary Employment&mdash;927.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The Government's Defence Reform Program will require a reduction in the number of civilians in the Department. To maximise the redeployment opportunities of displaced staff, recruitment is being constrained. However, because the number of staff who might be seeking redeployment is not known, it is not possible to set a clear estimate of civilian recruitment for 1997/98 at this stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) To ensure an appropriate skills base is maintained, the Department intends to recruit a significant number of trainees in 1997/98 via the Public Sector Recruitment Test conducted by Recruitment Services Australia. A specific trainee recruitment target has not been set at this time for the same reasons outlined in (2) above.</PARA>
