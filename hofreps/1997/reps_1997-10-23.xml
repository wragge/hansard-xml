<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The bill gives effect to a request by the states and territories to alter their shares of revenue replacement payments for tobacco under the safety net arrangements. These arrangements were introduced at the states' request to protect their finances following the High Court decision of 5 August 1997 affecting state business franchise fees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the safety net, the Commonwealth uses its taxation power to collect, on the states' behalf, revenue that they previously collected by way of business franchise fees on petroleum products, tobacco and alcoholic beverages. The revenues so collected are returned to the states&mdash;after the deduction of Commonwealth administrative costs&mdash;as revenue replacement payments under the States Grants (General Purposes) Act 1994. The distribution of revenue replacement payments among the states and territories is in accordance with shares agreed among them and set out in a schedule to the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The states and territories have asked the Commonwealth to adjust the shares for tobacco related payments at the earliest opportunity as part of new arrangements for the taxation of tobacco under the safety net involving a lower revenue target and a shift from a weight based surcharge to one based on both weight and value. Separate bills have 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> been introduced dealing with the revenue side of these new arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also seeks authority for any future changes in the distribution of tobacco, petroleum or alcohol revenues to be prescribed by regulation. This will provide flexibility should the review of the safety net arrangements, to be conducted within six months, give rise to further requests by the states to alter the existing shares. Any such change would be implemented only at the states' request.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Early passage of the bill will enable the Commonwealth to return tobacco collections to the states and territories on the basis of the new shares with minimum delay, assisting them to fund rebates for petroleum and alcohol&mdash;consistent with the objective of avoiding as far as possible price increases for these products.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I present the explanatory memorandum for the bill and commend the bill to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Capital gains tax roll&hyphen;over relief for small businesses</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill proposes amendments to the income tax law in relation to capital gains tax roll&hyphen;over relief for small business. These amendments were announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on 24 March 1997 as part of the government's response to the report of the Small Business Deregulation Task Force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Specifically, the bill will extend the capital gains tax small business roll&hyphen;over relief to the disposal of certain shares in companies and units in unit trusts. The roll&hyphen;over relief measures currently allow capital gains on the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9642"> disposal of active assets of a small business, where replacement active assets are acquired. These amendments will allow a capital gain on the sale of a business to be rolled over where this is done through the sale of shares or units. In addition, certain shares and units will be able to be nominated as replacement assets for the purposes of the provisions. Minor technical changes will also be made to the roll&hyphen;over relief provisions to ensure they operate as originally intended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The extension of the roll&hyphen;over relief to shares and units will apply to disposals of assets from 1 July 1997, which is also the date of effect for division 17A. The technical amendments have various application dates.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Amendment of the Sales Tax Assessment Act 1992</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments made to the Sales Tax Assessment Act 1992 by schedule 2 of the bill will establish a new sales tax regime for suppliers of computers and related goods to combat sales tax fraud involving personal computers and related goods. The amendments have been developed following a successful period of consultation with the industry, sales tax practitioners and other interested parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government and the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) have received numerous representations from business about the adverse effects that sales tax evasion is having in the industry. The impact is especially disadvantaging smaller legitimate operators who are often much less able to absorb the competitive disadvantage. A particularly worrying consequence of the fraud is that a large number of legitimate operators who claim their business survival is at risk are reluctantly being drawn into dealing with the fraudulent operators. In doing so they not only contribute to sustaining the fraud but also put themselves at serious risk of being a party to an offence. It is also apparent that a number of industry operators, while not directly involved in the commission of the fraud, are taking commercial advantage of the cheap source of supply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is estimated that such fraudulent activity is costing the government approximately $80 million per year. Whilst that threat to the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> revenue is of concern to the government, the major concern is that fraudulent operators should not continue to enjoy a competitive advantage from failure to comply with the sales tax laws. The amendments contained in this bill will remove this competitive advantage and place all operators in an even position. Operators who can only compete on a fraudulent basis may be driven out of the industry. This is a result which the government would welcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given the entrenched nature of this fraudulent activity and that normal administrative action is not effective, it is considered that the most effective approach is to remove the opportunity for the fraud to be committed rather than rely on after the event enforcement action. The central feature of the new scheme is that access to tax&hyphen;free personal computers and related goods (defined as part 7A&mdash;goods) will be denied to taxpayers who have not established, to the Commissioner's satisfaction, that they are likely to fulfil their obligations under the tax law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People who have established, by satisfying certain criteria, that they are likely to fulfil their taxation obligations will be accredited. Generally, only accredited people will be able to quote effectively, a procedure which allows them to purchase personal computer and related goods tax&hyphen;free. The quote will also have to be authorised, a process designed to guard against the fraudulent use of accreditation numbers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If a person is accredited, that person will be able to carry on trading in much the same way as he or she has done in the past, and the person's sales tax obligations will remain the same, except for the extra requirement that the quote must be authorised and there will be some extra record&hyphen;keeping and payment requirements. It is intended that authorisation will be available over the phone, so that it will not hinder trade unduly. Existing entitlements to end user exemptions will not be disturbed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, accredited people will take on extra obligations when they buy goods from unaccredited people. As a safeguard against attempts to frustrate these measures, there will be a requirement on accredited purchasers 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9643"> who purchase tax&hyphen;paid from unaccredited persons to withhold an amount, equivalent to the tax owing on the sale, from the purchase price and remit that amount to the commissioner. Certain entities, such as public benevolent institutions, will be exempted from the requirement for accreditation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If necessary, the withholding requirement will be extended to retailers who purchase goods from unaccredited wholesalers. This extension of the withholding arrangements to retailers will only come into effect if a review of the operation of the new regime indicates that such an extension is necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not the first occasion on which serious sales tax fraud has occurred. In the past similar problems have arisen in relation to other goods including motor vehicles, video cassette recorders, amusement machines, and stereo equipment. The amendments have been developed to provide a general strengthening of the law to counter evasion. The scheme is designed to be flexible enough to apply to other goods if serious evasion is uncovered in other industries.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Land transport facilities</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another measure in the bill contains the legislative rules for the new infrastructure borrowings tax rebate that was foreshadowed in the last budget. Resident lenders to new public road and rail infrastructure projects which are approved by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development against specified criteria may qualify for a tax rebate on their interest income at the general company rate of tax. To the extent that the lender's interest is rebateable, the project borrower will be denied a deduction in respect of interest payable on the borrowing. The rebate applies only for the first five years of an eligible project's borrowings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a transitional measure, the rebate scheme is also open to infrastructure projects which were eligible under the infrastructure borrowings tax concession which terminated on 14 February 1997. Projects which had applied to the Development Allowance Authority by 14 February 1997, and extensions of projects which had received certification, may qualify under the transitional rule. In addition, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> projects certified after the cessation of the previous concession may apply for approval.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Removal of exemption of the Commonwealth Rebate for apprenticeships full&hyphen;time training (CRAFT) scheme payment</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill removes the tax exemption of amounts payable to employers under the Commonwealth rebate for apprenticeships full&hyphen;time training (CRAFT) scheme in respect of apprentices who commence their training on or after 1 January 1998. The tax exemption is being replaced with a budget outlay to support employers of new Australian qualification framework level 3 and level 4 apprentices.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Minor technical and drafting corrections</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, Mr Speaker, schedules 5 to 11 contain a range of minor technical and drafting corrections and presentational improvements arising from the rewrite of the income tax laws under the tax law improvement project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I present the explanatory memorandum and I commend the bill to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate the opportunity to conclude my comments from the previous day. I would like to highlight my major objections to the government's plans in the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R276">Child Care Payments Bill 1997</XREF>  as they will affect the child&hyphen;care system as we know it in Australia. I strongly condemn the government for its cuts of $820 million to child care over the past two budgets. These cuts have led to fee increases of up to $20 and more per child per week, lower quality child care, the closure of services and job losses within the child-care sector, changes which are forcing people to stop working.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said in my previous comments in this debate, it is absolute fact, from talking to constituents in my electorate and in my community generally, that families are now being forced into the position where they have to make a choice: which one of a two&hyphen;parent family can maintain employment, given the overriding increases in child-care costs? It is no longer an economic reality for them to be able to maintain that employment. It is forcing mainly women out of the work force&mdash;something that I deplore and find hard to take, given this government's stance that it has a proud record on women's affairs. People are being forced to take their children out of child care. As I have said previously, we now have a situation where some people ill&hyphen;advisedly are relying on non-accredited or non-professional child care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I also feel very strongly about the decision by the government to cap child-care assistance to 50 hours and to limit emergency child-care assistance to four weeks in any 12-month period. Emergency child-care assistance is paid to the operator of a child-care service when they believe that a child is at risk. A child is considered to be at risk if at risk of physical, emotional or psychological abuse. The operator of a child-care service can apply for that emergency child-care assistance. The payment is for up to four weeks and can be paid only once during a 12-month period.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9647">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I do not understand why children in emergency care should not be able to get far more than four weeks emergency child-care assistance in any one year. I do not see why children in emergency situations have to suffer because of this government being hell-bent on cutting money from child care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The 50&hyphen;hour limit for each week of work related care imposed through the guidelines is now enshrined in legislation. I deplore that decision as well. There are some parts of this country&mdash;maybe not in my electorate in the ACT, where people are fairly geographically close to most work employment bases&mdash;where working parents have to commute quite a distance between home, the area in which a child could be in child care and their employment base.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Central Coast, Liverpool or Campbelltown in New South Wales, Adelaide Hills in South Australia, or the Mornington Peninsula in Melbourne&mdash;these are areas where it is not a long bow to draw to conclude that families need to have quite a bit of commuting time outside of their employment hours. To limit child&hyphen;care assistance to 50 hours a week really puts a constraint on families who need additional time to commute between the child&hyphen;care centre, the employment base and home. It is another example of the mean-mindedness of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's  Child Care Payments Bill 1997  has added more pressures to child-care services on top of last year's budget cuts, which are already hitting families with fee increases of $20 and more. The changes are forcing people to stop work, others to take their children out of child care, and some families are being forced to rely&mdash;ill&hyphen;advisedly, as I see it&mdash;on backyard or non-professional care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The National Association of Community Based Children's Services, as I have already said and want to highlight again, has said that 67 per cent of families have left centres and have been using informal care since the changes of the last budget relating to community based services came into effect. There is absolutely no reason for us to believe other than that a similar example will occur when these additional changes come in.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The federal government cuts are sending the child-care industry in this country back to the dark ages of unaccredited, low quality care. This is a direct result of this federal government cutting $820 million from the child-care sector over the past two budgets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I feel very strongly for the women in the community and in my electorate in respect of the dramatic improvements over the past few years to child-care provision in this country. What we had was a highly regarded professional system of optional care. We now have the situation where child-care places are being limited; child-care fees are being forced up; flexibility is being removed; out of school hours care is now under threat; and children in emergency situations are now going to have limits in terms of what sort of additional care they can get.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I know what this government has in mind, and the women and the families in my electorate are starting to tell me what they see it has in mind. It wants to bring employment rates down, force people generally but particularly women out of the work force, and reduce access to child care in this country in a most deplorable fashion. Women, families and children in our community deserve nothing less than access to flexible, optional child care to suit their needs&mdash;whatever they may be and for whatever reason they exist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is engineering changes to such a degree that optional, flexible access to child care is now totally and absolutely under threat. I deplore the government's bill. I strongly support the amendment. I encourage all of those members opposite&mdash;particularly the female members&mdash;to get behind us and to consider very carefully what they are supporting when they support the government's initiatives in these bills.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I would like to congratulate the former Minister for Family Services for her comprehensive restructure of the child&hyphen;care industry. Although there are some who would disagree with my compliments, as per the last speaker, the honourable member for Namadgi (Ms Ellis), I believe that the former minister has done a great job to curtail excessive waste and duplication in the industry and, at the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9648"> same time, provide the means for a full range of appropriate child&hyphen;care services which can be allocated, including exemptions for certain low income families who require the provision of additional care.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of the funding changes to community based long day care centres implemented in the May budget, I have received a number of submissions from concerned parents and centre operators who claim that these centres have to increase their prices to make up for the loss of government subsidy. As a result of these claims, I held a meeting with the community based long day care centre directors in my electorate to discuss the changes and how they would impact on the centres. During these discussions, every one of the representatives from the community based centres told me that they would have to increase prices by a minimum of $20 a week and, in some instances, more. But all of these community based centres were already charging per week at least the same as or more than the private child&hyphen;care centres in my electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the increases, the community based centres are pricing themselves out of the market with fees of up to $200 per week in some instances, which is $20 or $30 more than private centres are charging. I have visited both private and community based centres in my electorate and I cannot find any material differences in their operations that would require one sector to charge 10 per cent to 15 per cent more for the same service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I spoke to some private child&hyphen;care centre operators, they told me that they fully meet all accreditation standards at their facilities, provide the same level of service as community based centres and still make a profit. These private centres have the latest toys, the best equipment, clean and tidy premises and efficient, qualified staff, yet the community based centres are struggling to make ends meet with increased prices. The question must be asked: why?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the reasons for the differences, as I see it, is that the community based centres are not running their centres as a business but more as a bureaucracy where every job has a demarcation line and no&hyphen;one steps over it. If 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a light bulb needs changing, they will call in an electrician. If the grass needs cutting, they will bring in a professional cutting service&mdash;all at cost.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="FERGUSON" NAMEID="8T4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8T4">Mr Laurie Ferguson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You could do it for them.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LK6">Mr MAREK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Most certainly. I would not have a problem with that. The private centre operators do these things themselves to keep the costs down. I have tried to convince some community based centre directors to do the same thing. All I received was a lot of abuse and was told, `You don't know what you're talking about.' That is interesting. They are wrong. We have had a very close look at it and, for what it is worth, demarcation is the problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The private centre operators need to get stuck into this so that they can bring the child&hyphen;care centre prices down. `You cannot expect every child&hyphen;care worker to do that,' was their reply. Well, I do expect them to muck in when necessary or even to have a parent roster where some of these duties can be conducted without cost. After all, they are meant to be community based child&hyphen;care centres, which means that the community using the facility should provide some voluntary help similar to the school P&amp;Cs. That way the additional costs can be kept to a minimum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Basically, the operations that were introduced by Labor were nothing more than that good old socialist welfare mentality where the government pays for the lot and nobody mucks in to help. That is where the problems have come from. But some of these community based child&hyphen;care centres believe it is their right to fully charge the taxpayer for all and sundry. As I said, it is typical socialist welfare mentality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some private centre operators have contacted my office, concerned about the money being provided by the taxpayer to upgrade community based child&hyphen;care centres in my electorate. While I appreciate the former minister's initiative to fund these upgrades to bring them up to scratch before the subsidies cease, most private operators say that they have to fund any upgrades they make from their takings and then they ask why the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9649"> community based child&hyphen;care centres cannot do the same.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will come as no surprise to learn that a lot of these community based centres are in dire need of upgrading. Whether it be a coat of paint, protective railings or extensions of facilities, it shows that these centres have not spent any money on improvements and have continually waited for the government to provide the necessary funding. So when you look at it, they have been getting all the taxpayers' dollars, the same amount of money, or more, than the private ones and they are providing a service of a lesser standard. One must ask the question once again: why? If the private centres can meet the cost, the community based centres should be required to do the same, which I am sure will be the case once this funding round has been completed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the newest community based child&hyphen;care centres in my electorate, built 12 months ago from Commonwealth funding, made an operating loss of $160,000 last year. With a cut in subsidy funding this year of around $50,000, the centre is facing a $200,000 shortfall. The local council is seriously considering its options because it cannot afford to subsidise this amount of money. It is absolutely ludicrous. This could find the centre closing its doors or raising its fees to a prohibitive amount just to survive. Again, the question has to be asked: why?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the centre was originally planned it was anticipated that more families would use the centre than had been the case. But, before this centre was built, a private centre was opened and this took some of the potential custom. However, rather than cut back on staff and services according to the need, they continued to provide a service over and above what was required. This is not good business sense and, if it was not for the private centre, the owner would have folded or rather would not have continued to have provided a service beyond the centre's means, which is plain business commonsense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would appear that when you are spending taxpayers' money it does not matter; there is plenty more where that comes from. But that is not the case anymore. Community based 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> centres will have to run their operations like a business and be responsible to their shareholders, the families that use the centre. If they do not, then they will not be able to compete and they will either lose money or close, or they will have to put their prices up so high that they will lose custom as a result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following the cuts to the operational subsidy, three community based centres in my electorate jointly took out half&hyphen;page advertisements in the local newspaper saying `Free child care for one week'. The headline is crazy. Taxpayers paid for the local advertising as well. The offer of free child care for one week was essentially to attract new customers to the community based child-care centres. However, this is illegal under the act. Section 8.3.2 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Same fee for same service. All users must be charged the same level of fee for the same type of care.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In section 8.3.4, `Discounted fees', it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Services may offer discounted fees as long as all families using the service are offered the same discount rate, all families have the opportunity to pay the same fee for the same type of service and discounted fees are advertised to all families.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Yet strangely enough the directors of these community based long day care centres took no notice of these rules and regulations and went ahead with the advert. After my office fielded a number of complaints from private centre operators, who were the only ones who would lose their customers, I took the matter up with the council which is responsible for these centres. Even though the council agreed the advert was illegal, in accordance with the act, the council could not convince the directors of these centres, who argued they were doing nothing wrong and did not want to withdraw the advert. Fortunately commonsense prevailed and all the advertising was withdrawn by the council, as well as the discount offer. But this situation and other issues that I have raised here make me wonder what type of people we have running these centres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I compliment the Minister for Family Services (Mr Warwick Smith) for allowing disadvantaged areas access to funding, as these centres are often the only ones in the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9650"> community and they would find it difficult to raise the fees in these disadvantaged areas. I am talking about areas like Middlemount, Moranbah, Clermont and all those sorts of places in Central Queensland where they do need the benefit of the Commonwealth funding and fall into the criteria. If they do fall into the criteria, then they should get it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also compliment the minister for providing exemption for families of disabled children from the 20&hyphen;hour week for non-work related subsidised child care. This section of the community do find it hard to manage when they have other children to care for, so it is a change that will certainly assist these people to continue to access the level of service they require.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now turn to another issue which, as far as I am concerned, affects all young people throughout this country. A survey on juvenile delinquency taken by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Morning Bulletin</EMPHASIS>, a reputable regional newspaper in Central Queensland, indicated that a considerable number of people want harsher penalties for juvenile crime. The message was that governments need to get tougher&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say that the electorate at large of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Marek), must be overwhelmed by the type of nonsense we have just heard him comment in this House today. I feel sure that child&hyphen;care workers and parents in that electorate will be only too pleased to receive a copy of that speech in the mail!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In speaking in the cognate debate on child care today, I would like to bring to the attention of the House that in electorates like mine across Australia, particularly those areas that are heavily populated by families of lower 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and middle incomes, the public child&hyphen;care system is today, under this government, quite simply in crisis&mdash;a crisis from which there appears to be no respite and no end. It is a crisis for which the blame can be laid fairly and squarely at the feet of the Howard government and the woefully inadequate and ill&hyphen;equipped previous Minister for Family Services, the honourable member for Pearce (Mrs Moylan). It is a crisis brought about by this government, which has no understanding of how its ideologically driven plans for the child&hyphen;care sector are actually being felt in practice by thousands of struggling Australian families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation we are debating here today is just another indication that this government remains oblivious to the damage it is causing among thousands of those struggling families. This is a government and a Prime Minister which supposedly stand for choice in child care. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said just before the last election:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are going to provide people with greater choice about the caring arrangements for their young children . . . it's the role of the Government to facilitate choice. Now, that's the policy, that's the philosophy, the attitude, the approach.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Yet for hundreds of families, for hundreds of parents in my electorate and throughout western Sydney, there is increasingly but one choice thanks to this government: pull your kids out of child care. The Prime Minister said in 1995:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have long accepted in the Coalition that the provision of adequate, affordable, available child&hyphen;care facilities ought to be part and parcel of the armoury of facilities and policies that are available for both men and women in Australian society in the 1990s.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Does the honourable member for Capricornia remember that quote? Yet in areas like mine the Prime Minister, now in power, is slowly dragging adequate, affordable and available child care out of the reach of lower and middle income families. I am not being alarmist. I am not overdramatising the situation. This is the predicament on the ground in my electorate and others like mine. I know that the same pain is being felt right across the entire country.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9651">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all know because it is an established fact that, as a result of the Howard government's cuts to the community based child&hyphen;care sector of over $820 million, virtually all centres were forced to increase their fees and reduce the amount of services they offered in order to survive. The consumer price index figures released in June of this year showed child&hyphen;care and education costs had gone up nationally by 6.3 per cent in the previous 12 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The National Association of Community Based Children's Services has stated that community child&hyphen;care centres increased their fees by an average of $18 per week after their operational subsidies were taken away. A survey conducted by the Australian Services Union in May and June of this year found that over 70 per cent of the 21 councils it contacted in Melbourne, for example, had increased their fees or planned to do so by 1 July this year. Fee increases were planned to be in the range of $7 to $30 per child per week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the same story all over Australia. In my electorate, and in those centres just outside my boundaries which are populated by many children who live within my electorate, weekly fees rocketed by over $40 per week per child in some cases. It has reached the ridiculous situation where parents sending their children to exclusive private schools are paying less money per year than those parents sending a child to community based care. Parents are now spending over $8,500 a year to have their child receive community based care in my electorate. But you send a child to an exclusive primary school such as Loreto at Kirribilli, just up the road from the Prime Minister's house, and you are looking at around $3,500 per year in fees. I think, and those in the House would agree with me, that this situation is just slightly ridiculous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of such increases many lower and middle income families have found child&hyphen;care fees completely beyond their reach and have been forced into withdrawing their children from care. A survey of over 1,000 community care centres by the National Association of Community Based Children's Services shows quite clearly that more than 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 4,000 families across Australia have withdrawn children from long day care or have dramatically reduced their hours in care over the last three months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As was predicted 18 months ago by us, parents who have withdrawn their children from care or who have greatly reduced the amount of time in care are leaving them in backyard childminding operations. Sixty&hyphen;seven per cent of parents now leaving the community based child&hyphen;care sector are making or have made arrangements to place their child in informal care&mdash;unregulated and unaccredited care. These operations are little more than rudimentary childminding services. There is no actual child care to speak of. In these operations the ratio of children to child supervisor is often completely unacceptable. The supervisors themselves often have no experience or background in caring for children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my community there is anecdotal evidence to suggest that parents are taking, or have taken, their children from community based centres and are leaving them with out&hyphen;of&hyphen;work young people&mdash;many of whom have only recently left school themselves and who are on unemployment benefits&mdash;and paying them around $80 per week to keep their child under supervision. These young people are often virtually children themselves, having just left the education system. They have not received certification or accreditation for their child-care skills. They have no concept of the importance of professional child care in the development of an infant. Parents in desperation have been forced into these arrangements and the only losers will be the kids.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The devastating effects of poor quality child care have been well documented. Whether it be through abuse or neglect, untrained staff controlling children with punishment rather than effective programs, inadequate nutrition, dangerous play areas, high stress levels among staff or a high staff turnover, poor quality child care can do permanent and substantial damage to a child. Damage can include poor emotional, social and language development in the child, aggression, depression, inferior health and an inability to form close and long lasting attachments.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9652">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One need only consider the exhaustive 27&hyphen;year study carried out by the American sociologist Dr David Weikart which found that children who had attended safe and caring preschools developed into adults who committed less crime, earned more money and were able to commit to relationships more easily. He also found that every dollar spent on high quality child care saved approximately $7 in juvenile delinquency costs. Dr Weikart said, and this should be of interest to the Minister for Family Services today:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Do we pay for long&hyphen;term social costs that result from poor-quality child care, or pay now for a children's&hyphen;services program that will ensure quality outcomes with reduced social problems in the future.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This government, in creating an environment where parents are being forced into choosing inferior care for their children, and in putting forward bills such as the one before the House today, is quite literally gambling with the health and welfare of the next generation of Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And it is not just the safety and health of those children under five for whom we should be concerned. The previous budget and this bill launches an all&hyphen;out assault on outside of school hours child care, which caters for children aged between five and 12 years. As with community based care centres, operational subsidies for outside of school hours child&hyphen;care operations are to be abolished. The flow&hyphen;on from this is that many of those parents unable to pay the extra fees demanded of them will have to either leave work early in order to care for their child personally or allow them to look after themselves&mdash;alone in the house and perhaps caring for another brother or sister&mdash;until either mum or dad can make it home. We are now retuning to the latchkey kid syndrome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A survey conducted in May last year found that 22 per cent of Australian children under the age of 12 with working parents were already being left at home alone both before and after school. Following the Howard government's cuts to outside of school hours care, that number is bound to increase. In areas like mine where parents do not have the disposable income to accommodate a $30 to $40 per child per week increase for outside of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> school hours care, we are going to see an explosion in the number of latchkey kids when these cuts come into effect. And if children are not being left in backyard childminding operations, if they are not being left alone at home to fend for themselves, it is their parents&mdash;invariably the mothers&mdash;who are now reducing their hours of work or dropping out of work completely in order to care for their children themselves. So much for the Prime Minister's choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am meeting women regularly in my electorate who have either substantially reduced their working hours or have dropped out of work completely because of the prohibitive cost of child care. Perhaps the results of such a drop&hyphen;off of women from the workplace are already being seen. The number of women in full&hyphen;time employment fell by 23,000 in June of this year whilst the number of women in part&hyphen;time work went up by 20,000. Of course, I do not suggest that the spiralling child&hyphen;care costs are the sole cause of such figures, but at the same time we cannot discount them as a contributing factor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But don't expect this Prime Minister to raise a finger to stop women leaving their jobs under duress and staying at home to care for their kids. Since coming to power, the Prime Minister's stance on a number of policy issues has exposed him as being completely out of touch with Australian women and their needs in the 1990s. More than out of touch, the Prime Minister's agenda has been consistently anti&hyphen;women. We have a Prime Minister whose vision of the perfect woman is trapped somewhere between a TV margarine advertisement and Her Majesty. Judging by the way his child&hyphen;care policies are shoehorning women out of their jobs and back into their homes, a woman's primary role, in the Prime Minister's eyes, should be that of a housewife&mdash;I won't go so far as to say barefoot and pregnant, but certainly in a pair of sensible shoes and in a nice floral number, with a stiff drink or a cold beer in her hand when hubby comes home after a hard day at the office. The Prime Minister sees the child&hyphen;care industry developed by Labor as catering for minority special interests. When did looking after women's concerns become catering for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9653"> minority special interests? He sees child care as pandering to the demands of the feminist elite rather than simply assisting women achieve workplace equality and social manoeuvrability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And don't think I am being partisan in my criticism. What did Avril Henry have to say? Ms Henry, in case members are not aware, was nominated in both 1995 and 1996 for the Telstra Businesswoman of the Year Award. She is currently the Director of Human Resources, Asia&hyphen;Pacific Region, for the DMR Consulting Group and one of Australia's leading women business figures. Ms Henry said about the government's changes to child care, of which this bill is part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think the new government is just seeking ways to incent women to stay at home.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And throughout it all one thing stands brilliantly clear. For all the women on the other side of the House who have crowed about their numbers since coming to power, they have proven themselves powerless to stop their Prime Minister in regards to child care; and that just goes to prove my point. He doesn't listen to women or their concerns&mdash;whether they be a minister of the Crown, a backbencher or an average suburban mum. The Prime Minister doesn't know what women need from their government and what issues concern them. I know this must be extremely galling for members like the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), the member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) or even the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Family Services, the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth), who is at the table, who I believe deep down perhaps have a greater understanding of what is at stake here. But, no matter how much they try to reach him to convince him, the Prime Minister remains oblivious to their concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As children are being wrenched out of our community child&hyphen;care centres in their droves, whether they are being placed into backyard care operations or whether they are remaining at home with a parent, the result is that community based child&hyphen;care centres are in many cases now suffering enormous numbers of vacancies, and this carries with it very serious consequences. Enormous numbers of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> vacancies mean less money coming in to keep the service running, less money for staff wages and less money for special services such as nappies, hot food and bed linen. Less money in community based centres means closure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my electorate, vacancies at community based child&hyphen;care centres are now running at an all&hyphen;time high. Whereas before the fee increase a community based centre would have an average of close to 300 kids coming through its doors each week, some of them now are struggling to maintain over 100 regular child&hyphen;care attendees. Their waiting lists, it is hardly surprising, are now a thing of the past. And those kids who are coming in are staying for shorter periods. Whereas prior to fee increases children would attend child care for between three and five days, now most parents are bringing their kids along for only one or two days at the most. In fact, in my electorate there are enough vacancies, with parents withdrawing their children from community based centres, for the council to close at least two of its operations down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thankfully, due to the professionalism of the child&hyphen;care staff and the support of the parents, new arrangements have now been drawn up to try to keep the centres which are currently operating open. But this is being done at a cost. While centres will continue to function, the pay&hyphen;off is that permanent staff hours have been reduced and casual staff have been laid off. Those special services which I mentioned before, such as nappies, hot food and bed linen, have either been drastically curtailed or completely stopped.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must commend those in charge of coordinating the community based child&hyphen;care centres in my electorate. The deal they have brokered with the parents in order to stop the centres closing down is as balanced as was humanly possible under the circumstances. But I still hold grave fears for the future of community based child care in my community. I know that elsewhere in western Sydney community based centres have already closed down because of unfillable vacancies. If public child&hyphen;care centres in my electorate continue to shed children at current rates, it will only be a matter of time before closures become 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9654"> unavoidable. In the broader community, and particularly in the Prospect electorate, we will be the loser.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The strain of the government's attack on child care and families has already seen the demotion of the previous Minister for Family Services, the member for Pearce (Mrs Moylan). All I can say is that we now have her political scalp, which I don't cherish. But, considering the state of the public child&hyphen;care system in this country, we can ill afford another bumbling deadweight for a minister sitting on the front bench handling that portfolio when we need action now to remedy the mistakes that this government has made in the last 18 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the member for Hindmarsh, the member for Moncrieff, the member for Adelaide, the parliamentary secretary, or one of the other senior backbench women figures on the government benches could do a better job than the current Minister for Family Services (Mr Warwick Smith), and I believe they can, then for goodness sake the Prime Minister needs to be convinced to get somebody in that portfolio who is able to protect the children in this country and also return those millions of dollars worth of funding to the sector. They should stop taking what is now being dished out to them, and I stress that they should act now. With measures such as the ones presently before the House, the Howard government is plunging public child care further and further into crisis. Australia once had an internationally admired and unique child&hyphen;care system of which it could be proud. Now it appears we are on the way to a second rate system which divides child care between the haves and the have&hyphen;nots a la the USA or the United Kingdom system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to the bankrupt ideology of the Liberal and National parties, we should be aiming for more choice in child care, but only for people who can afford it. If you cannot afford to pay for extra choice, you quite simply have little or no choice at all. In relation to child care, little or no choice spells the end of community based care for many parents in my area. Government members should really try visiting some of the less privileged areas of Australia to find out just 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> how their ideology of `more choice'&mdash;their words&mdash;is affecting child care. They would then realise that for many of these people `more choice' is simply empty lip&hyphen;service which does not translate into equality or reality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only choice many of the parents in my electorate have is between leaving work to care for their kids, taking up a second job to pay for higher fees or leaving them with some shonky backyard operation down the road where heaven knows what happens to their kids during the day. Is this what we want? Is this what this government is pretending is the choice?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government inherited a public child&hyphen;care system second to none. The fact that it now stands on the brink of disaster is one of the greatest tragedies of this administration in its first 18 months in power. I, for one, do not thank them for it. When you talk to the communities, the parents, the people and the very efficient staff who are running these centres, they too do not thank this government. The promises that were given prior to the election are not even worth the paper on which they were written. The Prime Minister, when Leader of the Opposition, made all of these idle promises, and all we have now in government is the rhetoric for which they were worth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The kids are not going to suffer continually under this government because, come the next election, the parents, their children and the staff administering the centres are not going to be there to say, `Thank you, Prime Minister.' The parents and staff will record their disgust in the ballot box.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I condemn the government for the type of action it is taking and for the mean way by which it believes it can put cuts into budgets without even explaining to the people what it really means at the end of the day. The kids are the ones we should be looking after. As I have said in my speech, they are the future generation of this country and they are the ones that we should be protecting. I condemn the government for this.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I turn to her remarks, I want to comment on the remarks made by the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Marek), who saw this legislation as involving a matter of parental disciplining and the rights of parents over children. Indeed, the honourable member is a member of the backbench committee that promised so much change in the child support area but has delivered so little. I just say to the House that I am looking forward to debating with the honourable member on 9 November in Brisbane child support issues and the lack of progress by the government in implementing reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps it is uncharitable of me to draw to the attention of the House that no government has been returned with as many women members amongst its ranks as the Howard government. Without being mealy&hyphen;mouthed about it, I wish to congratulate them on that. I could offer qualifications but that would only detract from the sentiment that I wish to express. Perhaps it is unfair to all those new women members to point out how singularly ineffective they have been in this whole family services area&mdash;the absolute shemozzle that the nursing home accommodation bonds represent, the absolute bashing of the elderly, who so strongly supported the election of the Howard government. And here we are debating another similar issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Prospect repeatedly pointed out the promise of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), when in opposition, that he would be offering more choice. But really I think the people of Australia cannot get away from the idea that the government, particularly the Prime Minister, is obsessed with a stereotype family, that is, a family that lives in a house with a picket fence with the husband at work and the wife at home minding the children. The government has no conception whatsoever of the necessity in today's society for so many families to have both parents earning an income and contributing to the family.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my electorate, as, I am sure, is the case in the honourable member for Prospect's, I serve two local government areas, Blacktown and Penrith. It is said that the number of child&hyphen;care centres in those two local government areas are in fact the highest in Australia. Why is that so? Because we have a lot of young families moving in, setting up their homes or buying their first homes in these electorates. To pay mortgages in this day and age out in the western suburbs of Sydney overwhelmingly means that you need both parents working. Child care is absolutely critical to women being able to return to the workplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a whole revolution in the roles of women in society in the past 20 years, which I think we should be proud of. Really, there is nothing that they cannot aspire to by way of an occupation and a career. I, for one, rejoice in that; I think it is terrific. But being able to have the security of the knowledge that, whilst they are in the work force, their children are receiving proper attention and proper care is absolutely fundamental to that. It is true that in the community based child&hyphen;care centres the operational subsidy has been cut out. For those many child&hyphen;care centres in both the Blacktown and Penrith LGAs, the councils have made up the difference&mdash;and congratulations to them&mdash;but it has still meant that there have been fee increases. Of course, where they are not council&hyphen;run child&hyphen;care centres, the parents have picked up the full measure of the first tranche of the slashing of child care&mdash;that is, the $820 million that the Howard government has ripped out of child care and forced parents to pick up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is that issue. The second issue is that, even though Penrith and Blacktown are still increasing dramatically in size, so that there is a requirement for even more child care places, this government is reducing the number of new child&hyphen;care places&mdash;7,000 per year. One of the things we were very proud of in our term of government was that the number of child&hyphen;care places increased dramatically&mdash;by some 500 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did that mean? It meant that the government was offering women choices 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9656"> about being in the work force or not being in the work force, bearing in mind that for many families it is not a matter of choice. Like the honourable member for Prospect, I am noticing that children are being withdrawn from child&hyphen;care centres and, because opting completely out of the work force is not an option, they are being placed with people who do not have the training, the skills or the accreditation to look after them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is always happy to characterise people who are unemployed as dole bludgers. It has put in place a horrific work for the dole scheme. It is very happy to light on single parents and say that they should be getting them back into the work force. Under us, the percentage of single parents in employment was pretty healthy&mdash;about five per cent below the intact family percentage, I think, from memory. Increasingly these people are going to find it difficult to get into the work force, to get into employment. People have told me in my office that they are now going to be faced, after getting into the work force and paying for the increased child&hyphen;care fees, with being significantly worse off financially. The family income is being sacrificed to get back into the work force. That is a ridiculous situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem is not confined just to that sort of situation. We all know that the Howard government is shedding full&hyphen;time jobs at the rate of knots and replacing them with part&hyphen;time jobs. You will find that the occasional care centres are often an attractive proposition for those who are in part&hyphen;time employment. They do not want child care for the whole week. They may only want one or two days a week. This is where occasional care centres can play a very useful role.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very proud to have been associated with Gumnut Grove Child Care Centre. I saw it develop out of the John Armitage Centre, where it started. We were able to get premises for it not very far from my office. A group of ordinary women are on the management committee of this child&hyphen;care centre, and the patronage is dramatically falling off. They cannot continue without support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I noticed that the Minister for Family Services (Mr Warwick Smith) was here a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> moment ago. I called his officials to a meeting of the Gumnut Grove Child Care Centre. I suggested that it was ludicrous to see this community based centre go out of business. The department could not make any offers of assistance to keep it running. Probably the only solution to the centre's problems is for Blacktown Council to take it over, because of all the changes that have been made by this Howard government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Occasional care is very attractive for people who are not in the work force but who want a bit of a break from their kids when they go shopping or have a day off. One of the things we are not very good at is giving families a bit of respite from their kids. We give respite care to parents of disabled kids, and I certainly support and encourage that. But, in terms of strengthening the family unit, giving mothers&mdash;in the main, or the caring parents&mdash;an occasional break from their children's constant need for attention is very good for both the parents and the children. This is the other point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These parents can only use occasional care, so putting the bite on occasional care does not strengthen family units. It puts them under more stress. And this is the type of family that the Howard government is obsessed with: that is, the family where one of the parents is working and the second parent is at home. This is the so&hyphen;called `ideal model' of the Liberal family. You will hear them&mdash;the member for Capricornia, for example&mdash;getting up and extolling the virtues of this type of family. I am not so judgmental about it.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But even these so&hyphen;called ideal families are victims of the pressure that has been put on and the possible forced closure of occasional child care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And then there is out of school hours care&mdash;before and after school hours&mdash;where the operating subsidy has been removed. There are several of these child&hyphen;care centres in my electorate, and I am convinced that by the end of the year we are not going to see the same number operating. They are going to go out of business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does that mean? It means that you are going to see an increasing incidence of so&hyphen;called `latchkey children': that is, children 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9657"> who go to school and go home and, when they go home, there is no&hyphen;one at home to look after them. Parents will go through the trauma of worrying about home invasions and about whether or not their child has gone directly home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Is this the sort of family life that Mr Howard envisaged when he said he wanted Australians to feel comfortable? With parents being forced increasingly into having their children as latchkey children, can they be comfortable? Or is this a condition that is specially set out for working&hyphen;class suburbs like the electorates of Lindsay or Chifley or the electorate of the honourable member for Corio (Mr O'Connor). Is this special medicine for us for having a Liberal government?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly every member on this side of the chamber has had a reaction to these child&hyphen;care measures now being introduced by the Howard government. But, because the changes actually have not been implemented, the tidal wave of change has yet to hit. I sincerely hope that the Minister for Family Services, who is at the table, has learned something from the fiasco of the accommodation bonds. I see that he is deferring the implementation of these measures until April. If he is, I welcome that. But he has got himself into one black hole; let me warn him that child care is a second black hole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to conclude on this point: as a federal member, privileged to be in this place, I have always been obsessed about education. Out in the western suburbs of Sydney, the level and degree of education that you get often predetermines your life chances. I have always believed that the children in my electorate are every bit as good as children in any other electorate. But I do say this: I think children are advantaged&mdash;in terms of their social skills and their learning&mdash;by having the experience of attending child care. I believe it gives them a great introduction for their entry into kindergarten.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It may be of utterly no concern to government members that they have ripped out this $800 million from child care in their first budget and that they propose to rip out another $200 million in their second budget. It may be of no concern to them that people 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> are being forced out of proper child care. But the diminishing opportunities for child care, particularly for those of us in the western suburbs of Sydney, mean that, again, our children are getting a second&hyphen;rate chance at life. They need a pretty good escalator for their introduction into kindergarten, into schooling&mdash;it does not matter whether it is long day care or occasional care; it is out of school care if they are already at school. Long day care and occasional care not only give children a great opportunity to socialise, develop their motor skills and learn but also give them a fabulous introduction into kindergarten. The children who go to occasional day care centres in my electorate get those benefits. There is also a great deal of liaison between the child&hyphen;care centre and the primary school the children are going to. Instead of a child fronting up to the school with an unknown personality or characteristics, the school gets a good and professional breakdown of the child. What a great way to start school.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is denying people out in my electorate the opportunity to send their children to child care. How ridiculous that now, under the Howard Liberal government, it can cost more to send your child to child care than it does to send them to a posh private school. It is absolutely ridiculous&mdash;and this is for families who are very dependent on the second income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my electorate I have a lot of Filipinos, and I am grateful about that. I think they are wonderful people. They are great homemakers, obsessive homemakers. They cannot wait to get into a home and start paying it off very quickly. But you will always find that both parents contribute to this great task by working. This group of people think what a wonderful country Australia is. In this country they have the opportunity to acquire a home which would be beyond their wildest dreams in the Philippines. Yet what are we doing to these families when they want to use child care? We are pricing child care beyond their reach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, I say to the minister: you did not develop this policy. Do not fall for the same mistakes you did with the accommodation 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9658"> bond issue. Start to learn what the implications of this really are. If you want to come to my electorate, I will be happy to sit you down&mdash;not set you up&mdash;so that you can talk to those at the child-care centres and to some of the parents. You will then understand first-hand the imposition, the pressure, this is placing on families in a western suburbs electorate. Far from helping children, far from helping families, you are putting a huge burden on them.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;May I once again congratulate the member for Chifley (Mr Price) for his thoughtful contribution to debate in this chamber. What he has had to say has been echoed by other members on this side of the House who are extremely concerned about the adverse effects this legislation will have on the ability of working families to access child care.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say that I feel sorry for the Minister for Family Services (Mr Warwick Smith), who is now at the dispatch box. We on this side of the House regard him rather highly, and it is rather disappointing to see the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) once again handing him a really bad sandwich. He really got the short end of the stick when the Prime Minister said, `Look, you take responsibility for our hopeless, inadequate and devastating nursing homes policy.' Now he has been given responsibility by the coalition government for the carriage of another area of bad policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation continues the Americanisation of the Australian policy landscape. The regrettable thing about the Prime Minister that we have leading this country at the moment is that he is bereft of any original Australian framework that develops Australian responses to Australian conditions. We have seen the Americanisation of the industrial relations debate, the Americanisation of the health debate and the Americanisation of the provision of public services. In the child-care area the objectives of the government are to drive out of the sector those important community child-care centres that deliver quality, accredited child care to working families and to encourage the proliferation of private child-care centres in high socioeconomic areas 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> where they can chase the money and the profits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I am very proud to stand in this chamber and state the achievements of previous Labor governments in the child-care area. A lot has been said by members of the government in criticising the previous Labor government's achievement in the child-care area. I could not enter this debate without challenging some of the rather wild and inaccurate statements that have been made by government members. The member for Chifley summarised the situation accurately when he said that Labor in government had been responsible for an increase of over 500 per cent in the provision of child-care places in this country. The previous Labor government introduced proper accreditation procedures for child-care centres throughout this country to ensure that quality child care was being provided to our young people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might canvass some of the achievements highlighted in the last year of Labor administration in 1995, before we left office in 1996. In 1995 we had five times the number of places that were in existence over the previous five years. Almost 400,000 families were using Commonwealth funded child care in the year before we left office. Almost a quarter of a million families were receiving assistance with child-care fees and more than 200,000 families were receiving the child-care cash rebate. Support for families did not stop there. More than 800,000 families were receiving the parenting allowance, and in that year an additional 51,000 child-care places were provided, at a cost of $162 million, to residents in rural and regional areas so that quality child care was available to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is an achievement that we on this side of the House are very proud of. We will brook no criticism from government members today who seek to rip hundreds of millions of dollars out of the child-care budget. An unjustifiable criticism of the previous Labor government is being levied by government members in this debate. It should be remembered that in the two Howard budgets that have been delivered, this very important area of social policy has virtually been emasculated. In the first budget we saw $820 million 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9659"> taken out of the child-care budget. That process has continued in the second budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Among the people who are affected by these changes are the working families in my electorate of Corio in Geelong. Many of those working families are financially hard-pressed. They fall into the category of the working poor. It is necessary for both parents to work and earn income to sustain the family household. They have faced, as a result of what the government has done, an increase in the fees that are being charged by their community based child-care centres because the Commonwealth subsidy has been scaled back. Now they face the prospect of those child-care centres, which they have been able to access at a reasonable cost, being closed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The message that is being sent by this government to those working families is: `We do not want two of you working. We only want one of you working. We would prefer that the woman in the household stays at home.' That is the message that is being delivered in the child-care area by the two Howard budgets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The income situation of many families in my electorate has been exacerbated by the uncertainty created by the government's industrial relations legislation. It is an absolute mockery for the Prime Minister to now parade himself around this country to workers as the champion of the Aussie battler, saying that his industrial relations legislation has not led to workers being one dollar worse off. That is not the case in practice. The workers in my electorate know that. Not only did they face inadequate wages before this industrial relations legislation was put into place; they now face an industrial relations climate in which their wages and conditions are being wound back as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Developments in the economic workplace have been alluded to by previous members, such as the development of part-time jobs. We have not seen this government in the business of creating full-time jobs. That seems to be anathema to the government, yet it promised that it would continue the high growth in full-time jobs that had occurred under the previous Labor government.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I happened to pick up a newspaper today in which our Prime Minister, in London, was lauding the government's achievements on the inflation rate. Well he might do that because we all know that when John Howard left government in 1983 he left Labor with an inflation rate in excess of 10 per cent. Thankfully, when he came to power in 1996, he was left by Labor an inflation rate of between two and three per cent. We broke the back of inflation in this country and now the Prime Minister, from London, tells the Australian community that this is going to be the platform on which he is going to, hopefully, achieve a four per cent economic growth rate in this country. Let me remind the Prime Minister that, in the last four years of Labor in government at the national level, we averaged a four per cent growth rate over that period. We left that to him and he has not been able to replicate that achievement or sustain it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister, having delivered uncertainty to the Australian work force with a climbing unemployment rate, now seeks to drive out of the work force those people who seek to improve the living standards of their families by having the woman in the household working. Families in my electorate face considerable economic uncertainty. They are not receiving the support from this government that they should in the child&hyphen;care area and the message has been delivered: get out of the work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason why the participation rates have dropped in this country is quite simply that the support that should be delivered by the Commonwealth government, channelled through local governments into community based child&hyphen;care centres, has been withdrawn on a massive scale. John Howard really wants women out of the work force. The sad feature of this particular legislation is that many of them are withdrawing from the work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am really concerned at the effect this legislation will  have on access to child&hyphen;care and the quality of child&hyphen;care provision in my electorate. I have at least five community based child&hyphen;care centres that will be affected adversely by the changes that are proposed in this legislation and by previous actions of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9660"> government. There are nine such centres in the City of Greater Geelong area that will be affected. What the government's actions will mean is a subsidy withdrawal of $350,000 across the City of Greater Geelong. That has occurred and that loss will have to be made up by the City of Greater Geelong at a time when the city's revenue base is being squeezed by restrictions imposed by the hapless Kennett state government in Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The absolutely hopeless mismanagement of the local government sector by the Kennett government has left many municipalities in a very precarious financial position indeed. They are not in a position to shoulder an extra $350,000 burden, which is what the City of Greater Geelong is going to have to find if it is going to keep these community based child&hyphen;care centres open. The only alternative to that course of action is to close those community child&hyphen;care centres down and restrict the access of working people to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has not been an easy task for local councillors in the City of Greater Geelong to meet the demands for services by residents in the face of such state government ineptitude in handling the local government sector. The real danger in this, as I have alluded to already, is that the community sector may fall out of the system in my electorate without substantial Commonwealth support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Honourable members on the other side of the chamber, in supporting the government's legislation, have suggested that Labor governments in the past have not really planned child&hyphen;care developments throughout the length and breadth of Australia and addressed areas of real need. I can tell you what is happening in my electorate. We have seen the proliferation of private child&hyphen;care centres in competition with the community based centres. While those particular child&hyphen;care centres have to comply with planning permits, those private centres in my community are not allocated in response to community demand. There is really no control over where these particular child&hyphen;care centres are being built and there is no attempt to regulate to spread the service to meet community need. What some of these private operators are doing is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> chasing profit in high socioeconomic areas of the city.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My plea today to the councillors of the City of Greater Geelong is not to close those community based child&hyphen;care centres, because they are servicing the needs of hard&hyphen;pressed working families. At all cost, they must make sure that those centres are kept open for working people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much has been said already in this debate about the detail of this legislation. I do not intend to go over that here. But let me say to the minister who has carriage of this piece of legislation that the invitation that the honourable member for Chifley extended to him I also extend.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We consider the minister to be a reasonable and intelligent man. It is not our fault that he has been given all the bad aspects of the last two budgets to carry. Indeed, our sympathies go with him. We know that he had his finger in the pie back there in the 1980s to make sure that John Howard never reached the position of Prime Minister. We know that this is the payback for the minister. We really feel sorry for him; he is an intelligent and reasonable man, and we know that he can grasp, at times, the complexities of the legislation that the government brings forward. We would therefore issue that invitation to him to come into some of the electorates where working people are struggling very hard to make a living. They really need the support of these community based child&hyphen;care centres so that the second parent can work and bring that income into the family and so that those working families can know that their child is going to a child&hyphen;care centre that is accredited and that is providing a quality service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are hearing from these centres is that, in their attempts to come to grips with the massive cuts that have already been introduced by this particular government, they are cutting back on the provision of service. Equipment is not being replaced. Maintenance is not being carried out. Staff who are not trained&mdash;they are well meaning but they are not trained&mdash;are being employed on a part-time basis to cover the loss of trained staff who simply cannot be afforded by these particular centres.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9661">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to pay tribute to the child&hyphen;care workers in my electorate. There is a very professional group of people in my electorate in child-care centres looking after our young. The centres that exist in the City of Greater Geelong are quality centres, especially the community based child-care centres. I want to see that quality retained and improved. It cannot be done while this government is withdrawing funding for those centres&mdash;$820 million in the first budget and another hit in the second budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has a big task ahead of him to cope with the outrage that will come upon the government when this particular legislation comes into effect. He might think he is having a hard time with nursing homes&mdash;and we know that he has aged in the brief time that he has had the portfolio&mdash;but that is nothing compared with what will happen to him when this particular legislation comes into effect on the ground and he incurs the wrath of parents not only in my electorate but also throughout the length and breadth of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although the minister has a pleasant smile and a pleasant countenance in the face of such bad and poor legislation, he will not be able to maintain that pleasant countenance, that happy outlook and that smiling face to the world. He will not be able to maintain it in face of the outrage that will confront him and his government when the working parents of Australia realise and appreciate just what this government has done to them. He might think that the holocaust has arrived with nursing homes, but let me tell him that what is coming up the straight is a tidal wave of parental anger over what this government has done to the child-care sector in this country.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to take this opportunity to make some summing up comments before the House divides on the second reading amendment of the shadow minister. At the conclusion of that, I will be moving two amendments which we have shared with the opposition and which I understand will enjoy their support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, I want to thank all members for their contribution during this debate. Unfortu 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> nately, this debate has been a lengthy one, and therefore I have not been able to sit in and listen to all speakers. I thank them generally for their contributions. I indicate to them that their comments are constructive and will be taken into account in the further considerations that I will bring to bear in this very important area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The  Child Care Payments Bill 1997  brings together into one major piece of legislation some particular elements: the child-care assistance paid to centres under the Child Care Act 1972; the child-care assistance paid to family day care, outside school hours care and occasional care not currently covered by the legislation; and the child-care rebate paid to families under the Childcare Rebate Act 1993. So this is a consolidation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill includes the necessary legislative arrangements for child-care assistance and the child-care rebate to be paid by the new Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency, Centrelink. The bill also implements the child&hyphen;care policy changes announced in the 1997 budget by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) which introduce four clear things: a new child-care assistance arrangement for school aged care; a 20-hour limit on child-care assistance for non-work related care; a 7,000&hyphen;place limit on new private centre growth in 1998 and 1999; and a link between eligibility for child-care assistance, the child-care rebate and age appropriate immunisation for children under the age of seven years. As I mentioned, there will be some amendments which I will speak to at a later time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rapid growth in child-care places has resulted in a dramatic increase in child-care assistance outlays over the past five years. The last two budgets have introduced a number of measures to slow the rate of growth in child-care subsidy outlays while protecting the benefits of low and middle income families as far as possible. As a result, the real rate of growth in child-care outlays will be reduced from nine per cent to three per cent per year, but substantial real growth will continue. I think it is important to understand that real growth continues. Indeed, as the member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) said earlier in the debate, it is anticipated that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9662"> there will be an additional 83,000 new child-care places created over the next four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reforms which are implemented by these bills will certainly simplify the system of child care. That will be welcomed by parents. Parents will only need to deal with one Commonwealth agency, Centrelink, to receive their child-care payments. They will bring most child-care payments within a legislative framework, subject to parliamentary scrutiny. This has not been the case in the past. They will provide strong incentives for parents of children in child care to immunise their children for the benefit of both those children and all the other children with whom they share child care. For the first time, this legislation will put into place a new planning framework to influence the location and rate of growth of new private child-care centres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am grateful for the support of the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) in terms of the value of the incentives to immunise. The member is uniquely qualified to comment on the importance of immunisation, and his strong support on this matter is certainly appreciated. The member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), the shadow minister, has called for the government to reverse its decision to cap child-care assistance at 50 hours. This limit reflects the view of the government that it is not reasonable for the community to support payment of care for more than 50 hours per week, unless it is actually being used for work related purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People who genuinely do need more care in order to work are entitled to assistance for the greater period and in fact do receive this assistance. This limit was first implemented back in April this year. Data from the first quarter after implementation showed that only six per cent of families actually used more than 50 hours of care a week. The only people affected by this change are those using less than 50 hours but being charged for more. Any financial impact on centres and individuals from the 50 hours measure depends solely on the charging practices of individual services. I hope these data help to assist the member for Jagajaga to see what the impact of the policy would be in this area.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new limit of 20 hours child&hyphen;care assistance a week will be introduced for families which do not have work related commitments. This move is strongly supported by the Australian Early Childhood Association, which believes that families should be allowed up to 16 to 20 hours of non&hyphen;work related care per week for children between two to five years of age.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also recognised that families with a child with a disability need additional help. Mrs Moylan, the former Minister for Family Services, announced on 22 September in her address to the Australian Early Childhood Association National Conference that the government had decided to exempt children with disabilities and their siblings from the 20&hyphen;hour limit. I know that the opposition supports that particular measure which will be moved formally in the amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A new planning system, which I mentioned at the commencement of these remarks, to influence the location and growth of new private child&hyphen;care places is a very important part of the 1997 budget child&hyphen;care reform package. Extensive consultations were completed between November 1996 and February 1997 on a range of options as to how best we might approach this matter, including the implementation of new planning limits. A cohesive and integrated child&hyphen;care planning system is absolutely critical to ensure that future child&hyphen;care growth is directed to the area's high work related need. In part, this is the process that will address the concerns raised by the member for Chifley (Mr Price) just a moment ago. What we are trying to do is to make sure that new centres are created in those areas where they are most needed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Planning in child care is certainly not a new concept. The Commonwealth has always planned the growth and distribution of community based long day care centres, family day care and outside school hours care. The government is now extending needs based planning to the private sector, to the benefit of those who will use those centres. There is no point in having a whole range of new centres being built in the wrong locations so that the people who need them do not find it convenient to use them.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9663">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since August this year the Commonwealth has established planning advisory committees in each state and territory. These planning advisory committees involve all levels of government, the child&hyphen;care industry and consumer representatives. I would urge all members of the federal parliament to make sure that they take some interest in the work of the planning advisory committees because they work at the community level where many of the key decisions will be made about the location of child&hyphen;care centres. If we are all concerned in this place to make sure that they are created&mdash;to deal with those extra 88,000 places over the next four years&mdash;I think, as representatives of the community, we could all be enhancing the viability of the proposals that are in this legislation. Their role is to assess the demand for new child&hyphen;care places and to provide recommendations on high need areas by the end of this month.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that some sections of the child&hyphen;care industry expressed concern about the detail of disallowable instruments and regulations to be made under the bills not yet being in the public domain. The previous minister recognised this concern and agreed to issue the instruments as exposure drafts. I am pleased to tell the House that a number of these instruments have already been released for comment by the department at my direction, and the remainder will be released for comment over the next two weeks. My department will be consulting with the industry about these instruments as, indeed, they have been consulting with the industry about the preparation of this legislation extensively over a long period of time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think I should take the opportunity to congratulate them for the extensive work that they have done in the child-care unit in the family services department, because it has not been an easy undertaking, I am sure, to prepare legislation of this extent and this detail and to do it in a way that it is going to enjoy&mdash;even though there is a second reading amendment&mdash;the support of this House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most of this material in the draft disallowable instruments is technical and replicates or replaces current policy contained in disallowable instruments under the Child Care Act 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 1972, the Childcare Rebate Act 1993, administrative guidelines, handbooks and agreements. Importantly, for the first time all of this material will be open to scrutiny by the parliament. So, again, I emphasise the point: with planning advisory committees at the community level and with the disallowable instruments arrangements that will be available to the parliament to scrutinise, the whole planning arrangements and processes of delivery of child care will be available for the parliament to comment on at any time, and I think that is a step in the right direction. It will give parents greater comfort and it will give every member of both this chamber and the other place the opportunity to be involved in making sure that child care is delivered in an appropriate way in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some members have also expressed concern about the removal of operational subsidies from community based long day care centres. That decision taken in the 1996 budget is about equity&mdash;equity between the 200,000 families using private centres which have never received any operational subsidies and the 70,000 families using community based centres that previously received the untargeted operational subsidy. National governments need to take steps to ensure that equity policy is in place. Those community based centres receiving the subsidy of around $20 per week have fees which are only $4 per week less than private centres, and community centres provide fewer places. So, for high cost care, for example, for babies and children with additional needs or for low income families receiving maximum child&hyphen;care assistance and in rural and remote areas, the government continues to provide strong support to the child&hyphen;care sector. Approximately $1.2 billion has been allocated for the 1997&hyphen;98 period and, as I said at the commencement, there is a rapid increase in the number of places&mdash;88,000 in the next four years&mdash;and the policies are designed to cater for that need but also to make sure that child care is better targeted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fundamentally, there is a shift of focus from service providers to parents. There is a balancing between the two and we are supporting that by income related child&hyphen;care 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9664"> payments direct to families, regardless of the type of service they use. There is a multiplicity of services in child care and we are focusing on providing to families the opportunity of a greater choice as to how they meet their child&hyphen;care needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From January 1998 it is proposed, I am advised, to have a child&hyphen;care card to ensure that the payment is used in an approved child&hyphen;care facility. I have not talked this morning at length about quality but, as all would know, we are focused particularly on making sure that quality is a priority in those child&hyphen;care centres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We want a less prescriptive service provision system. We do not want to be so concerned about who provides the service&mdash;public or private&mdash;as long as it satisfies regulation and quality assurance requirements. There has been some mention of aged care, and that is part of what is behind the detailed policy changes in aged care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We want a national child&hyphen;care information system to assist parents make choices. We have to recognise that child care is an issue which touches many families. One of my personal early priorities is to make sure that I am in touch with all of those who represent peak bodies in the child&hyphen;care area to ensure that we have that continued commitment, not just from the government but from those bodies also, to the enhancement of quality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We want to make sure there are safety nets, which I mentioned at the commencement of my remarks, to ensure that families or children who require that additional support are able to access the child care that they require. Indeed, that is the genesis of the amendment that we will be moving shortly about the extension of the 20&hyphen;hour limit to be available for those with disabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that the child&hyphen;care legislation breaks new ground. It has been through a very extensive consultative process. I commit to continuing that consultative process in conjunction with the officers in my department. I would always be keen to hear from those in the industry, and indeed from those in this place, who can see that there are ways to improve this system.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are moving to a time when technology can be utilised in the delivery of child&hyphen;care services. We will see that with the child&hyphen;care card in 1998, which will alleviate the necessity for additional forms. We are moving to a time when the delivery agency Centrelink&mdash;it is a new agency of only three months&mdash;will be involved actively in the provision of advice, dissemination of information, processing of claims and so on. It will be a one&hyphen;stop shop approach, utilising technology. You can ring a 1800 number from anywhere in the country to reach the 400&hyphen;odd Centrelink offices around the nation. A whole new age is dawning for the delivery of services, and child care will be part of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the final points I will make is that concerns were expressed by the opposition, the sector and my own colleagues that a more appropriate starting date for these new reforms would be a time other than 1 January next year. I have heard those concerns. We are moving an amendment today relating to changing the start date to after Easter. I think that that is more amenable to families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I myself have a young family, and I know that 1 January is a time when you like to turn off getting ready for the next year ahead. I think that Easter will give both Centrelink a little more time and certainly the community more time to absorb the rationale behind the changes. There will be some time to look at those documents which now, for the first time, are going to be subject to public and parliamentary scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All in all, I thought that that was a very good and balanced decision. I know that the opposition support me in that as do the Democrats. I know that that amendment will enjoy support also. Finally, I thank again all those who have contributed to the debate. This is a major piece of legislation. I therefore commend it to the House.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">I would like to make two quick points on the bill that has just been read a second time. It will actually create 83,000 new places over 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9668"> the four years, and also the card I referred to starts in 1999. I thank the opposition for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments make two significant changes and three minor technical changes to the Child Care Payments Bill that has just been passed. Both of the significant changes are beneficial to families and have no adverse impact on the child-care industry. One amendment makes additional child-care assistance available to children with disabilities. The 1997 budget measure to introduce a 20-hour per week limit on child-care assistance for non-work related care is implemented through the Child Care Payments Bill 1997. This bill includes exemptions for children at risk of abuse or neglect, families in crisis and families where the sole parent has or both parents  in a couple have a disability. Children with a disability and their siblings were not included in this exemption.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Parents with a child with a disability often require more than 20 hours of non-work related care to fulfil their caring responsibilities towards both that child and other children in the family. Child care is frequently needed for siblings when a parent attends therapy sessions and doctor visits with a child with a disability. The parents themselves are more likely to suffer illness than other parents due largely to the strain of managing the high&hyphen;level support needs of their child, further compounding their need for additional care. This amendment makes sure that these families are not subject to the 20-hour limit by exempting both the disabled children and their siblings from the limit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second significant amendment deals with the retrospective claims for child-care assistance or the child-care rebate made in respect of children who have not been immunised. The Child Care Payments Bill as it stands provides that, where a family makes a prospective claim for a child-care payment and the child in question has not been immunised, the family has a period of 28 days in which to commence the appropriate immunisation catch-up program, to provide evidence of medical contraindication or to declare a conscientious objection to the child being immunised. If they take no action, child-care payments will cease after the 28 days.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment introduces a similar concession for families lodging a retrospective claim for child-care assistance or child-care rebate. It means that, where a family's first claim under the new arrangements is retrospective and the child is not fully immunised, the family will be given the opportunity to fulfil the immunisation requirements I have just outlined and so receive the payment. Families whose child-care usage is too irregular for them to be able to anticipate their needs for child care will, for practical reasons, claim retrospectivity&mdash;that is, they will claim for care already provided. Under the existing bill, if the child is not fully immunised, the family will not be given the benefit of the 28&hyphen;day grace period in which to fulfil the vaccination requirements. This amendment will overcome these problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the technical amendments redefines the term `immunised' to cover children who, while they have not received the appropriate vaccinations under the standard schedule, have had the vaccinations required by an approved catch-up schedule. The second technical amendment remedies an omission by defining the term `secretary' as being the secretary to the department. The third technical amendment flows from the deferral of the implementation date for new child-care payment arrangements to 27 April 1998, which I just outlined in the summing up of the bill just passed. The amendment is required to allow for the allocation of child-care assistance hours to take into account arrangements in existence from the payment commencement date. The other amendment relates to the change in the date.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition does support the government's move to exempt families with children with disabilities and those families where there are children at risk from the 20-hour restriction. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9669"> We do recognise, along with the government, that these families are under significant pressure. We appreciate the government's recognition of this and their move to support those parents. So the opposition is very pleased to support those amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also are very supportive of the government's moves as far as immunisation is concerned. It is the case that this country does need to improve its immunisation rates. The changes that the government has put in place to see that improvement are welcomed by the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also pleased to see that the government has taken the opposition's advice and delayed the commencement of the changes, particularly as they affect out of school hours  care. The government would be aware that there is considerable concern amongst those who are running out of school hours care programs all around the country that the government's changes are going to create considerable hardship both for the services and for the families using those services. It is the case that the government is removing operational subsidies from out of school hours care. The removal of these subsidies is removing the certainty about the incomes that these services have enjoyed. So they do have considerable concern about the changes that are being made and I am sure they will appreciate at least the delay in the implementation of these changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the out of school hour services would prefer the government not to proceed with the removal of operational subsidies. These are services that are at this stage still, to use a colloquialism, run on the smell of an oily rag. They are run very tightly. They certainly do not have any extra fat in their services to cut and they are concerned that, as a result of the government's changes, some families will face considerable increases in fees and, as a result, may take their children out of out of school hours care. This is not something that I am sure the government would want to see. Certainly the opposition does not want to see any return to the past where we had children going home alone, going home to houses where there were no parents.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only way to ensure that that does not happen in the future is to make sure that out of school hours care programs are properly funded. So I ask the government, now that it has acknowledged these changes cannot be rushed through, that in its reconsideration of these out of school hours changes it does reconsider the removal of operational subsidies. This area certainly is not overfunded. It is an area under considerable pressure and one that the government needs to reconsider, given that it has given itself some more time. But, as I said, the opposition will be supporting these amendments.</PARA>

I am sure I do not need to draw this to the attention of our Australian families because they already know. They are right to be concerned about what is happening now and to be concerned about the things that look like happening in the future. Our Australian families, particularly low income families, are facing uncertainty and insecurity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under this government they are right to be concerned that they may not have a job next week. Under this government they are right to be concerned that their already stretched  household budgets may not be able to meet the extra costs that this government has imposed on them. Many have had to spend more because of higher child&hyphen;care costs. We have just dealt with the   Child Care Payments Bill 1997  here in the House which will see many families pay more for their child care. They have had to spend more on increased prescriptions for themselves and their children when they get sick. And they have had to spend more on community care services. If it is the case that they can afford to have private health insurance at all, any benefit they might have got from the rebate has gone in increased premiums.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are also right to be concerned about the future if they are looking after frail, elderly parents because they face the prospect of having to raise the money to pay an accommodation bond if their parents need to go into a nursing home. If they have young children they face the prospect of being unable to find suitable or affordable child care. If they have children aged between 16 and 25 they face the prospect of having to support those older children while they look for work&mdash;work that is not to be found&mdash;or helping with the costs of technical, further or university education. Under the government's new industrial relations arrangements they face the prospect of unpredictable wages and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> eroding conditions. Older families in particular also face the prospect of having to run down their savings, including their superannuation savings, if they become casualties of continuing high unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australian families know that this government has cut more than $10 billion from health, housing, education and social security in its first two budgets, and that means that that money has come out of the pockets of low income Australian families. They know because they are feeling the effects in lower incomes, in struggling harder to make ends meet and in declining quality of the services they use. As one very astute constituent put it to me, `They might have a surplus, but I don't have anything. I don't have a local primary school or hospital any more. My kids can't get into TAFE any more.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us have a look at the specific provisions of this bill, which are also going to make some people worse off. From 20 March next year schedule 1 amalgamates the existing parenting allowance and sole parent pension into a new payment called `parenting payment'. Sole parents are the losers in this arrangement introduced under the guise of simplification.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the new arrangements sole parent families, which I might remind the House are still our poorest families, will lose their payment completely once their assets reach the relevant assets test threshold, instead of having their payment reduced by $3 a fortnight for every $1,000 of assets above these thresholds. More significantly for low income sole parents, those who claim parenting payment having lost their job will have to serve an income maintenance waiting period if they have cashed out annual, sick, long service or maternity leave paid as part of their redundancy payment, and overseas portability of their payment will be reduced from 26 weeks to 13 weeks. There are some current parenting allowees who are winners as a result of these changes, but let us not lose sight of the fact that the net effect of this measure is to take nearly $7 million a year away from low income families with children. Let us not lose sight of the fact that these 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9671"> families are going to lose another $7 million as a result of this government's changes. Simplification this measure is not. It might be changing the name to one name, but there are still two sets of rules.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Schedule 2 makes changes to the child disability allowance. On the positive side, they are changes that we support. From July next year, two children will be able to be added together to qualify a person for the child disability allowance. Secondly, the opposition does support the move to increase the allowable respite days for parents caring for children with disabilities. That is going to be increased from 42 days to 63 days. That measure too is welcomed by the opposition to ensure that parents with children who have disabilities get a bit more of a break.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the negative side, there are a number of changes. From 1 July next year the eligibility  for child disability allowance will be based on a prescribed list of disabilities and a child disability assessment tool. Secondly, the child disability allowance arrears will be cut from 12 to six months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These new arrangements are part of what I can only describe as a concerted assault by this government on people with disabilities. Firstly, we have seen in the  Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Family and Other Measures) Bill 1997 , which will soon be returned from the Senate for our consideration, the introduction of new disability impairment tables to assess people's eligibility for the disability support pension. Thousands of people with disabilities will have to look for work when there are no jobs available even for people who are skilled, educated and able-bodied. These disabled Australians who will be thrown off the disability support pension by this government's new tables will find themselves without any income support at all. Of course, it is not the case that the government is doing anything extra to help these people with disabilities to get a job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, my office has received dozens of calls from the parents of young adults with disabilities about a new crackdown on mobility allowance. Unless people with disabilities 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> are in vocational education or training, looking for work or in employment, they will no longer qualify for this payment. In particular, disabled adults who are in activity therapy or living skills training will no longer qualify, despite their need for assistance to travel to these courses. As one constituent has written:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am sure the government does not understand the ramifications of such action. Whole Day Training Centre transport services will collapse, taxis will lose out and Day Training Centres may even have to close. The disabled will be confined to their residences . . . what are the answers for the disabled who  are disenfranchised from access to our community at large?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Thirdly, we have all the changes that are taking place as far as the Commonwealth&hyphen;state disability agreement is concerned. It is nothing short of a fiasco. This government is now renewing this agreement month by month. It is supposed to be a five&hyphen;year agreement that gives certainty to the states and certainty to those services that are delivering care, accommodation and other services to people with disabilities. By its incapacity to negotiate a decent new agreement with the states for people with disabilities, this government is creating terrible uncertainty in the minds of people with disabilities and in the minds of those who deliver services. It is the case that the government knows there is great need in the community for more and improved accommodation services for those who are disabled, great need for increases in employment assistance and also great need for an increase in day activity centres all around the nation. But what do we have from this government under the Commonwealth&hyphen;state disability agreement? Yet another attempt to take a cut from a very vulnerable group of people and an incapacity to negotiate a decent agreement with the states to ensure that these services are delivered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fourthly, there are the measures that are in this bill before us. So we have a range of ways in which this government is attacking people with disabilities. The government claims that its rationale for its proposals is to change the objective of the child disability allowance from `encouraging family rather than institutional care' to `providing recognition of a child's disability and its impact on 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9672"> the family'. It further claims that a universal rate of payment does not acknowledge those with very high care needs and that tighter targeting may allow greater scope to provide increased assistance to those who need it most. In fact, of course, as is now well known from this government, the rationale is much simpler than that. It is all about saving money&mdash;saving money on the backs of children with disabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is concerned about the increase in the number of claimants for the child disability allowance. They have doubled in the five years to 1997; there are now 102,000 recipients of the child disability allowance. The government claims&mdash;and this is a question which I want to give some detail to, so I ask that, when the Minister Representing the Minister for Social Security (Mr Ruddock) makes his concluding remarks, he help us clarify this point&mdash;that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ABS research found . . . close to 21% of recipients have no handicap, do not require personal help or supervision and have no difficulty in performing self care, mobility and verbal communication tasks.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That comes from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Portfolio Budget Statements </EMPHASIS> for 1997. The government points to the shift in profile of child disability allowance recipients compared with those previously qualifying for the handicapped child allowance. Forty&hyphen;seven per cent of child disability allowance children have asthma, behavioural and learning problems including attention deficit disorder, epilepsy or diabetes as their main disabling condition whereas severe physical and intellectual disabilities predominated amongst the previous handicapped child allowance recipients. Disturbingly, however, the Australian Bureau of Statistics contests these figures. In a letter to the Geelong Community Legal Service, an ABS representative said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have attempted to validate the figure quoted, that 21 per cent of children attracting the Child Disability Allowance did not have a disability or a handicap. The exact source of this figure is not clear but it is not supported by data from the 1993 Survey of Disability, Ageing and Carers.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As I said, I would appreciate the minister clarifying this matter for us in his concluding remarks; it is obviously a very significant 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> point if it is not the case that recipients of this allowance have no disability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I want to talk about the effect of these changes which of course will tighten eligibility for the child disability allowance. The government estimates that 4,000 fewer children will qualify for the child disability allowance each year and that the changes will save a considerable amount of money. This is another area that I would appreciate clarification from the minister about because we have seen two different figures in different places in the budget papers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Portfolio Budget Statements</EMPHASIS>, the government talks about savings of $97&half; million over the next four years. These savings, as I understand it, will result from children no longer being eligible for the child disability allowance and from the change in arrears. I would appreciate the minister clarifying the exact amount of savings that the government anticipates and the government breaking that down for us into those who will no longer be eligible for the child disability allowance and how much the government expects to save as a result of changing the arrears arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the savings from the changes to the child disability allowance will be used to fund additional support for carers, and there is no question that the Labor Party, along with the government, does acknowledge the vital role played by carers. We certainly do support additional assistance to these people, but we do not think that this additional support should be provided at the expense of children with disabilities or their families. As with many recent government changes, the impact of these measures will fall most heavily upon women because they constitute 93 per cent of recipients of the child disability allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to take the opportunity to remind the House that this is not the first time that the government has tried to cut child disability allowance arrears. The government's attempts to cut arrears from 12 months to three months was rightly defeated in the Senate late last year. We argued then and we continue to argue that parents take some time 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9673"> to have their child's disability diagnosed and, importantly, we need to recognise that it does take a considerable period of time for parents to come to terms with the implications of their child's disability. It can take a considerable length of time for them to establish what their child's needs are and to realise that they are having to provide the extra care and attention sufficient to qualify them for the child disability allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time that these families are struggling to come to terms with the changes that a child with a disability can bring, when they are more concerned about getting and giving the best possible care for their child and when, frankly, dealing with Centrelink is going to be the furthest thing from their minds, they are being asked by this government, as a result of this change today, to be quick off the mark&mdash;to get down to Centrelink and claim the child disability allowance quickly or lose out on up to six&hyphen;months payment. That is the impact of the  changes that we are debating here today. The opposition has opposed this measure before, and we will oppose it again. Again, let us not lose sight of the fact that the net effect of these changes will be to take money away from families who have children with disabilities. These are families who are already under enormous pressure and this government, as a result of these changes, is going to make this pressure worse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Schedule 3 of the bill before us today makes 255 amendments to the Social Security Act to change the name `family payment' to `family allowance'. I will be very interested to hear the government's rationale for this change. I cannot understand it; it seems to be entirely oriented to taking up the time of this parliament. I remind the House that the last time the payment for children was renamed `family allowance' was in June 1976 under Prime Minister Fraser. Certainly the Liberal and National parties seem to be very keen on sticking to their name `family allowance', even if it requires 255 amendments. That will also require a massive reprinting of information products and forms, all at taxpayers' expense, and the money involved could much better be spent on supporting families&mdash;for 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> example, those who have children with disabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Schedule 4 standardises the arrangements for determining when `severe financial hardship' can be invoked to waive ordinary, income maintenance and liquid assets waiting periods. A person must have liquid assets of no more than two weeks payment. For income maintenance and liquid assets tests they must also demonstrate that they are in this financial predicament because of what is, in the view of this government, `unavoidable and essential expenditure'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unavoidable and essential expenditure includes replacing or repairing your fridge but does not include buying your children a new pair of shoes. It includes money for food, housing and utilities, but it is not clear whether it will include the cost of taking your child to the dentist for a check&hyphen;up or to buy a new pair of glasses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This kind of paternalistic attitude is typical of this government. Put any way at all, the people to whom these arrangements apply are either families who have less than $600 in the bank and no prospect of income or single people who have less than $350 in the bank and no prospect of income. By any definition, these people are poor. They need this community's help and the support of this government. They do not need the sorts of changes we are seeing in this legislation. We should not insist that our public servants make judgments about the worthiness of helping people who are so obviously poor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Schedule 5 extends the health care card eligibility to disabled children who do not otherwise qualify for the child disability allowance and bases the health care card eligibility on income averaged over eight weeks&mdash;it is currently based on income averaged over four weeks. The opposition will not be opposing these two measures. However, we are concerned about how the administrative arrangements which will have to be put in place to provide health care cards for these children with disabilities will work. This is another question which I would appreciate the minister responding to.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9674">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Who, if not Centrelink, is going to determine that a child has a physical, intellectual or psychiatric disability which is likely to be permanent or to exist for an extended period? Who is then going to determine that, because of that disability, the child needs a level of care and attention on a daily basis that is substantially more than that needed by a child of the same age who does not have a disability? If the minister could respond to that, we would appreciate it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Schedule 6 amends the Data Matching and Tax Act to replace references to specific social security payments with a generic reference to payments under the Social Security Act so that data matching can continue when the government introduces a new payment such as parenting payment or when it changes the name of a payment to, say, `family allowance'. Amendments also allow information to be provided to source departments with tax file numbers intact and via on&hyphen;line transfer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the government's rhetoric about ensuring that such transfers of information are  to be made by secure on&hyphen;line connection to protect people's privacy and to ensure that personal information is not able to be used for unauthorised purposes, the amendments do not require the on&hyphen;line connection to be anything, let alone secure. Labor's amendments in the Senate will insert the requirement that this transfer happen by secure on&hyphen;line connection. During consideration in detail of this bill we will be interested to hear the government's explanation of how the Privacy Commissioner interprets these provisions and to hear whether or not any concerns have been expressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will conclude my remarks by saying that there is little in this bill which gives low income Australian families any hope for the future. This is more of the same from a government which has already run out of new policy ideas and which shows no inclination to improve the lot of Australian families. This Howard government continues to take money away from Australian families, and this bill is yet another example of that. It is yet another example of a government which is only concerned about the bottom line and not 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> about the state that Australian families find themselves in. To that end I move the following second reading amendment to this bill:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>

Therefore, if you are going to draw such a long bow to deal with trusts, perhaps we should not be discussing things to do with taxation since we all deal with taxation. Where do we draw the line in the sand?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I simply wish to make the point that we in this parliament, on both sides, should be dealing with issues such as the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Parenting and Other Measures) Bill , running the country and doing what is best for the nation, not making political points which have no relevance to the wider community and which, quite obviously, are not to do with the good governance of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is a continuation of the government's improvements to the social security system which has been seen, after many years of Labor, to become a most convoluted excuse for a system which is no longer representing the needs and the aspirations of the wider Australian community. We have set certain goals, aspirations and objectives when dealing with the Social Security portfolio&mdash; the single largest expenditure within the budget. We wish to see the efficiency of the service improved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To this end, we have introduced Centrelink which combines many of the different facets of payments to the wider Australian community. We have seen greater accountability enforced and, to this end, we have seen a large amount of money retrieved on a weekly basis&mdash;some $20 million&mdash;from a combination of social security fraud, overpayments and administrative glitches.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also seen the streamlining of our service delivery so that, with such things as the youth allowance, we have combined a series of payments into far fewer payments, simplifying access to the social security system for Australians. Most importantly, we have ensured that the limited resources&mdash;Australian taxpayers' money&mdash;are best directed to those genuinely in need of support from the Australian tax system. These are all commendable objectives with which this government and this minister have set about 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to ensure the social security system does represent a system that the Australian taxpayer is happy to contribute towards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This particular bill, the  Social Security Legislation Amendment (Parenting and Other Measures) Bill 1997 , has six schedules, and I would like to take issue throughout with some of the points made by the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) in misrepresenting some parts thereof. The first section relates to the parenting payment. In particular, it goes towards some of our objectives of ensuring that we get rid of complexities and simplify the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new parenting payment introduces a single payment for parents by replacing sole parent pension and parenting allowance from 20 March 1998. The sole parent pension has always very much had a social stigma attached to it. For whatever reason, there are many people in this community who receive a sole parent pension who are embarrassed to actually state that. By removing that name, I think we make a very clear indication of the social conscience that we as a nation should have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The parenting payment recognises a person's child&hyphen;bearing responsibilities, irrespective of their marital status, and treats parents in a far more consistent way&mdash;and I thought it very belittling of the member for Jagajaga to somehow deride such an objective. The new payment achieves greater equity between lone and partnered parents. The member for Jagajaga was quick to point out that the mobility restrictions that we placed on sole parents had been reduced, but she did not point out that the restrictions on parents, those in a partnership, had been expended and, in doing so, made the two uniform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To make that quite clear, a sole parent was able to travel overseas for a period of 12 months or 52 weeks and continue to receive the sole parent benefit while out of the country whereas a parent who was part of a couple was able to receive such a payment for only 13 weeks before it was discontinued. In recognising that the role and responsibilities of parents are not dependent upon whether they are single or a couple, we have ensured 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9676"> that that particular requirement is now uniform for both situations. We are also reducing resident requirements for lone parents from five years to two years, with immediate access to the parenting payment for those who become a lone parent while an Australian resident.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is the application of an income maintenance period for lone parents under which lump sum payments, such as accrued annual leave and long service leave&mdash;as mentioned by the member for Jagajaga&mdash;are treated as income for a period equal to the period of leave to which the payment relates. This simply means that, if someone who has been employed takes three months long service leave and another month's worth of holiday pay, they are not able to access the social security system until they have used that money for that period of time. To me, that is fair and equitable. It shows that these people have been paid and that there is no reason for them to be on the social security safety net&mdash;not the gravy train. There is a big difference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new payment simplifies administrative arrangements&mdash;and this, once again, goes  back to our objectives of addressing the need to simplify administration, saving money in this area and ensuring that the funds are directed and end up in the hands of the people who genuinely need it. It provides continuity of income support for parents whose marital status changes. If someone who is single becomes partnered again, they no longer have to reapply; they simply will have their payments changed, and there is less administration and less chance of there being a miss in payment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to remember that the core conditions of the new payment, such as the rates, income tests and concessional cards, are all maintained. Consequently, lone parents will be paid parenting payment at the pension rates, they will be subject to the pension income test and they will be entitled to concessions that are available to pensioners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Moving on to the next schedule, relating to the child disability allowance, this was the focus of much of the attention from the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> member for Jagajaga. She pointed out that somehow we were giving a tough time to people receiving child disability allowance. In the first instance, she referred to tables that had been put forward in a previous bill. This meant that unemployed people in Australia would now be subjected to a table so that it no longer would be a hit and miss affair whether or not they were able to receive a disability allowance and in fact had to fall within certain categories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She said that people categorised as `very low disability' who at present are receiving disability pension would be removed and thrown back onto the unemployment heap. I think this really flies in the face of what we are trying to achieve in Australia. We all appreciate that there are not enough jobs. There were not enough jobs for 13 years; we reached over one million unemployed. That is certainly not the situation today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What it means is that if a person genuinely is able to work and has some minor disability we are condemning them to a life of unemployment if we do not take them off the disability support pension, place them back into the employment market and provide them with some skills, support and training, which this government is dedicated to, ensuring that they can have a fulfilling role within Australian society rather than saying: `Let us hide them from the social security and unemployment figures and keep them on a disability support pension.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have brought in with me today some comments from different groups around Australia on the changes that we are introducing to the child disability allowance. I would like to quote from some of them. This is the Australian College of Paediatrics:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian College of Paediatrics has asked me to the proposed changes to the Child Disability Allowance. I think first and foremost it is important to say that the intention to change the criteria is welcomed by paediatricians in general. Paediatricians have been concerned about the apparent inequities of the previous system, whereby families of children with apparently minimal disease have been successful in being awarded the allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is believed that the proposed system is fair and the proposals as suggested are reasonably complete. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9677"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This flies very much in the face of what the member for Jagajaga was leading to us to believe, but she has the form in this matter of not necessarily stating the real situation. The Asthma Foundation writes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Congratulations on your paper outlining the new assessment tool for Child Disability Allowance. We can appreciate the work that has taken place since the start of the review . . . It is not easy to produce a review of an area that carries with it such sensitivity in the community.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is a sensitivity which the member for Jagajaga is always wont to heighten. The Western Australian Deaf Society states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is particularly pleasing to note that hearing loss of greater than 70dB will be considered a manifest condition as of July 1998. This will certainly eliminate the previous issue of discrepancies in awarding CDA to deaf children and is a welcome amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have reviewed the CDA assessment questionnaire and find this tool to be a much more reasonable and appropriate form of measurement.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And there are others. This measure, part of a broader carer reform package, will improve the targeting of financial assistance to individual carers. It will increase the adequacy of payments to those with the largest caring loads and help ensure flexible but consistent customer service. The important point to  remember is that if a family is unfortunate enough to have more than one disabled child, both having disabilities of a minor nature, we will be adding the two disabilities together to recognise that there is an additional workload in that family, an additional caring need, and the disability allowance would then apply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The CDA reform package also contains several other components, including a reduction in the period for which arrears are payable and an increase in the number of days for which a parent or guardian can place their child in respite. Once again recognising the extra special needs of these carers, they will now be able to place their children into care for 63 days a year and still be able to receive the additional assistance. Previously it was just 42 days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Far from what the member for Jagajaga has outlined, this government is very much aware of the needs of the disabled and their carers, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and through budget measures and this measure has shown where our care and responsibilities lie. Once again, in her speech the member for Jagajaga mentioned the change to the family payments to family allowance. I think she said that the Prime Minister was then Mr Fraser, in 1996. I do not think he was Prime Minister then; he was a little earlier than that. I am sure that was a freudian slip.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My understanding is that the description `family allowance' was used from 1987 to 1992 under the Labor government. The reason for the change is quite simple. The change of name amendment will allow families to easily understand their entitlements. On both sides of the House we have constituents come to our offices who struggle constantly with their entitlements, unsure of these changes. Because we have combined the sole parent pension and the parenting allowance, to become known now as the `parenting payment', we felt it appropriate, to save any confusion, to go back to the name that I know I and many others have used, and that is family allowance. So there is a clear differentiation between the two and that confusion is removed. There are no substantive changes to the nature of the current family payment. The point was raised that there were 255 amendments. We were simply referring to the name change. There are no amendments. No scare campaign can be mounted on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Schedule 4 amendments apply to consistent hardship rules to ordinary waiting periods, the liquids assets test period and the income maintenance period. To put it simply, the rationale for this is that currently there are three separate criteria to be undertaken when determining people's eligibility for hardship. At present the provisions dealing with ordinary waiting periods, the liquid assets test waiting period and the income maintenance period, all provide for the waiver of the periods when they cause severe or significant hardship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, these waiver rules vary depending on which provisions apply. Once again, it just creates confusion and anxiety amongst the people who are most in need. Our attempt here is to simplify and streamline it. It is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9678"> estimated that approximately 50,000 customers will benefit from this measure by having part of their waiting period waived. Customers who are unavoidably in severe financial hardship will have their waiting period waived all together. Common rules for determining hardship and waiting periods are easier for customers to understand.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal simplifies waiting periods by adopting a standard rule and allows the waiver of part or all of the waiting period due to hardship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When a customer of Social Security goes into Centrelink and states their situation, they are not familiar with the legislation, they are not familiar with all of the ins and outs and they do not necessarily describe it 100 per cent accurately. They get given information by Centrelink on one of the three provisions. It turns out that it was not the provision that they were requiring. They are given, in their view, the wrong information. By simplifying this there is now one rule for all, which means that that situation of uncertainty cannot arise.    </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment to the Health Insurance Act will ensure that any child with a mild disability whose parent or guardian loses or would lose qualification for the child disability allowance through the introduction of new  qualification criteria is still able to retain their eligibility for a health care card to cover the cost of pharmaceuticals, treatment, aids and applications. That is a most important thing to establish. There should be no dispute from the opposition that this is necessary because they are the big cost items. They may not have a major disability but the cost of maintaining their health is a very important problem faced by many parents, and I am sure this amendment will therefore be most welcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also amending, in relation to the health care card, the income test. As it currently stands, for an itinerant worker who generally does not work over Christmas, for argument's sake, we look at the last four weeks of their income and assess that, yes, they are eligible for a health care card, and of course that is for six months. But they could well do this knowing that they are going to be back at work shortly after receiving the health 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> care card, on above average weekly earnings, and that they would therefore not be eligible for it. We have simply extended this period to eight weeks so that we can have a good look at what the pattern of employment is and whether or not there is a real requirement for the health care card.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is about ensuring that the Australian taxpayer's money is going to people who are genuinely in need, not those who have been able to use the system to their own advantage. There is a clear difference. The Labor party in government, and still in opposition, fail to realise that the average Australian believes that we all have rights and responsibilities when accessing the public purse, in particular the social security system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final amendment relates to data matching. The data matching program has been in place since 1991. It has been very successful in identifying incorrect payments to social security recipients. It has been further extended under this government, and that has ensured that we are collecting a greater number of anomalies, if we can put it that way. I know the opposition does not like us to refer to some in the community as defrauding the rest of us, but that is reality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The various terms referred to throughout the data matching program are defined in the bill. These include the term `assistance agency', which is defined to include, among other things, the Department of Human Services and Health. This reference is no longer correct, however, as the department is know known as the Department of Health and Family Services. It will thus be amended. It is a straightforward and simple amendment which has no negative impacts and a negligible financial impact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, this bill is just another in the series that this government has introduced not in a mean spirited way, as painted by the member for Jagajaga, but in a way that will provide equity and accountability, ensuring that the very limited resources provided by the Australian taxpayer are directed to the people most in need. I do not think any fair&hyphen;minded Australian can disagree that these are the sorts of objectives that any responsible 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9679"> government should have for taxpayers' money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I reiterate that we are about improving the efficiency of the service. That, as I said, has been done through the introduction of Centrelink, greater accountability of taxpayers' funds, streamlining of the service so all of the recipients find the system easy to access, and ensuring the resources are directed to those genuinely in need. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is just wonderful. Isn't that terrific? Now we understand what they mean by `selling the accommodation bonds': do not tell them the whole story. One would imagine, hearing the member for Longman (Mr Brough), that this legislation is driven solely by concern and care for those who are affected. The funny thing is that it is actually driven by money. If that were not the case, how come the money is being cut? What we have here is more of the 1996 budget, finally coming back to the surface and now being painted in the most glowing terms. And there was a nice touch of hypocrisy. The reason for changing part of the name is the stigma that is attached to it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The same speaker went on to talk about people on the gravy train. For a year and a half, this government has castigated, bagged, labelled and stigmatised tens of thousands of good Australians, good immigrants and good aged people in all kinds of ways&mdash;and they do it every day, day in and day out. Then they talk about family values and about how they are helping families. The hypocrisy is awesome. Now I can understand what they mean by `better marketing' of the accommodation bonds, because they can do that&mdash;they have no trouble with their conscience. They do not say, `The system we are putting forward is faulty, therefore we should change it.'  They say, `The system we are putting forward is shonky, therefore let's sell it better.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am reminded of an incident some years ago that the then Senator Button used to recount. He was talking to the CEO of one of our major automotive manufacturers about a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> particular model of car. The manager said to Senator Button, `It is a real lemon. It is a dreadful car. We have a big problem with it.' John Button said to him, `What are you doing to do about it?' The manager responded, `We are going to have a major marketing campaign.' That is what the government are doing. They have a bagful of lemons from their budget of 1996, and what are they doing? They are out marketing them, pretending that they are all sweet. You cannot change a dud.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation is aimed at saving money, not at making things better for people. It if was making things better they would be helping people more. The fact is, people are going to miss out on the child disability allowance. We do not know how many yet, but people who would normally have received it will not get it. The government is going to save money on sole parents. They say that this is somehow making the system better and fairer. So we get the flip side of the gravy train&mdash;the idea that Australians are not fair&hyphen;minded; that people are cheating, rorting and ripping off the system; and that they are not entitled to it. The pure hypocrisy is awe inspiring.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last week members of the government finally started to understand the age accommodation problem. It finally sunk in. Rather than then saying, `Let's fix it because it doesn't work,' they all started complaining that the minister was not selling it well enough. No wonder politics is held in such low esteem. Quite frankly, the people in the community understand that. They can see the pure cynicism and hypocrisy of that. It is oozing out of the place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was summed up yesterday when Doug Moran and members of the government talked about bludgers; silvertails squatting in nursing homes. They said that people should have to sell their houses before they go into nursing homes so they do not become silvertailed squatters. The people in my electorate who are aged and who own their own homes are invariably women. They have been widows in some cases for many years. The idea that they have to sell their house to avoid becoming a silvertailed squatter bludging in a nursing 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9680"> home is disgraceful. It is an appalling concept. Not only is it inappropriate policy; it is obscene. And the government wants a big campaign to market it. The government wants to spend lots of taxpayers' money gilding the lily&mdash;not the lily but the rot that is inside it. It wants to spend a lot of taxpayers' money  pretending that it is a good thing. What an obscenity!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the first six or eight months or the first few months after last year's budget, I did not mind hearing the contributions of the new government members because they were new. They were not aware of all the details. They had not had constituents come to them and explain how things worked. Their ignorance was understandable and their naivety was allowable. But we cannot make allowances any more. They know, as we know, that this is nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All those government backbenchers know, as we know, from their constituents that what they are doing to people who require support, who are unemployed, who are aged, frail and ill and who have children with disabilities is obscene. They are being told this virtually every day and in some cases many times a day. The letters they are getting we are getting. The hide of ministers in this chamber in recent weeks to suggest that cases have been made up is unbelievable. I suggest they go and answer their letters. That is one of the  problems: we are not getting answers. We put forward letters from constituents with these problems and we do not get answers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister pretends that they do not exist, that they are fictitious. They are not fictitious. We know that, as do the government backbenchers, but they are trying to pretend to the community at large that these are fictitious, that we are scaremongering. What surprised me is that it has taken the aged community so long to become vocal. Many of these changes were announced in August last year, over 12 months ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of those changes was back here today: the pushing back of the arrears payment for the child disability allowance to 12 months. This is a savings measures. It was in the budget last year, and it is back again. It was 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> defeated in the Senate and it is being brought back again. That is how persistent they are. If they lose this year, they will bring it back next year. If they lose it before this election, they will bring it back if they are re&hyphen;elected in the next parliament. Do not be mistaken into believing that they will have a change of heart. These people are committed to these views, and they will revive them and recycle them. Anybody who thinks that the coming changes to aged care would not be revisited in the next parliament under a Howard or Costello government should think again. We are voting on issues today which were first announced in the budget last year, which were defeated in the parliament and which have been brought back. You can forget any idea that these people are learning from their mistakes because they are not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is making savings in this legislation from people with children with disabilities. These are the so&hyphen;called dole bludgers, the welfare frauds and the gravy train people. These are the people who have apparently not been accessing the system fairly. They have been manipulating income over eight weeks rather than four weeks. If people lose their income, they lose it. Pushing up the test to eight weeks is a savings measure. It is not a welfare measure or a support measure; it is a way of saving money. Every time we see a headline about savings on welfare, just remember where the savings are coming from. We are making savings from people who are aged, who are unemployed and who have children with disabilities: the worst off people in our community. That is where the savings are being made in the main.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last two budgets the government has saved $10 billion from that group of people. As all members of parliament know, they come to your office and say, `I have not cheated. I am not a fraud; I am not a crook. Why am I being treated like this?' I wonder what government members are saying in response. I find it awfully difficult, and it is not my fault; I voted against it. I knew what the government was doing. I wonder how those who voted in favour of it explain themselves.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9681">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wonder how those opposite will explain it to the families in their electorates who miss out on the child disability allowance&mdash;the one they are about to vote for. I wonder how they will explain it to their constituents when they ask, `Why can't I get it? I would have been able to previously. Why did you change it?' Will they talk about the Beazley black hole? What kind of melodramas will they use? More importantly, how do they explain it to themselves? Their constituency understand that, if they can rationalise that, they can rationalise anything. In other words, the double standards that this government is putting forward are overwhelming.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have saving measures dressed up as a simplification; saving measures dressed up as preventing stigmatisation; and saving measures dressed up as making a fairer system. The fact is that you can respect it for a little while, but eventually both the community and those opposite know and understand that this action is deliberate. The government is deliberately deceiving the people of Australia by pretending that these measures are in some way aimed at benefiting the recipients. When one looks at this government, all the way through one looks for the inverse. Whenever a minister says, `This is good for the people on this system,' look carefully, look really closely because usually you will find that it is not. We have been here through debate after debate and the same things recur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) moved an amendment, and I guess I am speaking more to the amendment than to the legislation itself. But, as someone who has dealt with community problems and with the departments for some time, when I hear a member of the government talk about simplification via Centrelink, I know what that means in my electorate. It really means a cut in services; it really means there are a lot fewer people doing a lot more work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I quoted in the House not long ago one of the senior staffers of the Department of Social Security who telephoned my office to advise that she was leaving because she could not take any more. She was not leaving simply because what she was being required to do was unfair, unjust and totally unpalatable but 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> because their staff had been reduced and there were fewer of them doing more work. We saw the marketing campaign for Centrelink&mdash;and I wonder how much that cost the taxpayers&mdash;on the pretence that it is a better system. It is not a better system; it is a cheaper system. It has fewer people doing more work. Centrelink is simply a saving. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have coming towards us now is a common youth allowance. It sounds terrific. It is a simplification&mdash;why have more than one allowance? It is actually about saving money. What the government is really saying is that families with children between 16 and 18 who are not in full&hyphen;time training and education&mdash;because there are not enough places, by some 30,000 or so&mdash;will have to look after them. Forget their income, it does not matter. Forget the internal tension in the family. Forget the fact that the child may have a learning disability. Forget any of those things. Those children are their responsibility; they are no longer ours. Those families with young adults up to 21 will have any income support means tested on Austudy rules. This is not a simplification; it is actually a massive saving.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That implies that those families should not need support. It implies that they are on a gravy train, as we heard earlier. The implication all the way through is that people who are being supported by our community are somehow inappropriate, somehow improper and are somehow getting a benefit that we should not be giving them or that they should not be asking for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The whole implication of that is that we are giving out charity&mdash;we are going back to the last century where our welfare system was a charity system. If you were really down and out and had no hope at all, no dignity and no self-respect then the charities would give you a bit of a hand, the soup kitchens would give you a meal. That is the way it will be in the future. There will be no sense of right as a member of society who has contributed, in many cases, for all of your working life, and then have to pay for the nursing home your taxes built. If you are trying to learn and have a disability or some inequality, education is not an entitlement. You have no rights any 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="9682"> more. You get benefits only if you really are in an undignified mendicant position. So we are going back to the charity model of last century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Step by step every bit of legislation cuts away a bit more. What is it all in the name of? You are either a charity case or you are on the gravy train. That is the simple analysis; you are one or the other. If you are not a charity case then you are on the gravy train, and you should not be on there. People are being told this over and over. What is happening is that people are reluctant, people are withdrawing and not putting themselves forward. And we wonder why there is a sense of insecurity, alienation and despair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On all the figures available on the economy, our employment rate should be growing enormously. Why isn't it? Because out there there is a sense of frantic despair. Uncertainty, insecurity and alienation are growing daily, and  you can sense it. For those of us who know our electorates, we know. If we walk down the streets, what are people saying to us? They no longer feel confident. Part of that is because they are being told on the one hand that they themselves are bludgers or on the other that if they are not all the people getting benefits are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was a very succinct letter in the newspaper recently which I thought put it very well. It applies right across so many areas. It said something about the 10&hyphen;point  plan taking 400 pages of legislation but that it was all summed up in a biblical statement that one should not covet thy neighbour's possessions. That is a really interesting way of putting it because right across this legislation, right across this government's philosophy, is this concept that people are somehow cheating, that people are somehow trying to rip off something that they should not be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there is a sense that all people are doing things wrong&mdash;whether it is in aged care, in unemployment support or in children's disabilities. Of all the people in our community the most vulnerable are children with disabilities. They are caught up in this philosophy, in this new radical Liberalism with a capital `L'.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Jagajaga moved an amendment condemning the government for its assault on low income Australian families. Remember those figures? They have taken $10 billion in two budgets essentially from low income families&mdash;and there is more to come. The forward savings in hostels and nursing homes in particular are really quite substantial. Those savings will grow because there is an iceberg effect. They will actually accelerate. So the savings that are being talked about will, in years ahead, be much greater.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Somehow the idea is that our aged people want to become squatters in nursing homes and are silvertails because they own a house in Wickham, Tighes Hill or Islington. They have probably lived in the house for 60 or 70 years. It has all the family memories and history in it and their late husband probably built half of it&mdash;and perhaps did so more than once. Those women are being told that they have to sell the house, because if they do not they are hoarders or will become silvertail squatters in nursing homes. That is what this government has been saying. If one looks at the comments on the public record by Mr Moran and his company about the aged care changes and then starts working out who gets the savings and where they go to, it becomes fairly clear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government says simplification; I say hypocrisy. The government says improving the system; I say ripping people out of it. The government says people are manipulating; I say it is the government that is actually rorting. These people are our society and community. They have needs. They are entitled to fairness and decency. From this government they are getting neither. They are simply constantly getting the argument about budget cuts and budget savings and this legislation should be opposed.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous speaker, the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris), was talking about all sorts of matters in his contribution today. He was talking about matters relating to aged care, to families and to disabled children. When are we going to get some decent conduct from those opposite in the debates before us in this place on a daily basis about matters important to groups in our community? When are we going to get an opposition that ceasefires on this unbelievable ongoing scare campaign, picking on vulnerable groups in our community, making them feel more and more insecure, creating greater insecurity and uncertainty in the broad community, and impacting on people's desire to get on with their lives and invest in themselves, their businesses, families, friends and, indeed, their country?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When are we going to get an opposition that stops picking on older Australians on a daily basis, gladly trying to garner votes over the emotional carcasses of a generation that has given so much to this country, which has survived depression, wars and created a legacy for people of my generation? When are we going to get an opposition that starts to deal fairly with the facts, instead of daily getting on the wireless, on the television and in the press continuing to perpetuate rumour, innuendo and mistruths, all of which are hurting everyday Australians?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous speaker suggested that any cutback in expenditure had to be bad. Mr Deputy Speaker, I submit that, if throwing money at problems in this country had indeed  solved problems in the past, then the previous Labor government would not have had one thing left to be fixed. When we came to power there were that many things lacking and wanting, and throwing money at a problem simply does not fix it. Looking at the individual needs of individual Australians and attempting to get a bureaucratic framework that accommodates that variety of needs and aspirations is really about fixing the problems in this country; not just throwing money at it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Newcastle has stated today that he is against those students who decide to stay on through to year 12. He is against the common youth allowance. That is an 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> initiative by this government to help those who, because of financial circumstances, may have been tempted to leave secondary education to go out and work like some of their peers. The previous system encouraged them to just simply leave school and go on the dole. Of course, the common youth allowance will reward those students who choose to stay in high school to better themselves and, of course, in time the entire community. It also recognises university students in the same sort of way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Newcastle&mdash;I imagine he is speaking for all of those opposite in the Labor opposition&mdash;is against such fairness. He is against convenience for Australians as far as Centrelink is concerned, the one&hyphen;stop shop approach which allows in a lot cases elderly Australians and everyday Australians in general to be able to access government services in one location, instead of traipsing all over town. He seems to be against Australians being treated as individuals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It really disappoints me to see the honourable member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) getting to her feet every day in this place and continuing to hurt people in my electorate, elderly Australians who are very frustrated and concerned by the quite ridiculous over&hyphen;the&hyphen;top headlines that she generates each day. I do not blame the media for reporting her. After all, she is using an elephant man type of approach to draw attention to herself&mdash;anything for a vote.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to deal now with this bill. I think it was important to put on the record in this place my absolute contempt for the disgraceful scare campaign that the Labor opposition quite knowingly and quite devoid of all the facts keeps embarking upon daily in this place. It is certainly part of my job&mdash;and in my electorate I am doing my bit&mdash;to dispel Labor's lies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill contains measures that were announced in the 1997-98 budget and also one non-budget item. This really is all about fairness. It is all about simplification. It will introduce a single parenting payment which replaces the current sole parent pension and the parenting allowance. This new payment will start on 20 March next year. It simplifies 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9684"> income support arrangements for parents whether they are partnered or not. People with child rearing responsibilities after all will be well supported by this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This measure also aims to remove the stigma, which is often attached in our society to those who receive a sole parent pension, by putting everybody under one status. If you are a parent, whether you have a partner or not, your child is important and this government is supporting you through these measures. In practical terms the parenting payment aligns the various conditions under the existing payment schemes and, as a result, arrangements are simplified for the administration of this program, especially for those people whose status moves from lone to partnered parenting and, of course, in reverse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After all, it is the children who suffer under the current arrangements which Labor left us. As people's status change, parents have to cancel one payment before they can access another. The basic standard conditions for accessing these payments&mdash;income testing, rates of assistance and concession cards&mdash;will continue. I do not understand what the member for Newcastle was saying in his contribution. After all, a parenting allowance, as well as the sole parent pension, has in the past&mdash;as will this new payment&mdash;been paid to assist in the raising of children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new single parenting payment is a sensible and just measure by the Howard government. It recognises a parent has a responsibility for the caring and raising of their children, regardless of marital status. It  is certainly consistent with the hallmark of this government&mdash;simplicity, commonsense, people focused and fair. This bill also amends social security allowance provisions aimed at simplifying the hardship rules which apply in relation to the ordinary waiting period, the liquid assets waiting period and the income maintenance period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor left us a raft of rules of waiver for various waiting periods in the legislation and they were certainly very inconsistent. They had different definitions of hardship and different types of expenditure were considered. It was very confusing and very 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> difficult to administer and everyday Australians deserve better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill makes the amendments necessary to introduce a common approach and a commonsense approach at that. The hardship rules are standardised. The first requirement, severe financial hardship, has a simple test and that is summed up in these words, `is a person's readily available funds less the appropriate fortnightly rate of allowance.' It is very simple to follow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also fixes up some other unfairness which was left by Labor when it comes to the liquid asset waiting period. Unlike Labor, we recognise the need to allow this to be partially waived. This will align the liquid assets waiting period provisions with those applying to the income maintenance period. For both these particular aspects, the liquid assets waiting period and the income maintenance period, the simple, easy to follow requirement is that the expenditure which caused the severe financial hardship must have been unavoidable and essential&mdash;things such as emergency medical treatment or perhaps the mortgage rent payments falling due in the waiting period. They are real life examples of what goes on and what individual Australians face every day and every week. These are matters which the Labor Party had chosen to ignore during its time in office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This whole thing is fair. This is all about caring about the particular circumstances in which individual people find themselves from time to time. This is not a cold bureaucracy crushing people, as those opposite might like to suggest. It is not about a bureaucracy crushing people when they are at their most vulnerable. This is just another one of those sensible measures which the Howard government has undertaken which the Labor Party never took. We have heard this morning that throwing money at a problem fixes it. We now have $10 billion worth of reasons to show that that was never the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of these changes, this bill amends and also simplifies the data matching program assistance and the tax act 1990. It will remove references to specific payment and program types dealt with by the social 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9685"> security portfolio and replace these with a generic reference. This will remove the need to make legislative amendments each and every time a new payment is created or an old payment is removed. Other amendments will also be made to the act to streamline the administration of the program. Therefore, not just the end user&mdash;not just the Australian who receives the benefit from the government&mdash;but also the process and the system will be simplified and streamlined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of this reflects a sensible, caring and downright decent reform and yet another one that this government has introduced in so many bills. It is certainly reflected in this bill. This bill makes sensible and decent changes which will also help the parents of children with disabilities. Significant reforms in the area of child disability allowance will come as a result of this bill. A simpler assessment process and child disability assessment tool will be used for all new claims for child disability allowance from 1 July 1998. This assessment criteria will measure the impact of a child's disability on his or her functional ability, communication, mobility, self-care and community living standards against developmental milestones.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Longman (Mr Brough) in his contribution today read a number of references and endorsements from organisations around this country which applaud the fact that the government has recognised the range of disabilities which exist in Australia today and that there are many individuals with their own individual disabilities which need assessment and this government has acted. The measure will also  assess a child's behaviour, emotional state and special care needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not a matter of keeping people simply as numbers within a system and applying the criteria that they either get it or they do not. This is all about helping individuals and treating them as individuals. This is all about helping children who are profoundly deaf and helping people with attention deficit disorder. This is all about looking after the extra special needs of children and also their parents and their carers.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are making child care available to parents and carers at a greater rate than the Labor Party did. It is up to 63 days and my mathematics tells me that is a 50 per cent increase on Labor. The Montrose Home for Crippled Children in Queensland, which is just outside my electorate, has said that this new assessment tool appears satisfactory for use by their clients and they have mentioned a number of other matters. They applaud the need for a list of manifest conditions to provide fast track entry into the program for children with severe disabilities which are unlikely to improve, and they also hope that this will obviate the need for full-scale regular review of these children's entitlements. After all, the emotional state of parents and carers, not to mention the children involved when they have to face ongoing and needless reassessments as their condition deteriorates or improves, is something this government wants to try and alleviate with this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The assessment tool is a simpler, more objective means of assessing eligibility for child disability allowance than the current criterion of `substantially more care and attention'. It is a more objective method of assessment for parents and treating medical professionals. It is meant to minimise the subjectivity and inconsistency of the current criteria&mdash;the criteria the Labor Party left us. It will reduce the number of reviews and appeals. It will increase the level of understanding of the program by staff, parents and the medical profession. This is a measure which will address matters Labor ignored for years in office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of this bill, parents with very disabled children, who have been concerned that the child disability allowance payment has not worked properly over recent years, have reason to be happier. The reality of it all is tough enough for them without the bureaucracy and the system making matters worse. So, as a result of this bill, we have set the rules. We have acted. We have listened to what those people have told us and we have done something about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not a matter of throwing more money at a problem. It is a matter of using resources correctly and ensuring the problems are 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9686"> solved. I said in my first contribution in this place last year that maintaining a system in itself seems to have been the basis of government up until the Howard government came to power. We are all about getting outcomes&mdash;outcomes for people and outcomes which make sure this country and its people benefit by the process of taking tax dollars, expending them and targeting them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A list of manifest disabilities and a list of chronic medical conditions attached to the assessment tool tables will provide fast&hyphen;track entry to the program and less frequent medical reviews. This is something which will be welcomed by parents of children with disabilities. Those who have already received the child disability allowance will be protected by a five&hyphen;year savings provision. We will also increase the number of days allowed in the temporary cessation of care provisions and a reduction in the maximum period for which child disability allowance arrears are payable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill also seeks to amend the Health Insurance Act 1973 for the purpose of health care cards. A couple of changes are there. The first is a part of the major overhaul of the child disability allowance. Due to the amendments to the child disability allowance qualification criteria for a disabled child, some parents or guardians may not qualify for child disability allowance so, instead, we assist those children by maintaining their eligibility personally for a health care card.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently there is an assessment period of four weeks over which a person's income is assessed for the purpose of determining whether they are a low income, disadvantaged person who is eligible for a health care card. The second measure in these changes is that  the government is extending this to eight weeks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, in a procedural sense&mdash;though it fits the theme of this bill in this government by making changes that are simple, straightforward and easy to understand&mdash;we are changing the term of `family payment' to `family allowance'. Again, it is a sensible and people&hyphen;focused measure to help people more easily understand their entitlements and indeed the social security system itself&mdash;a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> system which became cumbersome and impersonal over the years of Labor; a system which seemed to perpetuate its own importance rather than necessarily generating proper outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Various terms have changed over the years. `Family allowance' was part of the lexicon and probably still is, even though it was an term used to describe family payment entitlements between 1987 and 1992. But the term `family allowance' is, as described in this bill, a non&hyphen;discriminatory, straightforward and self&hyphen;descriptive one&mdash;one which will be appreciated by those parents who have partners and those parents who are sole parents in their own right. It will help them in the sense that it will remove the temptation from some small&hyphen;minded people in our community to unfairly label parents who are running the difficult battle of raising children on their own. It will remove the stigma they face quite often, unfortunately, in their daily lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is a sensible bill; it is a sensible measure. I guess, given the weeks of scare campaigns we have heard in this place from those opposite and, unfortunately, throughout the media across the country, it makes sense that the Labor Party will oppose anything that is sensible and that helps people. All they want to do in relation to the measures within this bill is distort the facts&mdash;or talk about anything else but the facts in an attempt to grab another headline and in an attempt to hurt more people. Today they have added parents of people with a disability to their list of those whom they are trying to scare. They have added those people to the list today in an attempt to cause them emotional harm and grief. They have added them to a list to try to garner some additional votes in a vain attempt to play politics with sensible measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think all of us in this place should act in the best interests of this country. This bill certainly does and it is a great pity those opposite continue to try to create scare campaigns, continue to try to create excuses as to why this government has had to act and has had to crack down on things such as social security fraud to the tune of $19 million a week&mdash;$1 billion a year. We have taken the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9687"> challenges that have been issued to us by many people in Australia. We have listened to their concerns; we have acted, and this bill certainly proves we have acted. Those opposite should stop their scare campaigns and get behind this government and assist us with our job of running this country well. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The bill I have just presented is a historic development for the parliament. It provides, for the first time, for the establishment and administration of a separate Parliamentary Service to support the operations of the houses of the Australian Parliament. The staff at present providing the parliament with its support services operate under administrative and staffing structures established by the Public Service Act 1922; however, it has been decided that the parliamentary administration should have its own legislation which recognises and mandates that the primary obligation of Parliamentary Service staff is to serve the parliament as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Parliamentary Service Bill follows as much as possible the philosophy, content and structure of the Public Service Bill 1997, which changes significantly the structure of  public service employment, with certain modifications necessary to ensure the independence of the parliament from executive government. It establishes an employment framework which mirrors that proposed for the Australian Public Service generally and provides specifically for the reciprocal mobility of staff between the two services without loss of accrued entitlements. Arrangements will also be put in place to ensure mobility 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> for staff currently engaged under the Members of Parliament (Staff) Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are significant differences between the Parliamentary and Public Service Bills which recognise that staff in parliamentary departments serve the houses of the parliament. That distinction is reflected in the first object of the bill which is to establish an apolitical Parliamentary Service that is efficient and effective in serving the parliament. The Parliamentary Service Bill contains a statement of Parliamentary Service values and a Code of Conduct, provides for the appointment of a Parliamentary Service Commissioner, makes specific reference to the offices of Clerk of the Senate and of the House of Representatives, and provides for appointments to those offices. Tenure as clerk of either house will be for one 10&hyphen;year period. The bill also stipulates conditions for earlier termination of those appointments. Occupants of the office may retire earlier once they attain the age of 55 years. Secretaries, other than clerks, are to be appointed by the Speaker and the President for five&hyphen;year terms with termination arrangements similar to those applying to secretaries of executive departments. There are transitional arrangements to ensure the continuation in office of current heads of parliamentary departments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also creates the new office of Parliamentary Service Commissioner with a role similar to that of the Public Service Commissioner. The Parliamentary Service Commissioner will have the task of advising the Presiding Officers with respect to the management practices and policies of the Parliamentary Service and, if requested by the relevant Presiding Officer, of investigating and reporting on specific issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In broad terms, the Presiding Officers will have the same employment powers as ministers under the Public Service Bill with advice from the Parliamentary Service Commissioner. Consistent with the need to preserve the independence of the clerks as impartial advisers, the Clerks of the House of Representatives and the Senate are not to be subject to direction from the Presiding Offic 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="9688"> ers in relation to the nature of their advice provided with respect to either house, to members or to committees. Secretaries of parliamentary departments, including the clerks, cannot be directed in relation to the exercise of their powers in respect of specific individuals. The Presiding Officers will have the power to give secretaries of parliamentary departments, including the clerks, general directions relating to the management and leadership of the Parliamentary Service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the bill provides specifically that the Parliamentary Service Commissioner is to be appointed separately and independently by the Presiding Officers, it is expected that normally the same person would fill both of these offices. This would assist in ensuring overall compatibility and consistency between the two services. However, the bill specifically provides that the commissioner cannot be subject to direction by executive government in relation to the Parliamentary Service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secretaries of parliamentary departments, including the two clerks, are to have the same employment powers as those proposed for departmental secretaries in the Australian Public Service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As mentioned earlier, the bill incorporates a legally enforceable Code of Conduct and a statement of Parliamentary Service values. These values reflect the fact that staff serve the houses but in other respects mirror those of the Public Service Bill, with a parallel reference to the requirement that employment decisions in the Parliamentary Service be based on merit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, this bill gives legislative effect to the decision that the parliamentary administration should not continue to be covered by the standard Australian Public Service Act. It establishes a statutory framework and administrative arrangements broadly consistent with  those for the Public Service while incorporating the changes necessary to accommodate the unique circumstances of serving the houses. It provides the houses with a set of arrangements which will allow them to continue to attract and provide a career for those staff who will be equipped to deliver the high level of service the houses currently enjoy.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is presently considering the recommendations made by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts in its advisory report on the Public Service Bill 1997, and it is expected that any amendments accepted by the House will be applied in the relevant instances to the Parliamentary Service Bill in order to preserve the parallel nature of employment conditions and to ensure the unfettered operation of mobility between the two services.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The previous speaker, the member for Moreton (Mr Hardgrave), said that we never made decisions to make these cuts when we were in government. We certainly did not. We did not prevent 4,000 families with children with disabilities from receiving those benefits, which this bill, the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="r288">Social Security Legislation Amendment (Parenting and Other Measures) Bill</XREF> , will do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Moreton spoke about organisations endorsing what this government is doing through this legislation. Organisations that do not endorse this government get defunded. Organisations that do not agree, develop policy, have ideas, go against&mdash;or threaten to&mdash;what this government does will be defunded. This government is a mean&hyphen;spirited government, as evidenced by this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I rise to speak on this bill, I am increasingly aware that I am one of the fortunate in our society. I am employed, in general good health and relatively young. I know that I am fortunate, because barely a day goes by when my office does not receive at least one phone call from a constituent who is having problems in making ends meet, including buying food, paying the electricity, the car insurance and the registration, the medical bills and the chemist fees&mdash;the list goes on. Many of these people are pensioners: sole parent pensioners, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> aged pensioners, disability support pensioners and carers of the ill and infirm.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill seeks to replace the sole parent pension with a parenting allowance, partly to reduce the social stigma of being a sole parent receiving income support. I do not know if this bill will achieve that, but I am sure that renaming something is not going to help people who are struggling to survive on a fixed income. Some of the stigma comes from people on that side who are constantly attacking people on benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Struggling families will not be assisted. They will have to follow some very complex and intricate guidelines. To attack the parents of children with disabilities is particularly underhanded. Within this bill's recommendations, 4,000 fewer families with children with disabilities will qualify for child disability allowance because of the new prescription list of disabilities and the use of the child disability assessment tool; 4,500 families will lose up to six months arrears of child disability allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like the aged care legislation, the government is forcing this legislation through without providing the details of the prescription list of disabilities and of the child disability assessment tool. It is a fact that pensioners in all categories, but particularly the aged and the sick, are doing it very tough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A low inflation and interest rate environment, coupled with increasing wage rises, means that people on fixed incomes are always going to fall behind&mdash;and they are. Low interest rates, welcome as they are, do nothing to help pensioners pay for increases in basic foodstuffs. Low inflation does not take into account things such as charges for home and community care services, which have increased under the present state government in Tasmania, and increases in prescription costs and nursing home charges. These taxes by the Howard government are taxes on the family, the elderly and the sick. Pensioners, who did not even receive the benefit of the September CPI increase, will help pay for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No&hyphen;one would dispute that low inflation is a good thing. The Treasurer (Mr Costello) can 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9690"> give thanks to the previous government for the record lows announced this week. It is perhaps time to revisit the idea of using the CPI as the official benchmark for living standards because, in my view, it is beginning to fail.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With some foresight, the previous government commissioned a study by the Social Policy Research Centre to review budget standards for Australian families, including pensioners. I await with interest the final report from this research, because I suspect that it will confirm that the CPI has had its day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the parliamentary break I had the opportunity to visit some of the hamlets that make up my large electorate. Many people that I spoke to told me how hard it was to keep up with increases in the cost of living. If you read the papers today you will see that there are no cost of living increases, yet everybody knows that the cost of living is increasing. Somewhere along the line something is wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Pensions are not being increased to meet the cost of living because we are saying that there is no increase in costs, inflation is in decline, interest rates are right down and, according to the CPI, there are no cost increases. Somewhere along the line the CPI is failing the test, because these people keep telling me that their cost of living is increasing and that they have to find more income, which is difficult because they are on fixed incomes and benefits. Therefore, their standard of living is falling even further behind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The unofficial benchmark of male total average weekly earnings was subject to debate in this House earlier in the week. I am pleased that the government has legislated Labor's long&hyphen;running practice of pegging pensions to a minimum of at least 25 per cent of the total average weekly earnings. I am also pleased that we, in opposition, were able to remove the government's proposal to impose a five&hyphen;year sunset clause on this  legislation. This proposal exposed the cynicism of this mean&hyphen;spirited and fiscally obsessed government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How else would an outside observer interpret the unrelenting attacks that this government has made on the most vulnerable and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> disadvantaged groups in our society? How else would an outside observer interpret the defunding of organisations set up to represent the interests of pensioners? What a mean&hyphen;spirited thing to do! An organisation which gets a very small amount of money to run a national office and which represents the aged in Australia has been defunded.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The parliamentary secretary and member for Braddon uses the term `miserable'. That is a good term to describe his government. I would have thought that someone like him, a fellow Tasmanian, might have stood up in the party room and had a go. But I do not think that there are too many on his side standing up in the party room and having a go against the executive that is imposing these harsh decisions on the people of Australia; people who are less able to defend themselves. How else would an outside observer interpret the scrapping of the Commonwealth Dental Health Service and the enforced selling of someone's home just to enable them to get a nursing home bed?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government's retreat from the basic principles of human compassion is to be deplored. But don't just take my word for it, read the papers. You will see that churches, community organisations and social commentators from across the political spectrum are condemning the ruthless attacks by the government on those least able to defend themselves. When Mr Howard was elected to the highest office in the land, he promised to govern `for all of us'. The shallowness of this statement is now obvious to all. Australia is fast becoming a country divided through a lack of leadership and an abrogation of the fundamental responsibilities of public administration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a Tasmanian, it saddens me greatly that the two people who have had primary carriage of much of this legislation, which is proving so destructive to the fabric of our society, come from my home state. The member for Bass (Mr Warwick Smith) and Senator Jocelyn Newman have betrayed not only their own constituencies but the rest of Australia as well. Of all people, I would have thought that they at least would have understood the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9691"> impact of their proposals on people living in rural areas, so many of whom must contend with the problems of isolation and the lack of amenities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, if they have forgotten&mdash;as they seemingly have&mdash;I remind them that it is not uncommon for me to hear of instances in my electorate where age pensioners living in rural areas have had to resort to getting food vouchers so they can afford to put petrol in their cars to travel to the city to get even basic medical attention.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BV5">Mr ADAMS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for Braddon thinks that this is a very funny situation. I will clarify for him what I meant. People need to get a food voucher so that they can afford petrol for their car in order to gain other services that they might need, such as taking someone to receive medical assistance. In areas that I represent, there are many pensioners who live in small hamlets and isolated areas where there is no public transport whatsoever. They need to maintain a vehicle to have any sort of mobility.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that these people will soon be unable to even afford to keep their cars on the road. Perhaps, further down the track, the same people will have to sell their homes just to get a nursing home bed in an area hundreds of miles from where their families live. They may be forced to live at the other end of the state, well away from any family support and miles away from where they originally grew up and have lived most of their lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In recent times, a constituent of mine, who is living with his elderly and frail wife whom he cares for just outside one of the small areas in my electorate in the middle of Tasmania, has been told that he has to pay an extra $10 a week towards his community service home help. For a lot of people $10 a week is not a considerable amount of money, but for people on a fixed income, such as a  pension, $10 a week&mdash;for two visits at $5 each visit&mdash;is a considerable amount of money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This man is on a fixed income. He has to run a car in order to take his wife to the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> doctor, to buy medications or merely to do basic household shopping. There is no public transport and no other means of transporting him to the nearest town. But he has been told by the people that run home and community care that he would have to sell his car to meet his obligation of $5 a visit for community home help. I think that it is very unfair, that it is unjust and that it should not occur. But it is occurring. I believe that it reflects the policies of this government and its meanness to ordinary people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> There is no dignity left for people who have to struggle to find $10 to enable their partner to have basic health care. This is not helping families stay together. This sort of attitude is becoming the norm rather than the exception in dealing with older people in our community&mdash;user pays whether you can afford it or not under this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Someone ought to remind the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) that many Australians currently receiving income support, especially in the form of the age pension, built this country with the taxes they paid during their working lives. Many others defended this country in times of conflict, and most brought up a new generation of Australians in very hard economic times. They have already invested their taxes in what should be a reasonable retirement. We owe them our respect and our support, but all this government is able to offer is excuses and a harsher climate to live in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> This bill once again is attacking families, particularly those with children with disabilities and adding to the difficulties of sole parents. These changes cannot be seen in isolation from other parts of the social security system. Those who have the misfortune of having to rely on government assistance are not being dignified or helped to get out of their poverty traps&mdash;these changes merely entrench them further&mdash;and the Australian battlers who might have been heartened by the Prime Minister's promises during the election have become Howard's forgotten people, forgotten by this mean-spirited, nasty government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Listening to the contribution made by my colleague opposite, the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Adams), one could have been forgiven for thinking that he had forgotten that he was supposed to be addressing the provisions of the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R345">Social Security Legislation Amendment (Parenting and Other Measures) Bill 1997</XREF> . This bill seeks to implement mostly budget measures&mdash;and one non-budget measure. It also seeks to implement changes which have been widely accepted in the Australian community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I am very disappointed when I hear those opposite try to suggest that somehow this government is responsible for all of the social problems that we have in Australia. It is interesting to note, Mr Deputy Speaker, as you personally would know, that the former Labor government was in office for 13 years, yet the suggestion is that all of the social problems we have in Australia in 1997 have somehow been caused by the policies of the coalition since its election in March 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> This particular bill makes a number of changes which will improve the administration of our social security system. This legislation is not designed to hurt those people who are underprivileged or to pull away the social safety net. It is designed to make some very practical changes which are compassionate and which will improve the administration of the social security system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill before the House will introduce from 20 March 1998 a new income support payment, the parenting payment, which replaces the sole parent pension payable to lone parents and the parenting allowance payable to partnered parents. Labor suggests that we are not looking at the circumstances of those people who are greatly in need. However, this is a very compassionate, sensible and logical change. It will ensure there is not discrimination between those people who are married or in a marriage&hyphen;like arrangement compared with those who are sole parents. It naturally will reduce the social  stigma which currently exists for persons on the sole parent pension.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new payment will also simplify administrative arrangements, particularly in the case of parents whose marital status changes. Under the existing law, when a person's marital status changes, a new application must be made for a payment. But the purpose of the payment in the case of both sole parents and married parents is exactly the same&mdash;to assist in bringing up children. This very important change simplifies and clarifies the government's policy. It is a very important change, and I endorse it wholeheartedly. This new payment will improve equity between sole and partnered parents. It is important to note that, despite what those opposite have said, core payment conditions such as rates, income tests and concession cards are maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This piece of legislation will also make some changes in relation to the area of the child disability allowance from 1 July 1998. The bill will reform the qualification provisions for the child disability allowance, increase the number of days allowed in the temporary cessation of care provisions and from 1 January 1998 reduce the maximum period before a claim for which arrears of child disability allowance is payable. These measures are part of a broad carer reform package which will improve the targeting of financial assistance to individual carers, increase the adequacy of payments to those with the largest caring loads and help ensure flexible and  consistent customer service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new qualification criteria will provide a simpler and more objective assessment regime for children with a disability through the use of a new child disability allowance tool and a prescribed list of recognised disabilities. The prescribed list will also assist in cutting red tape for children with severe medical conditions or disabilities. The Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) is to be commended for this particular change. We must always be in favour of cutting red tape to ensure that assistance gets through to those people in need. The changes to existing legislation introduced by this bill will certainly make a major contribution to that end.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9693">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> It ought to be noted as well that existing recipients of the child disability allowance will be protected through the insertion of a five-year savings provision. The change in the child disability allowance arrears provision from 12 months to six months will assist in bringing it into line with other social security payment provisions, while still allowing a generous period of arrears to be payable, thus introducing even more consistency into the social security system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The extension of temporary cessation of care provisions from 42 to 63 days will help to standardise respite care provisions and will provide additional assistance to those caring for families with disabilities. The non-budget measure is the change of name from `family payment' to `family allowance' from 1 April 1998. While this has no financial impact, it will assist customers to understand more easily the social security system and their entitlements, because many families still use the term `family allowance' that was used to describe `family payment entitlements' from 1987 to the end of 1992.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also important to appreciate that this bill applies consistent hardship provisions to the ordinary waiting period, the liquid assets test waiting period and the income maintenance period from 1 July 1998.

It fills me and many others in the community with a deep sense of sadness and disappointment to hear of a case where a man has been acquitted of assaulting his wife and two unknown women because the court ruled that drunkenness prevented him from being responsible for his actions. It is examples like this that undermine the confidence that Australian women and men have in their protection by the law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Assault is a states and territories offence. However, the Commonwealth is interested in the general welfare of the community, and it has participated in the development of the model criminal code which deals with many state offences. The so-called drunk's defence to an assault charge still sadly exists in Victoria, South Australia and the ACT. Under Commonwealth law, however, this does not apply, because the Commonwealth follows the model criminal code.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Standing Committee of Attorneys-General decided in 1994 that the model

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CT4">Mr COSTELLO</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. The preliminary ABS figures released today show that full-time adult ordinary time earnings rose 1.6 per cent over the three months to August and 4.1 per cent over the year. That was somewhat in excess of market expectations, although it should be noted that in fact the previous 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9698"> quarter had been considerably lower than expected&mdash;the rise had been 0.3 per cent&mdash;and it may well be that the strong rise in the September quarter was partly as a consequence of the lower preceding quarter. The stronger growth in the AWOTE in the September quarter could well be because the timing of wage increases was held back in relation to the living wage claim safety net adjustments and it may well be that a few major bargaining negotiations have flowed through in this quarter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The importance of the figures, however, is that we in Australia are now at a time of historically low inflation. Yesterday's figures, the best figures since 1962, the best figures in 35 years, showed an underlying inflation rate of 1.5 per cent. If wages are moving at around four per cent, either they would have to be based on very high productivity or, alternatively, they could cut into profits. One of the consequences of cutting into profits could be a response in relation to overall levels of employment. So it is very important not just that inflation be low but that inflationary expectations fall as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I urge employers in Australia who are looking at their wage settlements in the course of the forthcoming year to bear in mind that, on an inflation rate of 1.5 per cent, a 1.5 per cent increase in wages would maintain purchasing parity. Any additional wage increase should be based squarely in relation to productivity. If it is not based squarely in relation to productivity, that does have the basis either to cut into profits or eventually to put inflation pressures back into the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are preliminary figures. These are figures, as I said, which over the course of the year are within the range which the Reserve Bank and the government have been targeting. But for a quarterly figure they are quite high at the level of 1.6 per cent. It is important, if we are to obtain the full benefits of low inflation in relation to the employment situation in Australia, that wage outcomes are consistent with low inflation. That will take a great deal of adjustment. For many people in business who have not seen an inflation climate as good as this one, because we have not had one for 35 years, that will involve

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous government, through the now Deputy Leader of the Opposition, commissioned Tom Sherman to conduct an inquiry into additional evidence that came forward, I think from recollection, in 1995. Mr Sherman, who is respected by all sides in this House, conducted a very professional inquiry. He visited Portugal and other parts of the world. He met with officers of my department. I think he took evidence from something like 33 different people. It was a very extensive inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to add one thing, that is, it has often been argued that the Australian government had intelligence information which was of great significance to the circumstances surrounding the deaths of the five journalists. Bearing in mind the controversy there has been for many years about that intelligence material, I did agree to allow Mr Sherman to investigate that material. The member for Moore can read Mr Sherman's conclusions in the Sherman report.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9699">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I regarded the Sherman report as an extraordinarily good document. I think the opposition would agree with that. It was very comprehensive. But we cannot keep having inquiry after inquiry after inquiry into this incident, which very tragically occurred some 22 years ago. The previous government and the present government&mdash;whatever you can say about previous governments before that&mdash;have behaved very responsibly on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have asked the Indonesians if they can provide us with any more information. They have said that as far as they are concerned the matter is closed. All members of this House know that I cannot force anybody to provide information. We have given all parties the opportunity to contribute through the inquiry by Mr Sherman and, frankly, I do not think there is much of great use that the Australian government can do except to say that if new information is brought forward we are always happy to have a look at it.</PARA></ANSWER>

I know that this whole issue of climate change is one that he has a great deal of interest in and I am sure that the constituents in the electorate of O'Connor, more broadly, have an interest in. Certainly Western Australians do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia welcomes the fact that President Clinton's announcement of the US negotiating 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> position for Kyoto reflects the particular national circumstances of the United States and unequivocally rejects the European Union's 15 per cent reduction proposal. All three majors, the United States, Japan and the EU, now have their own different emission targets on the table, demonstrating that differentiation is the only workable outcome for these negotiations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While we are still studying the details of the US proposal, Australia agrees with the underlying principles and three essential elements of the United States position. First, we do agree on the need for realistic and achievable targets. Secondly, there must be flexibility to reduce emissions through cost effective, market based approaches. Thirdly, we fully agree that Kyoto must provide for future developing country commitments on limiting their emissions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Climate change is a global problem and it does require a global response. The call yesterday in Bonn by the so&hyphen;called G77, the developing countries, for a 35 per cent reduction in emissions by developed countries by the year 2020 with no parallel obligations for developing countries is unrealistic and environmentally a poor outcome. The House may be interested to know that by 2020 it is projected that developing countries will account for about half of all global emissions. So obviously developing country emissions will have to be addressed if we are to be serious about addressing the overall problem of climate change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The House knows that the Australian government is prepared to pull its weight to address the issue of greenhouse emissions and the question of climate change. We are in the process of doing that and we want an outcome in the negotiations which is fair and equitable but which is going to be effective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for O'Connor also asked about some statements made&mdash;which appeared on Australian television last night&mdash;by the British Minister for the Environment, Michael Meacher, that were critical of Australia's position. Can I say in response to that, first of all, that our Prime Minister had a constructive discussion yesterday with Prime Minister Blair about this issue.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9700">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, can I say that I find it, and the Australian  government finds it, very difficult to understand why it is that the British government is asking Australia to reduce its emissions by 15 per cent but it is saying that the Portuguese government can increase its emissions by 40 per cent; that the Spanish government can increase its emissions by 17 per cent; and that the French government does not have to reduce its emissions, yet France is the world's fourth largest economy. So, when the British government asks us to reduce our emissions by 15 per cent, we ask why they do not ask the French to reduce their emissions by 15 per cent, or the Portuguese to do the same, or the Spaniards or the Greeks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are looking for a serious and equitable solution to this problem and one that is fair&mdash;fair to Australia and fair to other parts of the world&mdash;and one ultimately that involves developing countries and achieves some sort of overall global solution to the problem.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In fact, this fax was Labor's secret plan to destroy the common youth 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9701"> allowance. What it reveals is that the Labor Party has no regard whatever for truth or the facts when it comes to public debate on these important issues that affect jobs for young people. It is only interested in playing political games with the lives of young people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me spell it out for the people of Australia. Labor is against the youth allowance. Just as it opposed work for the dole and the principle of mutual obligation, it is against giving a positive message to young 16&hyphen; and 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds that their future lies in investing in their own education and training and improving their skills. Labor supports young people dropping out of school and going on the dole. That is absolutely clear from this secret plan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this plan reveals is that what Labor has in mind and what the member for Batman has in mind is another vicious campaign of misinformation to scare young people around this country. They have spelt it out in detail. They are going to go around the country telling young people that the government has cut $270 million off vocational education and training and that apprenticeship and traineeship opportunities in this country are declining.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the truth? The truth is that vocational education and training expenditure under this government is up $144 million over the spending in the last year of the Labor government. The fact is that the number of new apprenticeships and traineeships has risen now to 98,000 in 1996&hyphen;97, the highest ever and up 20 per cent over last year. But the most alarming part of this secret plan is that Labor's plan to get young people jobs is to bring back Working Nation. This is the limit of the capacity of the member for Batman. He says, `We are going to get young people back into education or training or work through active programs of assistance, as previously implemented under Working Nation.' We have caught you red&hyphen;handed!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the member for Batman wants to bring back is this failed $10 billion spending program which demoralised a generation of young people through short&hyphen;term training programs, and of course this proposal follows hot on the heels of the proposal of the mem 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ber for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith to add $8 billion to the foreign aid bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Does the Leader of the Opposition know that his ministers are planning these massive new spending programs? Or has he totally lost control of what is happening on his side of the House? The fact is that he is a weak Leader of the Opposition; he has no knowledge of what is going on on his side of the House.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"> This contrasts with what happened in Tasmania under the regime of the former government, when the Labor Party was in charge and more than a thousand jobs were lost in the rail industry. Now the rail industry in Tasmania has a very bright future with a new direction. I quote from an article on 19 October in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Examiner</EMPHASIS>  headlined `Upgrading planned': The Commonwealth sold the Tasrail operation for $22 million in August. The new owner, Australian Transport Network, a consortium which consists of some of the world's biggest and most respected narrow&hyphen;gauge rail operators&mdash;plans to `double freight carried within five years'.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>  on 13 October quoting Mr Ed Burkhardt from ATN said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">ATN is committed to spending $20 million but plans to outlay $40 million over the next four years, which will mainly be spent on locomotives, tracks and wagons and other infrastructure. Some Tasmanian lines may be re&hyphen;opened and others upgraded.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to comment on the processes. As the member for Parkes mentioned in his question, with the wider reform in rail across Australia, I think it is to be recognised that the reforms which were started by the former minister and which I propose to continue will have great benefits for the economy right across Australia.</PARA>

Where is the public interest&mdash;to take just one example&mdash;in enabling the sister, nephew or niece of someone with a family trust to transfer into that trust property income of half a million dollars, to write that off against accumulated losses in the trust of that amount or more, and then get back the half a million dollars distributed to them tax free?

<ANSWER PAGE="9709" SPEAKER="Thomson, Andrew, MP" NAMEID="FB6" ELECTORATE="Wentworth" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Sport and Tourism;Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Sydney 2000 Games" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FB6">Mr ANDREW THOMSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question and I commend him for his interest in this topic. No doubt all members of the House would regard the notion of drugs in sport as a very pernicious one. Drugs in sport is a matter not merely for governments but for all sporting organisations and for all of those people who participate in sporting competitions. As far as the federal government is concerned, we have the Australian Sports Drug Agency to carry the torch for drug free sport in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is as well for me to remind the House of the primary objective of that agency as expressed in its act of parliament. It says that the object of the establishment of the agency, better known by its acronym as ASDA, is to encourage the practice of sport free from the use of drugs in a manner consistent with the objectives of protecting the health of competitors, the values of fair play and competition and, importantly, the rights of those who take part in sport. In furtherance of that objective, ASDA maintains a broad program of sampling and testing both in and out of competition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I take this opportunity to say that the government is fully committed to doing its best to make sport drug free. ASDA, under the capable stewardship of its chief executive, Natalie Howson, has a very good international reputation. But the war against drugs in sport is not a static fight. It is vital that we do what we can to help ASDA stay ahead of the game. I am pleased to inform the House of a review the government has commissioned of ASDA's legislative powers in which we seek 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to make the act under which ASDA operates more flexible. This is timely, given recent concerns about drugs in sport both within and outside Australia and given changes in international anti&hyphen;doping practices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This review, which we hope to complete before the end of the year, is going to make the ASDA Act more flexible and certainly easier to interpret. Possible changes that may be recommended would include such things as the ability of the agency to take action against foreign athletes competing in Australia who test positive for banned substances in cases where the relevant international federation of sport declines to take any action; and the conducting of blood tests for the purposes of health and safety screening. These last two are especially important if developments such as the use of artificial EPO are to be stopped. It will also deal with such matters as the need for further complementary state drug testing legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The review will be conducted independently of ASDA by an external consultant. I take this opportunity to commend my predecessor of this portfolio for starting the ball rolling. He did a wonderful job in that portfolio, and he is going to do a great job in his current portfolio. I look forward to seeing the outcome of the review. I anticipate that legislation may be before the House some time next year.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HQ5">Mr FAHEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased that the honourable member for Lilley has raised this question, because it is a considerable problem and a problem which the community, including government, must address. In fact, the year 2000 computer date problem, or the millennium bug, is a time bomb problem on a massive global scale. If it is uncorrected by 1 January 2000, it will potentially cause massive social and economic disruption. The risk is the loss of continuity of service delivery to government businesses, and the government cannot afford to be complacent with 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that. I assure honourable members that the government is not complacent with that problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The scale of the problem is huge. It affects most computers and software embedded in electronic equipment. I will give some examples. If we have that breakdown, if the problem is not corrected, things that we need in our daily lives, such as traffic lights, hospital equipment, elevators, navigational equipment, banking, taxation and payroll equipment, telecommunications, and emergency services infrastructure will cease to work. It has been estimated that the cost of correcting this problem on a global scale is somewhere between $US200 million and $US300 million.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HQ5">Mr FAHEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry if I said million. I thank the honourable member for correcting me. It will be $US200 billion to $US300 billion if uncorrected. In fact, it is estimated that, if it is not corrected, the litigation post&hyphen;2000 could reach somewhere between $2 trillion and $3 trillion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the government has recognised the problem and has developed a strategy. For correction it requires that there be an inspection, an evaluation, an alteration and a testing of literally millions of lines of computer code. That is complex, time consuming and costly. A requirement has been extended by government to all agencies to report on a quarterly basis between now and the year 2000 on the steps that they are taking to go through all of that to ensure that the problem is arrested and overcome in time. The Office of Government Information Technology has established a project team to assist all the agencies of government to ensure that they are addressing the problem. I assure you that cabinet will keep a monitor on it at all times.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, some $5.43 million has been appropriated to the Department of Industry, Science and Tourism to implement the national year 2000 strategy with the states, and that is to alert all businesses of the difficulty there so that they are aware and take steps. I commend Australian and multinational businesses who have developed management plans in respect of this problem to make sure that there is an allocation of funds to deal with the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9711"> problem in a timely fashion to avoid the disruption that is there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Office of Government Information Technology will also work with the Emergency Management Agency to ensure that plans are in place to ensure that such things as water, gas and electricity are not disrupted in the year 2000. Finally, I would urge all businesses, if they are not aware, to take steps to ensure that they do make some moves in this area, because we want Australia to be by the year 2000 a year 2000 compliant country.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government quite outrageously has tried to accuse the opposition of scaremongering, saying that we are scaring older Australians. Let us have a look at the docu 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment that has been presented to old and infirm people. No wonder you are frightening them. Talk about legalistic gobbledegook! It says on the front page that they strongly recommend that legal advice be obtained in relation to this document before anybody signs it. There are 47 pages of legalese. That is what they have to confront when facing the difficult and horrendous decision of having to go into a nursing home. That is what you are doing to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The really frightening thing that this government is imposing on the elderly is its aged care policy. It has deliberately fudged the story. It does not want older Australians to know the policy. That is why they are so confused. That is why we have had so many people ringing the help line saying, `We can't understand what the government's trying to do.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, when you keep saying to the elderly `may' or `might'&mdash;`You may,' or `You might have to sell your home to get nursing home care,'&mdash;can you not realise that this is not a clear message? That lack of clarity is what is causing confusion, uncertainty and fear, especially when you are dealing with older people in declining health. They are vulnerable people, and you should not play word games with them. You should say, `You will have to sell your home,' or, `You won't have to sell your home.' Come clean with the elderly, Minister, and tell them the truth, which of course is that they will have to sell their homes. Put the $500 million back and then they will not have to sell their homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party has opposed this rotten policy since it was first announced. This government has ignored all of our calls to get rid of it. It has ridden roughshod over the objections of all of the groups that are now coming out to the minister saying, `Get rid of it. Throw it away because it is bad policy.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of the flawed detail of this dishonest and cruel policy has finally emerged to the Australian public&mdash;both to families and to older Australians.

<PARA STYLE="Para">Urgent changes are needed to the aged care legislation, not tinkering at the edges, Minister. We need urgent reform that gets rid of these accommodation bonds and these daily fees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An excellent article about the Council on the Ageing, appearing in the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> earlier this week, called on the government to stop accommodation bonds for nursing homes. For the first time, as they make it very clear in this article, accommodation bonds will be charged for nursing home residents&mdash;those with complex and high nursing needs. That is why we need to heed the words of the Australian Nurses Federation. This week they have resolved to fight the changes in the lead-up to the next federal election. Members were firmly opposed to the government's policy at their national meeting yesterday. They have said that they will leave the poor off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Nurses Federation is currently developing a strategy for ongoing political and industrial action. That is how seriously they are taking it. It is going to involve 110,000 nurses. A total of 110,000 nurses are opposed to your reforms, Minister. They are saying, `This is not the way we want to care for the aged in our community; we want these changes reversed.' They do not agree that there should be up&hyphen;front fees of up to $250,000. They say that the accommodation bonds are unfair and wealth based, as opposed to needs based. Nobody believes that your policy will have anything to do with need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly the nurses who do the caring in nursing homes know that they will be placed, as they say in their press release, in an extremely difficult position. It will be the nurses, Minister, that you will place in the most difficult position of all because those nurses will know who has to go into nursing 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> homes and who is in the greatest need. But will the nurses be overshadowed, Minister, by the nursing home owners?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, there is only one group remaining that supports this policy. It is the nursing home group that Mr Doug Moran belongs to. There is no other group in Australia that represents older people, nursing homes or nurses that supports this policy, not one, only the one that Doug Moran belongs to. Although the Minister for Family Services says that he did not have anything to do with the writing of the policy before the last election, Doug Moran says that he certainly did. He boasts about how much influence he had on the Liberal Party and how much influence he had on the design of this appalling policy that is frightening older Australians.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9716">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this debate at the end of this week is about, of course, is the aged care legislation that was passed earlier in this House and through the Senate. Over the last week there has been a vociferous campaign, led by the Labor Party particularly, against the proposed changes. There are two elements to this piece of legislation. The first relates to what is commonly known as the bonds and the second relates to what is known as the fees which are to start on 1 November which will affect some of the residents in the homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to address the fundamental issue: why is it that we need to have a policy such as the one being put forward at the present time? The fundamental reason is that there is a lack of capital in the nursing home sector. As I have shown before, and I should perhaps finish where I began at the beginning of the week, there is a graph. The graph shows that there was about a 75 per cent reduction in the capital provided to the nursing home sector by Labor during its period of office. That has meant that the capacity for nursing homes, particularly, to provide a level of care that Australians would expect to receive has not been reached.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We took a look at the Gregory report that was provided to the last government in 1994 which indicated there was a crisis in the nursing home sector because of the lack of capital. Both governments were urged to act. The previous government was urged to act and we were urged to act. On coming to government, we established an extensive consultation process. All of those in the industry and consumer groups, and many that you have quoted today, were involved in the process because we took the view that this was a national issue that had to be addressed in a sensible, balanced way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The product of all that consultation was a piece of legislation that was passed here and passed through the Senate with, I might add, the obvious support of the Democrats, then led by the then Senator Kernot. The legislation has stood for some time. Now, on the eve of the implementation of the fees, which is 1 November, we have had this almighty scare campaign that has run around the nation. People should be aware that since 1 October 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the processes of the bond elements of the policy have been in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, one of those that you quote extensively in support of your position is the Catholic Church, and particularly Francis Sullivan, whom I guess we would both admire for his tenacity in arguing his case. In his remarks today I noticed that he is not actually against the bond concept. What he is concerned about, and I can see his point, is that he does not want there to be fee increases. What I have to say to him, and what others have said, is that we cannot go on fully funding every individual that goes into a nursing home without there being some fair contribution to the costs of providing that care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you have a look at the statistics, you see that there are 3,000 nursing homes and hostels in Australia. There are about 135,000 residents. Of that number of people, some 65 per cent are full pensioners. They will not be affected by the fee increase on 1 November. The remaining 35 per cent are split between 10 per cent that are not pensioners at all&mdash;they are fully self&hyphen;funded people and receive no benefit at all; they are affected by the fee increase and they will be judged on their means&mdash;and part&hyphen;pensioners, who also have some income, and they will be judged as to their means on the basic social security test. That will be done through Centrelink. The fee arrangements therefore are impacting on, at best, 35 per cent. But it has been done in a way that is absolutely fair. It is in accord with the broader rules that were put in place by the former Labor government, and it is that test that is causing some concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I have said during question time is that I hear those concerns, I am continuing the consultation process with all of those who were good enough to lend their support to the legislation prior to its passing&mdash;I think nearly everyone, without exception, that the shadow minister quoted from was involved in that process&mdash;and I am asking them to again provide me with further information. I have to say that I am not without advice on this matter. I have been receiving a lot of advice on this matter from all sorts of quarters. I will be doing my very best in the very quickest of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9717"> time to look at the elements of the policy that might need finetuning. We can debate that matter at some future time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it is the fundamentals of the policy that we have to recognise. If this country does not take some of those hard decisions that we know are evident and that have been brought to our attention by the likes of Professor Gregory and others, then I think we are deluding ourselves. The other fundamental issue&mdash;there is the lack of capital that I just talked about&mdash;is the growth in costs and the growth in the numbers that make up the aged population in this country. Nursing home costs grew by 41 per cent and hostel costs by 399 per cent in real terms in the 10 years to 1997, and that demand will increase. That is not an issue that we can ignore. No responsible government can ignore it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The total population of Australia is projected to increase by around 38 per cent between 1991 and 2031 but over that same period the proportion of the population aged over 65 is projected to nearly double&mdash;from 11.2 per cent to just under 20 per cent. By the time I reach 65 there will be double the number of 65&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds in that age group than there are now. That is you and I, Michael. We will be in that group of people who will be thinking about what they are going to do in their retirement and what sort of care they want.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The immediate concern, and this is the point that the shadow minister completely ignores, is the rising proportion of very old people&mdash;those over 80&mdash;who need high level care services. As they leave hospital and go into nursing home care a higher level of care is required. This group of Australians is expected to increase by 49 per cent in the 10 years from 1991 to 2001. That is irrefutable. That is why, on the completion of the legislation, through a detailed negotiation process, organisations such as the Australian Catholic Health Care Association stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With such a massive reform strategy soon to be under way it is now more comforting knowing that the access for financially disadvantaged people to residential aged care services will be improved with the increased subsidies.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In the course of that debate, when the legislation was going through the Senate, we provid 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ed additional support for the disadvantaged to the satisfaction of the Australian Catholic Health Care Association. The Chief Executive Officer of the diocese of Maitland&hyphen;Newcastle Catholic Care for the Aged indicated his strong support in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Newcastle Herald</EMPHASIS>  only yesterday. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It does not seem unreasonable that the frail aged are provided with a higher standard of accommodation and service through a relatively modest levy on the assets they own.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is the fundamental point. Francis Sullivan, also from that organisation, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The challenge for the 1990s is getting a balance between personal responsibility and community contribution.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Community contribution comes from the Commonwealth government. The amount of money that is being provided to the sector for residential care subsidies in this year alone will increase by six per cent on last year and will be $2.695 billion. If you average the increase in the forward estimates to the year 2001&hyphen;02 the figure goes up to $3.2 billion. And the average amount that goes to each of those 135,000 people in nursing homes and hostels coming from the Commonwealth government is about $15,000 regardless of what contribution they make. But even with that amount of money we are not going to be able to satisfy the demand of people wanting to get into residential care facilities. I have a responsibility, as does this government and the opposition, to come up with a policy that can engage all and seek support from all in the sector. And that was done with the Aged Care Bill, which is now an act. They all contributed to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said on my first day on the job here on the Monday when I took over the ministry, I will monitor the implementation process. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and I have had discussions about this matter. We hear the concerns of those who are charged with the implementation process. We hear the concerns of our own constituency and we are going to listen. Of course we are going to listen. But I have to make sure that in doing so I consider all the ramifications of what is proposed by some on the other side. It is not good enough to stand up and say, `Look, we are just going to stop it when we get there. We'll 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9718"> think about how we are going to pay for it when we get there.' That is the very basis of the problem that we have. We cannot turn around and go back.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shadow minister on one of her radio programs was asked the question, `What would happen if you did stop it when you win the next election?'&mdash;heaven forbid that that should happen. In a moment of honesty, she said, `It would be a mess.' Don't the elderly of this country deserve better than that? Don't they deserve a considered, detailed piece of policy thinking about how we deal with this issue rather than taking advantage of the yellers and screamers in the community.</PARA>

Over the last week I have combed through these issues and I admit that there are some areas of implementation that could do with some attention, and I will deal with that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had a question in the House today where someone stood up and said, `Here is a document that goes for 40 pages. How cruel it is to give this to frail people.' That is a classic case of misrepresentation. That was a document prepared by the department and provided to providers, giving all the information that could possibly be given to a potential resident about what they would need to do to enter into a bond and an agreement with you to enter your home. In a lot of those homes those agreements will be very different.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said in question time, you will also have the capacity to ask for assistance, and you are encouraged to do so. We have provided much material. More material will be provided to the community and to all my colleagues in both chambers about how the residential care system works. The integration between the Department of Health and Family Services, the Department of Social Security and the Department of Veterans' Affairs&mdash;my colleague the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) is in the chamber&mdash;is all encapsulated in a little book that people will 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> get over the next several days about the choices that are available to elderly Australians and how you pursue successfully the entry arrangements. They are not designed in any way to stall a positive, long&hyphen;term policy outcome which will give some stability and security to older Australians. To suggest otherwise is the height of irresponsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I notice from the MPI today that there is some attack on the family. As Minister for Family Services not only is aged care my responsibility, so is disabilities, child care, homelessness, youth suicide and the overarching approach to family policy. I cannot think of a policy area that is more central to any far&hyphen;sighted government, and I am delighted to have that opportunity to pursue some activity in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I have to say that the record to date of what this government has delivered to families is indeed impressive: the family tax cuts; the home loan interest rates&mdash;do you know the home loan interest rates are the lowest in 30 years? On the legacy of Labor, I can remember when I was buying my home with my wife. We were looking at interest rates of about 14 or 15 per cent. They are rates that were absolutely untenable. I cannot say that I lamented the departure of Mr Hawke or Mr Keating. They did nothing for my family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am concerned as a young family man about what it is going to be like for my mother and the parents of my friends as they go into nursing homes, because I stand here knowing that we have to upgrade nursing homes. It has to be done fairly and it will be done fairly. I will personally ensure that I will do everything I can to make sure that is the outcome. But we cannot stand the hypocrisy of the opposition saying that they have no responsibility for the neglect. That is why all the industry, regardless of all the different views they have, the competing interests, combined to deal with this particular policy. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) went onto the Ray Martin show and said that he had a vision for Australia where all Australians would feel relaxed and comfortable, there was obviously one group of Australians that he 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9719"> was not really talking about. That, of course, is elderly Australians, especially frail elderly Australians. It is not only those elderly Australians but also, as is mentioned in the wording of this MPI, their families&mdash;their children and their grandchildren. No matter how the Minister for Family Services (Mr Warwick Smith) comes in today, at the end of a very torrid week for him&mdash;and he is quiet and well mannered about this subject&mdash;he knows that there is a problem. He knows that elderly Australians are anxious. He knows that they are looking for answers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the minister was handed the poisoned chalice of this policy area, he perhaps felt that the Prime Minister was not talking about things being relaxed and comfortable for him. The minister was given this difficult policy area perhaps because he gives this visage of butter not melting in his mouth; the type of person who can look at the kids and not give them nightmares. But today he revealed the way that he looks upon those who have been critical. One of his first acts as minister was to adopt the softly, softly approach, to perhaps go to where he could talk directly to elderly Australians who are usually a meek and mild audience. So what did he do? He went onto the Kerri&hyphen;Anne Kennerley show. And today those genuine people who were in that audience and who gave their genuine comments about this area of policy were described by the minister for their efforts as `yellers and screamers'.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It wasn't that Jean McLean. There is a photo that proves it. But 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> I want to quote the Jean McLean who was at that show, who is a retired science teacher. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph </EMPHASIS> says she is 71. This is the message she gave the minister. She said to the minister:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If you are going to continue being a minister, I want you to remember very clearly two things. One, our generation went through the worst depression that history has ever known, then we went into the worst war history has ever known, and after that we had to fight our way up bringing up children and trying to get a home. We have deserved the utter right to some payback by our government.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So, hopefully, while the minister describes these people as `yellers and screamers', he will show the skills that he displayed in his little three&hyphen;year sojourn from this place when he went to Melbourne and had a job as the Telecommunications Ombudsman, someone who was there to listen to people. He might listen to these concerns and he might take them on board. And he might realise that this measure in aged residential care has been taken for one reason and one reason alone by this government&mdash;that is, the budget bottom line. For all the camouflage, for all the talk about the findings of the Gregory report, that is the bottom line. That is the economic rationalist Treasurer (Mr Costello) dictating what this portfolio can spend on this important area. There is only one solution. There is no need for this tinkering, no need for this so&hyphen;called finetuning; replace the $500 million and replace it now. That is the way that we can get on and talk about the true partnership between the community and these people who need the type of care that is provided in nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another one of the furphies we have had in this continuing debate about aged residential care is that in some way the announcement made in last year's budget about nursing homes is an extension of Labor government policy because of the type of policy that Labor had for hostels. We will continue to argue that that is a nonsense. We will continue to argue that that defies recognition of the difference between hostel care and nursing home care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would not usually use Treasury and Finance documents to put a case to assist us 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9720"> in this, but if the economic classicists&mdash;those pure accountants that prepare the budget papers&mdash;can put a case perhaps I can remind the minister of it. In the budget papers tabled by our economic rationalist Treasurer, we look at the classifications in `Outlays'. We are talking about aged persons hostels, and it is described there as the `lower level of personal care'. What heading is that outlay under? That heading is `Social security and welfare'. But I wonder where we find the outlays and the descriptions of what is happening for nursing home subsidies for the aged where, as this budget paper describes, it provides `for the nursing and personal care costs of residents.' At page 4&hyphen;47 it is under the heading No. 5 `Health'. So from the government's own budget papers we have the nonsense that in some way this is simply an extension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will briefly go to another important area concerning the elderly: those people who are the responsibility of the Department of Veterans' Affairs. After two question times, today we finally got an answer of sorts from the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) about the way in which accommodation bonds will affect veterans and war widows. The minister made no apology for the fact that the accommodation bonds will apply to those people. He made no apology; he used it as a debating point for the second day in a row to claim that the people who raise these problems are scaremongering. In 1995, we celebrated Australia Remembers. Perhaps, given the attitude of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs in 1997, we are celebrating Australia Forgets, and that is a damnation of the attitude that this government can display to those people who have served their nation and therefore have always received special compensation because of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to look at some other aspects of the arguments that are being put by the government. It often quotes the Gregory report as the justification for the policy while indicating a description of the state of nursing homes throughout Australia, but it fails to remind the Australian people that the Gregory report, when talking about entry fees as a means of raising the capital, said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . allowing entry contributions seems too harsh a measure.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The other aspect of the arguments that the government has put is that it is the opposition that is causing the anxiety and that it is the opposition that is scaremongering. Again I would like to quote somebody whom I do not usually quote. Neil Mitchell, writing in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Age</EMPHASIS> , said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">And there is another tradition. Critics, again, are "scaremongering". Ask John Howard.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">As Neil Mitchell said, it was of course John Howard's government doing this. This minister, the honourable member for Bass, can be assured of one thing: whilst he is talking about going around listening to people, the Labor candidate for Bass, Michelle O'Byrne, is out there in Launceston speaking to every old person in Bass, hearing how upset and angry they are.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What a diatribe! Who could have believed that people such as the honourable member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) and the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) could come forward with such misinformation, inaccuracy, distortions and untruths. Indeed, I think the honourable member for Jagajaga brought in her notes from one of the earlier matter of public importance debates this week because she simply overlooked the fact that today's MPI was allegedly referring to:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The failure of the Government to protect the interests of Australian families, and particularly the children and grandchildren of the elderly, in introducing its new nursing home requirements.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">She obviously went on the wrong note. One really ought to put some perspective back into this debate. What is the purpose of the changes we have brought in for nursing homes? We aim to bring about a much better and higher quality of care. Most members have 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9721"> been to nursing homes, and most people have seen how very many of our senior citizens live in conditions which are absolutely unacceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did the former government do? It certainly commissioned a report, the Gregory report, which pointed out that much needed to be done, but the former government ran away from the hard decisions. What did we discover upon coming into office? We found that, despite the huffing and puffing of Labor members and despite the hypocrisy that we have heard today, the former Labor government had actually reduced expenditure on nursing homes from $45 million in 1992&hyphen;93 to $10.7 million in 1995&hyphen;1996. And so this government&mdash;again we did not create the problem but we accept the responsibility to fix it&mdash;brought down a policy which was fair, reasonable and equitable and which would ensure that no aged resident of a nursing home would lose more than $13,000 over a period of five years out of an accommodation bond.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When people leave a nursing home, they will get the balance of their bond back&mdash;regardless of what the bond is&mdash;minus the $13,000. It is sad and it is tragic that we find that the Labor Party is playing politics yet again rather than trying to assist the government to implement policy to address 13 years of neglect by the former Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mr Hatton interjecting</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0V5">Mr SLIPPER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Blaxland ought not to interject because his predecessor was the person who came into the parliament year after year making much noise but achieving very little of substance. What we had to do and what we did was to bring in these changes many months ago, and we have received many endorsements from groups throughout the community. The policy is right. In fact, the policy builds on the successful changes to hostel policy brought in by the Labor government in 1988, and it is clear now that the quality of hostels is quite high in Australia. The Labor policy has worked, and we are seeking to build on that policy so that we are able to return nursing homes to a standard which will benefit our senior citizens. One finds also that many 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> people are currently putting family members into nursing homes&mdash;out of hostels&mdash;because of the difference in policy and cost which existed prior to this government being prepared to grasp the nettle.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was also interested to hear the honourable member for Scullin, who spoke a moment ago, refer to Mrs Jean McLean of Glebe. Mrs McLean is an eminent and respected member of the Combined Pensioners and Superannuants Association of New South Wales, an organisation which works in the interests of older people. The honourable member suggested that the minister did not listen and that he was not prepared to look at what was happening nor to take advice. It is interesting that this same Jean McLean wrote a letter to the newspaper. In that letter, she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Smith was most cooperative and listened during the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Midday Show</EMPHASIS>  to ideas which were put to him. I wish him well in his difficult ministry . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mrs McLean recognises that we have an outstanding minister who is prepared to listen and to consult. As he has said over the last week, he is also prepared to look at the policy with a view to finetuning certain minor aspects which ought to be finetuned. But the minister has not apologised for this policy, which is a fair and correct one&mdash;equitable and right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The solution of the shadow minister is that we should simply fund nursing homes from the general community. The shadow minister is simply not taking into account the fact that we have an ageing population. What this government is doing is looking at the future. We appreciate that the percentage of Australians over the age of 65 is growing dramatically. The minister pointed this out in his contribution to this debate. This government is prepared to do something whereas our predecessors simply were not prepared to do anything.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I stated, the actual wording of the MPI suggested that this government is unsympathetic to families and particularly to the children and grandchildren of those going into nursing homes. The minister outlined some of the things that we have done for families. We have of course delivered the billion dollar family tax cut and the lowest home interest 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9722"> rates in 30 years. We have delivered a tax cut of up to $450 for private health insurance and a tax cut on savings of $450 per taxpayer per year. By reducing the number of firearms, we have delivered a safer community. We have created apprenticeships to give jobs to our kids. We have delivered a crackdown on welfare cheats, saving over $1 billion in taxpayers' money. We have newer, fairer workplace relations laws. We have delivered the largest environmental package in Australia's history, we have delivered better literacy skills and we have delivered a better government for all of us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the other hand, what did the Labor Party do? It increased taxes by $10 billion after it had promised not to. It increased home loan interest rates to 17 per cent&mdash;well beyond the 14 per cent that the minister paid when he and his wife bought their home&mdash;forcing many Australian families to lose their homes. The Labor Party&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shadow minister was exceptionally misleading in so far as she claimed that we did not have support for these policies from people other than Mr Moran. I would like to refer to Arthur Brotherhood, the Chief Executive Officer of the National Association of Homes and Private Hospitals Inc. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What the Government is attempting to do is provide the necessary capital from people that can afford to pay to lift the quality of accommodation and care in Australian nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There were a number of editorials which strongly supported the position of the govern

I also want to refer to a front-page story in one of the major newspapers of Australia, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunshine Coast Daily</EMPHASIS> , which publishes in an area I am very proud to represent.

We inherited this situation where the quality of nursing home care to elderly Australians is unacceptable. Consequently, we have brought in a decision which is right. We have not sought to pursue popularity. This decision is not flawed. It is fair and reasonable, and most Australians, I believe, accept that it is equitable for Australians who are able to make a contribution to their nursing home care to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not an attack on the aged; this is a policy which will ensure that Australia's aged people will receive nursing homes of a much higher quality. This policy will put capital into nursing homes with the result that the standards of nursing homes will be such that we would be proud to have our family members resident in them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The simple fact of the matter is that once again the Labor Party has preyed on the fears of our senior citizens. The Labor Party is lacking in vision and principle.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before we finished for question time, I referred to some of the outrageous comments made by the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Adams) and indicated that he was way off the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9726"> mark. The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="r288">Social Security Legislation Amendment (Parenting and Other Measures) Bill</XREF>  we are debating in the chamber today also seeks to amend the Health Insurance Act 1973 from 1 July 1998 so that those children whose parents or guardian no longer qualify for child disability allowance, because of the amendments to the child disability allowance qualification criteria for a disabled child, will maintain their eligibility for a health care card. This will ensure that any child with a milder disability whose parent or guardian does not qualify for child disability allowance because of the changes in eligibility criteria will still be able to get a health care card to cover the cost of pharmaceuticals, treatment, aids and appliances. This obviously is very beneficial for people in that situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, the omnibus bill before the chamber will, from 1 July 1998, change the period over which the income of a health care card claimant is measured from four to eight weeks to lessen the incidence of abuse. Low income health care cards which entitle people to discounted pharmaceutical benefits are issued for up to six months, based on an initial income test. This will lessen the abuse of health care cards by those who are not usually low income earners and will specifically prevent entitlement to health care cards for people whose income is usually too high to qualify but who, after a short period without income&mdash;for example, when they have been stood down over Christmas&mdash;are presently able to qualify under the four&hyphen;week test.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party will no doubt say that this is heartless, but what we aim to do in a situation where we have limited amounts of money for social security and other purposes is to ensure that money gets through to the needy and not to the greedy. We are all about having an appropriate social security safety net. This legislation is about that. The whole ethos of this government is in pursuit of a fair go for disadvantaged Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the Labor Party did, during its 13 years in office, was to turn a blind eye to the fact that millions, probably billions, of dollars were ripped off in social security fraud. The former Labor government suggested there was no problem. They claimed that there might 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have been a few compliance problems but, in other words, no dodgy welfare claims. Labor's social security minister even said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">. . . we have very effective compliance measures and measures to counter fraud.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The minister also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">. . . what we do by way of compliance is now recognised as being of world leading standard in many respects.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Upon coming to government and discovering a $10.3 billion deficit, we had to make sure that the only people receiving welfare entitlements were those who needed them. We have done that, and that is very fair. It is not hurting disadvantaged people. It is not getting stuck into those people who cannot help themselves. We are protecting the community and ensuring that there is an adequate amount of money to pay to people who need to take advantage of the social security safety net.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think people get upset when they know of others who are working and in receipt of income are also receiving the dole. As a result of these cuts in fraud, as a result of routing out those people who were receiving payments to which they were not entitled, we have been able to save $19 million every week. Savings over the next year are expected to be very close to $1,000 million. So much for Labor saying that there was no problem!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A recept report tabled in the parliament by Senator Newman, the Minister for Social Security, showed the following: there were 26,000 suspected welfare cheats; 1,100 people have been convicted of welfare fraud; there have been overpayments of $105 million; and there are 136,000 cases of people being paid too much. We have made a key commitment to cut out welfare cheats. This legislation will put into place a new system of data to cut back further welfare fraud.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the government is sending a very clear message to those people who are rorting the system. They will get caught. It is not a question of if they will get caught but when they will get caught. The government does not apologise for tightening the belt to ensure that only those people who need and who are entitled under the law to receive social security payments receive them.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9727">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation is measured, fair, and reasonable. It seeks to implement budget legislation with one extra measure which is not a budget measure. This legislation is not the sort of legislation referred to by the honourable member for Lyons and by other opposition speakers. This government is all about being fair to those Australians who are disadvantaged. This government is all about making sure that we run the economy properly because, when we run the economy properly, the country will benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor also referred to the Commonwealth dental health service and how that has been cut out. It ought to be recognised that, even when it was set up by the former Labor government, it was intended to be a short-term program to redress current dental health waiting lists. This is a government which has been prepared to take hard decisions. This is a government which, upon coming into office, discovered that there was a budget deficit of $10.3 billion&mdash;Beazley's black hole. We did not create the problem; we were, however, prepared to solve it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whenever members of parliament representing the coalition rise to their feet in the chamber to support legislation which is very necessary for the welfare of this country, we find that those opposite play politics. One of the difficulties about Australia is that we tend to be politics driven rather than policy driven. We tend to have no long-term view, no long-term vision. This is a problem which this government has addressed. We are bringing in policies and legislation which will be to the long-term benefit of Australians.</PARA>

It would be eminently sensible if those opposite were prepared to abandon their pathetic attempt at playing politics. Why are Labor members not prepared to stand up and say that over the last 13 years they made a monumental disaster in governing this country? Why are they not prepared to say they failed? They lost the election. The new government has been put into office with an almost record majority. Why are they not prepared to do that? You are a Labor member, Mr Deputy

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to congratulate the Minister for Social Security on this omnibus legislation. It is much needed and overdue legislation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since coming to power in March 1996, a number of characteristics in regard to the manner in which this Howard government conducts its business and the manner in which the Prime Minister himself does his job have become all too apparent. This is unfortunately not the time or the place to wonder aloud as to which of these characteristics has become the more pronounced as the months have worn on or which characteristic raises its ugly head the most, although I am sure that the non&hyphen;supporters of the present administration will have their own suggestions. They certainly inform my office of them every day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although I will not seek to attribute any rank to these characteristics, I would like to start my speech today by remarking on just a few. Over the last 18 months we have seen the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and his senior colleagues follow a naked, cynical and dangerous habit of choosing to govern according to the politics of division.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So many of this government's decisions&mdash;be they related to education, social security, immigration, health care, industrial relations, justice or Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders&mdash;have been based on playing elements of Australian society against each other: rich and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9728"> poor, black and white, those with a job and those without. Dissent has not been tolerated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Commonwealth agencies and departments, whose role it is&mdash;or should I say `was'&mdash;to question and raise issues with the federal government over its policies, have been attacked with budget cuts, mass public servant sackings and political intimidation. Talk to Philippa Smith, the Commonwealth Ombudsman; talk to Sir Ronald Wilson, the former head of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. From their experiences they will be able to tell you that the Howard government brooks no disagreement with its policies. If you speak up you either get your office's funding cut or your contract of employment is not taken up&mdash;or both.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen a Prime Minister and a government prisoners to the cult of the opinion poll, prisoners to the influence of prime time current affairs hosts and prisoners to the desiccated and shrivelled up views of some of the nation's leading talkback radio figures. As a result, Australians have inherited a caged and creatively bankrupt leadership and Australia has spent the last 18 months casting about for its place in the world and for a sense of its own identity&mdash;casting about and sinking at the same time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we have the manner in which the Howard government has sought to introduce its so&hyphen;called reforms and how it has sought to orchestrate its cuts over the time it has been in office. The practice so far has been to introduce the legislation, often without elements of crucial detail essential to the operation of the policy. Remember the Aged Care Bill, which had no prudential cover and no systems set up which were going to guarantee those funds? The government then announces the cuts, suffers the outrage of peak bodies and interested groups in the short term, and waits six, nine or even 12 months for them to actually kick in. Remember the drip effect of the 1996 budget? This is what they are getting now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After that length of time, those who have been speaking out against the decisions have run their race, long ago, and have all but exhausted themselves&mdash;or so the government wishes. The media turn off to their concerns 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a week after the decision in question is initially made. All that is left is an unassuming public about to get hit straight between the eyes&mdash;and so it goes on, with piece after piece of legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the way it was with the cuts to legal aid. That is the way it was with the cuts to operational subsidies for community based child care&mdash;a bill we had in the House this morning. That is the way it was with the current aged care reforms. That is the way it is going to be with the legislation we are debating in the House today&mdash;the parenting and other measures bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The chief section of the parenting and other measures bill seeks to make changes to the means of qualifying for disability allowances. It is estimated that, via this piece of legislation, over 4,000 families of young disabled children will have their access to the child disability allowance denied. Another 4,500 will lose up to six months arrears of child disability allowance because the arrears are being reduced from 12 months to six months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This will not happen now, in three months time or in six months time but in nine months time&mdash;and this relates to the earlier reference I made to the drip effect of the legislation this coalition keeps bringing into this House&mdash;nine months after the peak disabled groups have run their campaign ragged; nine months after the media has hitched its wagon to another story; nine months during which the Australian public will have remained oblivious to what was sneaking up behind them. That is the way this Howard government plays. It is mean and it is sneaky. The Howard government's record on disability issues has been nothing short of abysmal during the short time it has been in power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The disabled community began to feel concerned almost immediately after 2 March 1996 when the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) started talking about basing health funding, including funding for disability services, on what he coined `competitive federalism'&mdash;remember the words; they really mean that there will be differing standards of health care and services for the disabled from state to state.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9729">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then came the first Howard government budget. We saw devastating cuts to home and community care which have impacted severely on disabled people living alone. We saw cuts to public housing which placed an immediate and significant restriction on general maintenance and repair of public housing, including the housing of those with special needs such as disabled tenants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We saw 30,000 people lose their eligibility for financial assistance for hearing aids and other hearing services as the Howard government made its changes to Australian Hearing Services.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Parents with disabled children, already restricted in their choice when it came to child care, were faced with outrageous fee increases as operational subsidies to community based child care centres were axed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Family and Other Measures) Bill come through this House&mdash;it is presently in the Senate&mdash;which introduced new disability impairment tables. They are a similar concept to the assessment tables this bill seeks to initiate&mdash;to be used to `measure people up' to see if they qualify for their disability support pension. I ask the government how it is going to measure up the disability of a disabled child. In reality this bill will throw hundreds of people off disability support&mdash;disabled people who will have no alternative means of income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there was the government's crackdown on mobility allowance. Under the government's changes, if you are a disabled person who is not in work, looking for work or in vocational education then you no longer qualify to receive mobility allowance&mdash;despite your needs and disability. This has left countless numbers of disabled people wasting away in their homes and unable to use the special transport they need because they no longer receive the necessary financial assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then in July this year we on this side of the parliament watched open&hyphen;mouthed as the former Minister for Family Services, the Minister for the Status of Women (Mrs Moylan), walked petulantly away from an interim 12&hyphen;month disability funding agreement with the states and territories which had 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> already been agreed to in principle in May. The former minister walked away from an agreement which would have delivered certainty to thousands of disabled people across Australia. And they think that disabled people do not know this?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead, they are left waiting until November while funding is dripped out to the states and territories on a month by month basis. And this is what they regard as good government? The fact that the Howard government can act with such cold and unfeeling arrogance while knowing that demand for all of our disabled service types currently outstrips supply is as breathtaking as it is appalling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As it stands at the moment, 13,500 people with severe and profound handicaps are in critical need of accommodation; 7,700 people with severe and profound handicaps have a carer over the age of 70 looking after them; and 7,000 carers of people with severe and profound handicaps do not have access whatsoever to respite care. Yet the former minister and the Howard government saw fit to spit the dummy and turn their back on the situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Victorian Minister for Youth and Community Services, Mr Denis Napthine, said that he was `very, very disillusioned' with the Howard government's attitude as reflected by the then Minister for Family Services. He said, `This creates further uncertainty for people with disabilities and the blame lies clearly with Minister Moylan who has let them down very badly.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The President of the Council on Intellectual Disability, Mr Kevin Stone, said that the outcome of that meeting in July was `reprehensible'. He said that the Howard government lacked a clear policy on disability services funding and the families of disabled people and service providers were `languishing and unable to do any forward planning'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr John Leggoe, the Chairman of ACROD, which is the peak industry body for disability services, said the minister's decision and that of the Howard government was of great concern to people with disabilities and their families who find themselves onlookers to political point-scoring.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9730">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While these negotiations were falling through, those with disabilities, or their families and their organisations representing disabled Australians, were looking on in horror as the Howard government set to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission&mdash;which included as one of its six commissioners one whose sole responsibility was matters relating to the disabled&mdash;with a pair of budgetary shears.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Forty per cent of the funding of what is now called the Human Rights and Responsibilities Commission was cut during the Howard government's first two budgets. In doing so, it drastically cut the organisation's resources and did away with the specialist commissioners, including the Disability Commissioner, further marginalising the needs and rights of people with disabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The disabled community was understandably outraged. The leader of the disability coalition, Mr Ian Irwin, said that people with disabilities daily suffered a form of apartheid and that their only recourse to justice had been the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. He said that they are hamstrung by a lack of resources and intentionally over-extended. He said that the government's transparent hope is that the commission will seldom have the capacity to make too much trouble and that people with disabilities and who are incensed by these developments will just fade away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We come again to this bill, which is, as we can see, the latest in a long chain of insensitive and unreasonable attacks on the disabled within our community. As I stated at the beginning of my speech, 4,000 fewer families with disabled children will qualify under this legislation for child disability allowance. If this bill is passed in its present form, those 4,500 families will lose up to six months arrears on their child disability allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They lose because of the new prescribed list of disabilities and the use of the child disability assessment tool&mdash;essential parts of this piece of legislation which we virtually are being asked to pass here today without even being provided any detail of such a list or how the assessment tool will work. My office has tried every avenue to find out about the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tool they are going to use in this legislation to be able to declare the circumstances with regard to a disabled child.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once again we come to another recurring feature or characteristic of the Howard government&mdash;that is, its willingness to ram legislation through this parliament without providing members with an opportunity to view any of its details. I really do not understand how the backbench on the government side put up with it. It shrouds its unpalatable details with as much secrecy as it can muster and as such prohibits the public from developing a clear picture of how it will eventually affect them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You would think they had learned, but this is exactly the same step this government took when introducing its aged care reforms into the parliament, and look where it has got them eight months down the track. If you think the aged object to the legislation, wait until it gets out to all the disabled kids' mums and dads, aunts and uncles, grandmothers and grandfathers. This is an atrocious piece of legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the detail we have been provided with. The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock), representing the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman)&mdash;I am glad he is now in the chamber&mdash;said in his second reading speech, as brief as it was, that the child disability allowance payment has been seriously compromised over recent years. I think the minister is really referring to the jump in the number of claimants over the past five years. It has risen from 50,000 in 1992 to over 100,000 in 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this minister and the Howard government are really suggesting is that most of these increases have been driven by parents rorting the system. What the minister was really saying was that we have to make these changes contained in this bill because most of these kids are not disabled at all. You tell that to their parents. What you are really saying is that there is nothing wrong with them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So again we find the Howard government playing with the politics of jealousy and division. They are insinuating that people are getting more than they deserve&mdash;more 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9731"> Commonwealth assistance than their children deserve or is necessary. It is a fact that the number of claimants of the child disability allowance has doubled over the past five years. It is a fact that there is no evidence to suggest that this is due to an increased incidence of childhood disabilities in the community. However, there is no evidence to suggest that this growth has been driven by parents simply trying to rort the system. That is what this legislation implies. The real facts behind such a growth have been the publicity campaign carried out by the Department of Social Security, and rightly so, and organisations representing disabled people's interests over those last five years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because of the initiative of both the department and the disabled community, the general public became more aware of the assistance that is available to them than what was available five years ago. There has not been an increase in children with disabilities; there has been an increase of parents with children with disabilities recognising that there is a system out there which offers help and financial assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for the government's assessment tool tables, we should read the bill. The tables attempt to compare a child's disabilities against an accepted developmental milestone put together by the department. After arriving at a view of the child's level of development, the table is then used as a guide when making a decision over how much financial assistance the child should receive. The problem is that neither the Howard government nor the Minister for Social Security have clearly explained the connection between arriving at a view of a child's developmental milestone attainment and a consistent and dependable assessment that the child has or has not met the substantial extra care requirements of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is also pushing for its list of `manifest' disabilities&mdash;those disabilities which are clear to the eye&mdash;covered by the child disability allowance to be revised. This has been met with a large degree of concern among groups representing disabled people's interests. Both the Asthma Foundation and the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation have raised 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> their concerns with the minister. In particular, children under the age of six with diabetes are no longer to be considered as `manifest' cases requiring the relevant level of child disability allowance as is currently the practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We must revisit this bill. We must also take on board the concerns of parents of disabled children. We must sit down and talk to them and realise what these parents go through day in and day out. What we are saying to them is, `Forget it; we don't care as a government.' <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset, I wish to say that I reject the amendment of the shadow minister, the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin). Most members of the House would be sick of her holier than thou attitude about welfare. After her government's negligent mismanagement of the economy, she has very little right to lecture on spending. We have been forced to make some pretty tough decisions because of three words&mdash;Australian Labor Party, or should that be the `Democrat Labor Party'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Listening to the shadow minister, you would think that money grew on trees. That is how Labor acted when in government&mdash;they dished out money like confetti. Who can forget the famous white board affair? Their irresponsibility for all those years is now the burden for this government. We did not create the mess but we are prepared to fix it up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition attack measures we are forced to introduce because of their flagrant abuse of the taxpayer. For the member for Jagajaga to come in here and preach from her pedestal against cutting spending is hypocrisy of the highest order. I pity her family, for if she operated the family budget as she wishes the government to operate, they would be riddled with debt. They would purchase their groceries on credit and rather than pay off the credit card, just keep racking up the debt. That is the way she wishes this government to operate&mdash;the way that the former government operated for so many years, to our detriment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is ironic that the shadow minister's heart bleeds for Australia's youth, yet she wishes to bequeath to them an ever&hyphen;increasing burden of indebtedness. Her second reading amend 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="9732"> ment about an assault on low income earners is just hollow rhetoric. We are targeting benefits to those who need them; we are ensuring that those who do not need benefits are not getting them. That is responsible economic management. `Responsibility' is a word that the member for Jagajaga does not have in her vocabulary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The  Social Security Legislation Amendment (Parenting and Other Measures) Bill 1997  implements a number of changes to social security measures which were announced in the 1997-98 budget. This government has made some progressive and very positive reforms in social security for which it deserves some great credit. Over the 13 years of the former Labor government, we saw develop a reliance on the welfare system. The former government fostered this reliance so that people were indebted to the government. The Labor Party wanted people to be reliant to forfeit their responsibility. They took away responsibilities and told recipients they had never-ending rights, hence this government inherited a massive debt and the process of reform was well and truly overdue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first schedule of this bill makes amendments to the parenting payment. A single parenting payment will be introduced and replace the sole parent pension and parenting allowance. These changes seek to bring simplification to these payments. The sole parent pension was originally introduced as the supporting mothers benefit in 1973. It changed to the sole parent pension in 1977. Payment was made to any person with a dependent child, including single fathers. This was essential to recognise the fact that there are male sole parents. At December 1996, there were 22,971 males receiving the sole parent pension, although that pales in comparison to the 327,000 females receiving the sole parent pension. These numbers give an indication of the number of people who will be affected by this change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The parenting allowance also was introduced under another name. It was previously known as the home child&hyphen;care allowance. The parenting allowance is paid to the parent of a couple at home caring for at least one dependent child of 15 or less. This allowance is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> means tested so that it is, quite rightly, targeted at those on lower incomes. At December 1996, there were some 664,414 recipients of the parenting allowance, of which 632,040 were female. This new payment takes the stigma off single parents. We all hear the innuendoes aimed at sole parent pensioners who are accused of having children to rort the system. Maybe some very small number do but that does not mean that all sole parent pensioners should be tarred with that same brush.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This payment acknowledges the parenting responsibilities of recipients and the added costs associated with having a child. Unfortunately, our society is faced with increasing family breakdown. As one would expect with increased divorce, there has been a rise in the number of recipients of the sole parent pension. In the 11 years since 1986, there has been a 38.8 per cent increase in the number of sole parent pensioners. This, of course, is hardly surprising.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The changes associated with this new payment will bring efficiency to the system by simplifying the administration to making one payment with one set of rules from two payments with two sets of rules. To bring the payment into line from the rules under which they previously operated, there will be changes to the rules applying particularly to those who previously received the sole parent pension. This new payment will also, with the simplification, make the administrative arrangements easier for people who move between lone parent status and partnered status.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important this payment is named to recognise the purpose for which it is provided. It is a parenting payment. It was silly that we had two payments&mdash;one to sole parents and one to partnered parents&mdash;provided for the same purpose. This bill gives recognition to the role of parents and takes the stigma away from the status of the relationship of the parent, which of course impacts on both the parent and the child.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Schedule 2 of this bill amends the qualification provisions for child disability allowance, which is the other matter I wanted to address in speaking on this legislation. In December 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9733"> 1990 there were 42,728 children who were the subject of claims for the child disability allowance. By December 1996 that figure stood at 103,000. During this period there has not been a correlating increase in the incidence of childhood disabilities in the community&mdash;with the exception of asthma and diabetes, although not at the same rate. The coalition's `Health through life' policy announced at the last election is a positive recognition of the benefits of preventive medicine. This will, over time, be for the benefit of children's health and will hopefully assist in containing costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The changes to the child disability allowance are part of a broader carers package. The changes to the CDA are necessary to ensure those deserving of payment are properly targeted. One aspect of these changes which I think is positive is that children of those who are not requiring the CDA under the new rules will be taught to provide for their needs. It will develop their sense of responsibility rather than be reliant on, if you like, the system. There are no doubt various reasons for the increase in the number of recipients of the child disability allowance. Therefore, rather than needing to meet the current criterion of requiring `substantially more care and attention', a child disability tool will be introduced which will measure the impact of a child's disability on their functional ability and communication, mobility, self-care and community living skills matched against development milestones. There will be a list of disabilities and conditions which will excuse children who have such a condition from being assessed against the child disability tool.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These amendments are fair and consistent to ensure that the child disability payment targets those whom it was originally intended to target and does not result in expenditure blow&hyphen;outs from claimants where the disability being claimed for does not require substantially more care and attention than the care those who meet the criteria under the child disability tool would require. Given that there will be a reduced number of children classified as CDA children, those children who lose the CDA would be deprived of a health care 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> card. Schedule 5 deals with amendments to the Health Insurance Act 1973 to ensure that those who would currently qualify for a health care card due to their status as a CDA child will maintain their eligibility for a health care card in view of the fact that the child will still require substantially more care than a child of the same age, whilst not qualifying for the CDA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation is essential legislation. Members opposite have cried their hearts out condemning us for seeking to save the Australian taxpayers' money. Their cheap and nasty attempts to buy votes today by opposing our savings measures would condemn our nation to Third World status in future years. Members opposite have lost the concept of responsibility and seek only to further their opportunism. Australia cannot afford the Australian Labor Party, and Australians will not appreciate the massive tax hikes Labor will be forced to introduce to maintain the inefficient system we inherited from them which they want to continue to burden our nation with. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Parenting and Other Measures) Bill is yet another example of a government governing an economy and forgetting to govern the community as well. Another example of that has in recent times been the nursing home issue. I read an illustration of that on the front page of today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, where a journalist has made a comment. It is in relation to the nursing home situation, but we could almost apply it to this sort of legislation as well. She says:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The policy that looked reasonable on paper just did not add up politically. The sums were fine, but the government failed to assess the social impact.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I wish to apply those comments to the aspects of this bill dealing with the child disability allowance. This government has yet to learn, or I have yet to see the evidence, that you govern for a community and not just the economic side of it. We have another example with this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at some of the detail of this bill. There are many groups in our community who are vulnerable. I do not think any of us in this chamber would disagree on that category. Children with a disability are definitely one of those groups. From 1 July 1998, according to this legislation, eligibility for child disability allowance will be based on a prescribed list of disabilities and a child disability assessment tool.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other aspect is that child disability allowance arrears will be cut from 12 months to six months. What possible advantage can be gained from that latter decision&mdash;that is, cutting the child disability allowance arrear period from 12 months to six months? The only advantage that I can see anybody gaining from that is a dollar saving arrangement. I deplore a government that decides to make a decision based on that sort of mind&hyphen;set.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When a child of any age is showing illness sufficient to require assessment, and to require long-term assessment in some cases, which can unfortunately lead to a decision where the child in question is suffering from a chronic illness, a chronic disease or a chronic disorder of some kind which is going to lead to some form of categorisation as a disability, the time it can take, particularly for a small child, from the point the illness or the symptoms are shown through to the period where a disability can be classified in terms needed for this legislation can be longer than six months. It is not unusual for a small kiddie to have a nagging illness of huge concern grow. At the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> end of that process the unfortunate outcome can be that a disability of some kind is diagnosed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that, with this particular part of the legislation, it is not the first time that this government has tried to shorten that period. On a previous occasion last year there was an attempt to cut it from 12 months to three months. That was rightly defeated in the Senate at the time. I sincerely hope that this particular aspect of this bill is defeated again. I cannot understand the logic and the lack of compassion that is involved in cutting back the arrears period for the payment of a child disability allowance from 12 months to six months, given the difficulties that in some cases occur in relation to the diagnosis of a disability in a small child, particularly the very young. I implore the government to think very carefully.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that some savings are going to be made in this particular area. That is the evidence required to understand the reason for this particular decision. You cannot save money at the risk or cost of small children who are suffering an illness or a disability. You cannot do it&mdash;it is immoral; it is not correct. I plead with the government to think very seriously about the implications. The families of those children have quite enough to contend with. If there is an arrangement made by this community through the parliament for those children to receive a child disability allowance through their families, let them receive it. Do not penalise them for six months of that payment because it may have taken a while for the diagnosis to have been confirmed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is this: the effect of the changes will be to tighten eligibility for the child disability allowance. The government itself has estimated that 4,000 fewer children will qualify for the child disability allowance each year and that the changes will save in the order of $97.5 million between now and 2001. There is the reason for these changes. Compassion, cutting red tape and all of that rhetoric we heard today has got nothing to do with it. It is to do with saving $97.5 million at the cost of those kids.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9735">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that those savings will be crossmatched to increase support for carers. I admire the role of carers in our community and I believe we should do all we can to increase any support possible to them. But how on earth can we do it by cost shifting from children with a disability to carers of ill people? This is just ludicrous. It is something that I find quite appalling. If we were discussing this at a committee, where a lot of logical outcomes can sometimes be reached, I believe that in the climate of a committee we might be able to win the argument. But in this parliament where politics rules hard and fast I have a feeling that this argument will be ignored.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point is that women will again bear the brunt of these cuts&mdash;93 per cent of the recipients of the CDA are women, given their role in mothering care. I will continue to get to my feet, as I do on so many occasions, to remind this government, which boasts and prides itself on being a supporter of women and families, that here is yet another example of where you are flouting the very reputation you are attempting to build. I feel very sad that I have to again describe this as a small&hyphen;minded, mean government. I wish I could say otherwise. I do not believe that a government can be so mean as to want to gain savings by tightening eligibility for child disability allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our families are reaching the point of disbelief at the social policies of this government. Since this government came into power so much has changed. Many families have to spend more on higher child&hyphen;care costs and on prescriptions for themselves and their children when they get sick. They have to spend more on community care services. If they have frail or ageing parents their future care of those parents is now under question given the nursing homes debacle. And, as I have said, affordable child care is now impossible for many families. Our young people are going to face added burdens with the proposed changes under the youth allowance plans and our families are going to bear the weight of those decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those opposite do not understand. If they did they would not be putting these processes 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> up. It is no good trying to work out ways to sell these decisions. Do not go to some marketing expert and say, `How can we make this more palatable?' It is not palatable. You cannot sell it. Do not waste your money. Try to do something internally to change these decisions, I beg you. The situation in relation to the child disability allowance is something that ought to be beyond politics. It ought to be the sort of social consideration that is beyond any dollar saving measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a view from, probably, the position of luxury, as I have never had to try to contend with budget papers and decisions of budgets. I admit that. Not very many people in this place, in reality, have had to make those hard decisions. But I also have a social conscience, and there are certain areas that government is responsible for that I believe should be sacrosanct. There are certain things that you cannot argue are not affordable in this country because of dollar savings, and the distribution of child disability allowance simply must be one of those areas. For $97.5 million, 4,000 families a year miss out. The hardship that they already face is sufficient. I plead with those on the other side: do what you can within your own party to have this appalling decision changed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given more time I would address other areas of the bill. In conclusion, child disability allowance and those who receive it do not deserve this and have done nothing to deserve it. I hope we see a change of heart from the members of the government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening I would like to draw to the attention of the House the very real disadvantage which will be suffered by the constituents in my area, in that part of the district known as Salisbury, from the closure of the Medicare office in Salisbury city centre itself. This decision, which was taken by the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9736"> government something over a year ago now, has just started to filter through into action across Australia, with the government singling out a range of Medicare offices&mdash;nearly 85 Medicare offices across Australia&mdash;to be closed. The Salisbury office, which is currently located in John Street, Salisbury, is to be one of those offices.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Details have been very slow to filter through from this government, which makes it clear that the decision was one which was taken with only the bottom line of the budget in contemplation. They first worked out how much money they wanted to save from the budget in the health area and that one way of doing this could be to close Medicare offices and to cause those people who currently work there to lose their jobs, as well as denying the families in that district the service which the Medicare office has so well provided for several decades now. The only consideration in this government's mind at the time the decision was taken was one of reducing their budget bottom line. It was a cost saving measure only. It was only after they had taken that decision that they started to look at which offices they might want to close in order to fulfil that budget quota, if you like.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Families in the Salisbury area will be significantly disadvantaged by this decision. Not only do Medicare offices make payments of Medicare benefits, of health benefits, arising from GP visits and related medical services; they are also responsible for other payments. The closure will deny people access to an immediate cash rebate. If they are forced to submit those claims by mail, as many older or other disadvantaged people might well be, they have to wait some time for the Health Insurance Commission to process those claims and to post or credit a cheque back to the account of the person concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite clearly, people who have previously enjoyed the convenience and the facility of having that Medicare office in their district immediately to hand now have to travel quite some distance. In some cases that could be five or 10 kilometres, often involving one or two public transport trips. That is a very real inconvenience, particularly to the elderly or 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> infirm&mdash;people who are considerable users of the health care system. And certainly it is a very real disadvantage to a mother with children to care for who now has to make that public transport trip to the Elizabeth city centre in order to use the Medicare office there. Naturally, queues in that office will be somewhat longer as a result of the additional people who will now be using it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a budget bottom line decision from this government which has really disadvantaged the people of that area, and they are very concerned about it. So far, I have received over 350 signatures on a petition which I propose to table in the House, through the clerk's office, next Monday. That is only the start; that is only the initial collection of signatures from the district. People have come forward and have posted those returns to my office. They are very keen to make their protest known to this government and to draw to the government's attention the problems which that bottom line decision has caused them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not the only decision which the government have taken in that area which disadvantages people. They have increased the contribution to pharmaceutical benefits in the case of pensioners and concession card holders by 50c to $3.20. They are proposing other changes to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The new drugs tax, which comes into effect next February, will cause considerable hardship to those who are recipients of concessions and who need drugs from the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The scheme was designed, when it was implemented originally in the early 1950s, as a measure to provide assistance to people who needed lifesaving drugs. The character of the scheme has expanded since that time but it is still very real. The people of my district are severely disadvantaged by that decision and by the many other decisions of this government which have been taken solely from the perspective of the budget bottom line and not from one of caring for people&mdash;caring for people in rural and regional Australia as well as in the suburbs of Australia and the suburbs of Bonython.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Labor Party has recently embarked on one of the most ruthless, arrogant and unprincipled acts of political campaigning in the history Australia. Its attempts to scare elderly Australians, those who have built this country and who rely on their members of parliament to make decisions in the best interests of the nation, can only be described as a cowardly act of political grandstanding at its worst. It is trying to destroy the aged care sector for the sake of a few votes. The very fact that the Aged Care Organisations Association have had to release an impassioned public statement, which my colleague the member for Grey (Mr Wakelin) incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  last night during the adjournment debate, calling for the end to the scare campaign launched by the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) and the Labor leadership attests to the damage that Labor is doing both to the nursing home sector and to the elderly citizens of Australia. What did that organisation have to say about the level of debate coming from those opposite? They said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The politicians are playing games&mdash;and the media joins the fun&mdash;and the frenzy begins!</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Labor Party is playing games with the lives of elderly citizens and those dedicated workers in the nursing home industry. It is playing games while the government seeks solutions to the problems Labor left us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sad to say that this is having an effect on the morale of the nurses and other care givers who work within the nursing home sector. Labor is portraying the nursing homes as greedy, money grabbing and uncaring. The member for Jagajaga is treating these dedicated care workers very poorly, and they will not forget or forgive her. So much for the Labor Party's claim to represent the workers. The nurses are the ones at the coalface and they know that the facilities are inadequate. They are well aware of the need to improve facilities for our elderly.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will. Thank you, Mr Speaker. As a former nurse in aged care, I do know the issues and I can tell all members that what the Labor Party is saying and doing is in direct contravention of the best interests of elderly Australians. The member for Dobell illustrated his complete lack of understanding of the issue yesterday in a question to the Minister for Health and Family Services, Dr Michael Wooldridge. In the question, the member for Dobell asked the minister if elderly nursing home patients might be confused in relation to general medication changes because of changes to the PBS system, further trying to fuel the scare campaign ignited by the member for Jagajaga, who is circling like a vulture scavenging for votes from the families of one of the most vulnerable groups in society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps the member for Dobell does not realise that it is the role of trained and dedicated nurses to care for the medication requirements of residents in nursing homes and to dispense the medication to them&mdash;and they are `residents', not `patients'. Does he not realise that elderly people are in nursing homes so they can receive care that would otherwise be unavailable to them? Does he seriously suggest a resident with dementia or crippled with arthritis or paralysed by a stroke dispenses their own medications? I doubt whether the member for Dobell has ever visited a nursing home. Perhaps, like his former leader, he has flown over one or two on his way overseas.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9738">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Jagajaga, who really is an embarrassment to the Labor Party, has shown her ignorance of the issues throughout this debate. In fact, the member for Jagajaga has shown very little interest in the wellbeing of older people until now. I would suggest that her interest in this debate has more to do with scoring political points and votes at the next election than it does with doing or saying anything constructive in relation to this debate or giving a damn about the hurt, extra work and pressure she is putting on the carers and families of our elderly in nursing homes. She will not allow them to receive nursing care in their twilight years in the peace and dignity that they deserve&mdash;just scares and votes. The fact is that nursing homes need capital upgrading, and Labor left no provision for this. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="9738"><TITLE>Nursing Homes

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, you will not be surprised to learn that I strongly disagree with the remarks that have been made by the member for Makin (Mrs Draper). Perhaps she might, on reflection, think that she has been a bit insulting in the way that she has expressed herself tonight. She might give that some thought between now and next Monday and perhaps give some people an apology when she returns, because I can assure the member for Makin that not only have I been to more than one nursing home but I have been to dozens, not the least being when my grandmother was in a nursing home in my electorate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As recently as last week I was visiting one of the hostels in my electorate, Rosemary Lodge, which does an excellent job of trying to look after several dozen local residents in a situation where no doubt many of them are under a great difficulty. One of the reasons almost 100 people turned up at Rosemary Lodge last week was that many of them have a lot of questions. Many of the residents at Rosemary Lodge and the other hostels in the Bateau Bay area have been inundating my office with questions and queries about how 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the government's new aged care policy will work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did not organise this meeting. The meeting was requested by the residents because they are very confused about the policy which the government has introduced. Bringing in the bonds on 1 October was bad enough, but the confusion that has been caused by the new daily fee that will take effect on 1 November is causing a lot of distress. Several residents have been told that, because the department has not yet assessed their income and assets, they will be charged the full daily rate of $420 a week or more until the department gets around to assessing what the proper daily fee should be. At the very least that should be sufficient justification for the government to at least delay again&mdash;perhaps for the third time&mdash;the date on which that new daily fee will take effect. But tonight I actually came in to speak about the National Health and Medical Research Council.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is rather difficult when you get an insulting speech such as that given by the honourable member for Makin, and I think her ridiculous remarks tonight were worthy of some response.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason I wanted to raise the National Health and Medical Research Council was that it is really quite disturbing to read some of the articles which are now starting to appear. For example, as recently as last Saturday we had an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> under the headline `Despair as NHMRC slips into disarray', and it has a number of quotes from a number of Australians who are very prominent in medical research expressing concerns about delays in the appointment of members of the council, delays in a number of important papers being published and several other issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the reasons we are concerned about the articles is that we believe that ultimately the quality of our national medical research effort does rely on having an organisation which has international stature and is held in very high regard in Australia, and up until now the NHMRC has had that stature and has done a very good job. One of the difficulties is that the current Minister for Health and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9739"> Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) still has not got around to appointing all the members of the various committees. In particular, we do not have the Australian Health Ethics Committee fully appointed  even though the Minister for Health and Family Services has allegedly referred a reference on the use in the past of certain hormones on tall girls to that committee. The committee has not yet been appointed, to the best of my knowledge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also had quite recently the minister deciding to ignore the advice of the National Health and Medical Research Council about funding the use of the new DTPa vaccine, Infanrix, for children to be vaccinated at the ages of two, four and six months. The minister has quite arrogantly claimed that he has certain research which allows him to overrule the National Health and Medical Research Council, and yesterday in this House he refused to even refer the information that he has to hand to the council to allow the council to review that. When the minister claims that this is a fight between two large drug companies, he might actually be telling us the real reason he made the decision not to follow the advice of the National Health and Medical Research Council. I consider that decision to be an absolute disgrace, and at the very least the council should be the umpire which decides these matters. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="9739"><TITLE>Kernot, Mrs Cheryl

Their party would, I presume, describe one of these as one of their leading candidates and the other as one of their leading members. The first is the Australian Labor Party's most recent recruit, Mrs Cheryl Kernot. It is unusual&mdash;in fact, it has made history&mdash;for someone to defect to the Labor Party. The member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) will be the second person to whom I will address my remarks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many people on the Australian Labor Party side of politics these days have&mdash;I think quite rightly&mdash;a very high admiration and regard for the work of the British Prime Minister, Mr Tony Blair. The Australian Labor Party's 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> latest recruit, Cheryl Kernot, has said that she wants Australia to have a vision very much like that of Mr Blair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Blair gave what I can only describe as an outstanding address to the Trade Union Congress in Britain on 9 September 1997. That address contrasts with the address given by the Leader of the Opposition in Australia, Mr Kim Beazley, when, on 2 September, he addressed the ACTU Congress in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">First of all, Mr Blair on 9 September said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have taken prompt action as well to set the public finances right. Our election promises on taxation and spending were not just some short&hyphen;term gimmick to placate the city. The fact is that, if we cannot solve the debt problems that we have inherited&mdash;the national debt doubled in the last six years&mdash;then those at the bottom of the heap will lose out just as much as everyone else.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In contrast, the Leader of the Opposition said to unionists here in Australia:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has been a rude awakening for those who thought this road worth travelling. Even the most conservative economic commentators have now surrendered their positions and conceded that the government's budgetary strategy was wrong and has severely damaged the economy.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In other words, what Mr Beazley said here in Australia was diametrically opposed to what Mr Blair, the British Prime Minister, the hero of Mrs Kernot, told unionists in the United Kingdom. Mr Blair also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We must set in place the minimum standards to deal with the bad employers. What we promised, we will do.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Beazley, in contrast, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AIRC should be able to determine paid rates awards for workers who need them, such as nurses, teachers, firefighters and public servants. It should also be able to approve industry&hyphen;wide agreements like that proposed by the TWU and rejected after Reith's intervention.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">On the subject of flexibility Mr Beazley said, in the same speech here in Australia:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I have said, the only sort of flexibility the Liberals want is the ability to cut wages. They could not care less about giving working people security by helping them adapt to changing demands in the workplace. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9740"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In contrast, Tony Blair, his hero and the hero of Mrs Kernot in particular, told British unionists:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let us not treat flexibility&mdash;in the right sense of the word&mdash;and fairness, as if they were opposites, as if you cannot have flexibility without injustice or fairness without rigidity. We are committed to fairness at work.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Tony Blair went on to say, by the way:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I dream of the day when I come to the Trade Union Congress and the words `labour laws' are not mentioned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Turning now to the member for Jagajaga, I notice in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> that, having had the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) focus his attention on trusts and criticise some members of the government frontbench:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Evans said that one Labor frontbencher&mdash;believed to be Jenny Macklin&mdash;was also the beneficiary of a family trust, but she "is in the process of changing that status at the moment".</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Honourable members should be aware that the member for Jagajaga has an interesting background.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In the past, at least, the member for Jagajaga has described herself as a socialist. At one stage she was coordinator of the Victorian Labour Resource Centre, a socialist left dominated, government subsidised think tank. She was also editor of its journal, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Labour Resourcer</EMPHASIS> .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When she gave the 1983 Marx Centenary Conference Address, Ms Macklin said:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to add some comments to a submission I made to the House earlier this week on the matter of certain clinical trials that were undertaken on both tall and short women in the early 1960s and the efforts those women are now making to have matters and facts pertaining to those clinical trials addressed and released for their own information and satisfaction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I quoted at some length from an <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> article in which Ms Janet Cregan&hyphen;Wood made some comments. I would like to make some further submissions on what Ms Cregan&hyphen;Wood has had to say in other articles, notably those in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> of 17 July 1997, wherein Ms Cregan&hyphen;Wood said that she has no photographs of herself as a teenager. Her mother has burnt all painful reminders of medical science's attempt to make her conform to society's idea of a normal young female. Her part in a trial of the synthetic sex hormone, diethylstilboestrol&mdash;DES&mdash;to stop girls growing tall left her grossly overweight, depressed and with medical problems she fears may have followed her into her adult life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1965, at the age of 11, she began taking daily doses of the drug, after researchers at the University of Melbourne predicted that she would be taller than average. A year later her mother became so concerned at her rapidly increasing weight that she withdrew her. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I wanted to be like everybody else. My mother did it out of love and concern, but I went from being tall and slender to being tall and obese within 12 months. I was told later that I was one of the unlucky ones.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Ms Cregan&hyphen;Wood said her obesity left her with more serious psychological problems than those created by being tall. Her emotional pain was so severe that her mother burnt family photographs of her as a teenager so that she would not be reminded of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Later in life she had to undergo surgery for a ruptured ovarian cyst, one of the potential side effects of DES, and she suffered three miscarriages. Ms Cregan&hyphen;Wood, who is 178 centimetres tall now, wants to know whether her problems and those suffered by other 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9741"> women involved in the trials were linked to the hormone treatment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, there were trials of a not too different nature undertaken in the early 1960s on short girls to make them grow tall, and I alluded to those in a previous speech I made earlier this week. I quote briefly from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> editorial, dated 21 July 1997, wherein it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was a time of too much trust in medical science and too little thought of possible side effects. In the 1950s and `60s, even into the `70s, if you had something wrong, the doctor would give you a remedy. You did not need to be ill to require treatment. You might, if you were female, be too tall or too small or you might not be able to conceive readily. In these cases, some doctors prescribed hormones. But some of the 160 teenage Melbourne girls given hormone treatments from 1959 to the mid 1970s to stunt their growth say the doctors failed to tell them they were part of research conducted by the Royal Children's Hospital and Melbourne University or that there might be side effects.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .       . . .      . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The tall girls, like the small girls, are entitled to an inquiry into the reasons for and possible consequences of their hormone treatment. On the face of it, both groups appear to have a case for compensation for physical or psychological harm they may have suffered.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>  editorial goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We all, as a community, are entitled to be protected from potentially dangerous medical manipulation. To this end, the Commonwealth Government should consider requiring ethics committees to be independent of the hospitals and research institutions they monitor. Sadly, there is probably no such thing as a side-effect&hyphen;free drug.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I will conclude briefly by saying that the women who were the subject of these treatments, both tall and short, are seeking reasonable and legitimate outcomes. What these women, by and large, want is help from the government to contact persons subjected to this experimentation by Victorian registered doctors; they are seeking access to records, including photographic records, so their current health problems can be assessed; and they want proper follow-up research into long&hyphen;term effects of the drugs. They would also like to seek a new system of ownership of medical records for all Australians based on a smart card system.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On many occasions I have spoken in this House on compact discs. But in the last two weeks the federal cabinet has announced that we intend to dismantle the prohibition on the parallel importing of CDs. Given that, the sound recording industry have cranked up their campaign to defend their anti-consumer agenda with deceptive rhetoric camouflaged as economic protectionism.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is it exactly that the sound recording industry want us to protect? Could it be their profits? In the last seven years since the Prices Surveillance Authority handed down its report on compact disc prices, they have made more than $1 billion in profits. Do they want us to protect an industry which only provides Australian music lovers with 20 per cent of the world international music catalogue? Or do they want us to protect an industry which allows them to charge between $3 and $7 extra per CD because of archaic legislation introduced by the Labor Party&mdash;and still supported by the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suspect that their motive for maintaining the status quo is to protect their profit margin. And why wouldn't they? There would be few industries in Australia which are presently so uncompetitive and yet so lucrative. In doing so, ARIA has made the unsubstantiated claim that 55,000 jobs would be destroyed if the prohibition on parallel imports were to be dismantled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, this contradicts the results of other surveys conducted by people within the music industry, the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the Australian Music Retailers Association which indicate that only 3,900 people are employed full&hyphen;time in the music industry. Furthermore, the Chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Com 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="9742"> mission, Professor Alan Fels&mdash;who would be familiar to many people in this House&mdash;has dismissed these claims outright as having no economic foundation. Indeed, there is very strong evidence to suggest that, if the ban were to be listed, as the cabinet has announced, the government's reforms would generate much greater employment prospects because of the stimulation of the industry through increased sales of CDs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In an acknowledgment that CDs are too expensive, the industry claims that a major restructuring of the taxation system is the only way to reduce retail prices. Even if the various taxes on CDs were reduced to zero, Australian retail prices for CDs would still remain significantly higher than those in comparable and competitive markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The effective wholesale sales tax rate on full price CDs is 18 per cent of the wholesale totals, excluding taxes and retail margins. On one of the few occasions that the industry have tried to substantiate their claims, they have claimed that the taxes inflate the figure by 22 per cent&mdash;but they have conveniently included in their calculations figures that should not be there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The figure of 22 per cent does not take account, for example, of the fact that the cover booklet inserted in the CD case is not subject to tax. Furthermore, the industry has not allowed for the fact that the distribution fees payable to record companies by retailers are likewise not subject to tax. When these factors are taken into account, the sales tax rate is actually 18 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In any event, history indicates that the suggestion that a restructured taxation system would reduce the price of CDs is inherently flawed. When in 1985 the sales tax was reduced from 32&half; per cent to 20 per cent, only one of the six multinational recording companies reduced their CD prices. To add insult to injury, over the next 12 months retail prices for Cds consistently increased. Clearly, the taxation system had little influence over the retail price of Cds but a significant influence on increased industry profits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Natasha Stott Despoja, who is from my own state of South Australia, is a self-appointed champion of youth causes, and yet 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> she has abandoned their interests in the case of CDs. She has acknowledged a number of the government's argument with respect to CDs, but she has not committed herself to voting in favour of the government's changes when it comes to the Senate. This is an opportunity for Senator Natasha Stott Despoja to demonstrate not only her concern for young music lovers but also that the Democrats are an independent group apart from the Labor Party, which has been severely tested by the defection of Cheryl Kernot to the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The multinational recording industry have recorded six consecutive wins against the Labor Party from 1990 to 1996, and this year they have lost to the coalition government. They have now turned their attention to the Democrats, and it is to be hoped that the Democrats will stand up for their reputed principles in support of young people and not try to block the legislation when it comes to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sound recording industry have continued to reincarnate fatigued and stale arguments. They themselves are beginning to sound like a broken record.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last night, Mr Deputy Speaker, as you will recall, I drew attention to the corporatisation principles which are attached to the explanatory memorandum of the bills and the amendment makes reference to the Senate Legislation Committee on Finance and Public Administration which considered the provisions of this bill. This Senate committee is chaired by Senator Gibson from Tasmania, who is well versed, as the member for Denison would know, in matters relating to hydro. The majority members of that committee report recommended, I suspect not unexpectedly, that the bills be passed without amendment. There are two minority reports: one by Senators Lundy and Ray from the opposition, and a minority report from the Australian Democrats.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might take the opportunity of referring to page 3 of the Senate committee report which draws attention to those concerns which lay at the basis of the opposition's second reading amendment. At paragraph 8, the report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">8.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The chief concern of witnesses was not so much what the bill contained, but what it omitted.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In paragraph 9 it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">9.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Concern was expressed that the Commonwealth had little input into the water inquiry. The Commonwealth Resources and Energy Minister or his department have liaised over the terms of reference which must be approved by the Commonwealth Minister, but the Minister has no input to the selection of a commissioner to head the inquiry or any say in the findings.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It goes on to say, in paragraph 10:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">10.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Two further concerns were expressed: that the water inquiry should have preceded the parallel Commonwealth/States legislation rather than following it; and that there was no legislated commitment to take into consideration any findings of the water inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In paragraph 11 the reports says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">11.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The committee acknowledges the concerns of the groups who gave evidence to it on the proposed legislation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There are a number of concerned and interested groups who follow, so to speak, the flow of the Snowy. Over the years they have expressed some considerable disquiet and concern about the nature and extent of the Snowy flow. That is reflected adequately in the sorts of newspaper articles and comment that you find if you follow this issue, for example: `Must our Snowy 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9747"> River run dry?' `Snowy flows too low' and `Let the river run free'. That concern as to the adequacy of the management of the river itself lies at the heart or the basis of the amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The detailed committee stage amendment which I will move in the chamber itself when the detail and committee stage is considered will have the effect of not allowing the proclamation of the Commonwealth legislation until the Commonwealth is satisfied as to the adequacy of the inquiry, the conduct of the inquiry, the outcome and, most importantly, the implementation of its findings. That is reflected in the reference I made to the Senate report where there is a reference to one of the parties who gave evidence that the Commonwealth has no say. As I have put it, the Snowy is a national icon. There ought to be a substantive Commonwealth national policy interest and there are national policy issues to be considered here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the things which the water inquiry needs to focus on, and I am sure will focus on, include the views of all interested parties&mdash;irrigators, environment interests and other downstream users of the water; the financial consequences of changed allocations, if any; and the nature and extent of those changed allocations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor senators, in the minority report, had in their recommendation a suggestion which is not dissimilar to the detailed committee stage amendment which I will move. Mr Deputy Speaker, I have some considerable time left but I think I have covered the issues in the nature of the debate in this chamber. I am quite happy to formally now move the amendment that has been circulated in my name.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate, to reflect on the amendment moved by the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) and on the motives behind that amendment, and to make a comment or two about my involvement both as a South Australian dependent on the waters of the Snowy and as an irrigator concerned about the quality of the water that flows through the Murray&hyphen;Darling Basin system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment moved by the member for Perth reflects what are understandable community concerns. But they are also largely unfounded community concerns. It is a bit of a case, in this instance, of the opposition wanting both to have its cake and eat it too. To quote from the member for Perth's participation in this debate a few minutes ago, he said that much of the enthusiasm for his amendment came from those who sought simply, in his words, to `let the river run free'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the sort of emotive sentiment that is largely embraced by a range of people participating in this debate. It is the sort of emotive sentiment with which I could easily be identified because I, too, would like to stand and watch all rivers run free, unhampered as it were by the activities of people who have chosen, for one reason or another, to restrict various rivers' flow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point about this legislation and the point about the amendment moved by the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) is that this legislation seeks to do what is environmentally responsible. This legislation seeks to ensure that the diverted waters of the Snowy are used for the most effective power generation possible. The member for Perth and, I suspect, those from the opposition who will follow him in proposing this amendment to the legislation, are, as I said in my opening remarks, seeking simply to have their cake and eat it too and to make all of the noises about being green but not accept the responsibility of taking difficult decisions in order to ensure that the green nature and the environmental sensitivity of the Snowy, and those rivers dependent on it, are preserved.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9748">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The situation simply is this: as a nation we are now largely dependent on the diverted waters of the Snowy scheme for efficient power generation. There is probably no other place in Australia, not even in the home state of Tasmania of the member for Denison (Mr Kerr), in which power is as efficiently generated as it is in the Snowy. I would be happy, by the way, to withdraw that if the member for Denison could give me evidence but I am sure he and I would mutually agree that hydro-electricity represents a very renewable form of energy that all Australians welcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is easy to move glib resolutions and amendments about what ought to be done without recognising the simple truth that we have become dependent on the Snowy scheme for the efficient generation of electricity. Making more water available for other purposes will be, in one degree or another, at the expense of the efficient generation of electricity out of the Snowy River hydro scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Every Australian is proud of the Snowy River diversion; every Australian is proud of this massive capital expenditure which diverted water from the Snowy and sent it west through a myriad of tunnels and aqueducts so that power was being generated as the water fell and that, simultaneously, additional water was available through the Murray and Murrumbidgee irrigation areas to flow ultimately into South Australia to the advantage of South Australians and to electorates such as mine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Electricity generation and demand for power is rising, I am told, at the rate of approximately five per cent per year. Most industries in Australia have an electricity power input cost ranging somewhere between five and 30 per cent. The efficient&mdash;and by the word `efficient' I do not mean solely economically efficient, I mean also environmentally efficient&mdash;generation of power is very important. It is very important to the nation, particularly in light of the present debate which is raging globally about the greenhouse effect and our responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the bill before the House, what is proposed is the corporatisation of the Snowy Mountains authority and the legislation currently being considered by the Commonwealth is to complement legislation that has already passed the parliaments of New South Wales and Victoria. It was delayed in order to allow it to pass those state governments and then be complemented by the legislation we are considering.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This corporatisation runs counter to many of the policies pursued by the opposition and is an area in which there is a distinct policy difference between the opposition and the government. The government does not fear corporatisation. It recognises that ultimately the market will dominate the decisions we make. We may not like that and we may want to cushion some of those decisions in order to ensure that people who are disadvantaged are not going to be bruised by the dominance of the market but, ultimately, whether we like it or not, the market will dominate and all we can do is offer some cushioning for those who, as I said, may otherwise find themselves economically disadvantaged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of the market for power generation, we need to ensure that power is being generated in the most efficient way possible in Australia to meet the long&hyphen;term obligations we have to reduce the adverse effect of emissions that would increase the greenhouse effect. This legislation frankly allows room for the competition policy embraced by both sides of the parliament to be implemented in the area of power generation. What we are considering is the corporatisation of the Snowy scheme to allow competition policy to dominate the way in which power is generated and distributed across this nation.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9749">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much of the concern about corporatisation expressed by the opposition is a concern I understand as a South Australian. Opposition parties in South Australia have expressed exactly the same concern. They expressed it about what was happening to the distribution of water, not power, in South Australia and the proposal by the South Australian government to corporatise the water distribution system within that state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Wrongly, the image was created that South Australia's water distribution system was being corporatised simply to allow it to distribute profits at the expense of the users. The reality is that the corporatisation of water in South Australia has resulted in much more efficient water delivery. An asset owned by the people has not been sold&mdash;I must emphasise that point&mdash;but the capacity to distribute that facility has been corporatised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I digress very briefly to use an appropriate illustration in the case of the corporatisation of water. It is like saying that the ownership of the pipes that bring the water to the shower still remains exactly where it was, but the taps are switched on and off by a corporate rather than a public identity, so the delivery of water is determined by those who efficiently manage those two taps.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of this electricity distribution, what is proposed by the New South Wales, Victorian and Commonwealth governments&mdash;governments of both political persuasions&mdash;is the corporatisation of the Snowy Mountains power authority to ensure that the way the power is generated and the water is directed is done as efficiently as possible and that the management is under a corporate rather than a public authority. The major shareholders in this new corporate company will be New South Wales, Victoria and the Commonwealth. It is proposed, because of the location of the Snowy Mountains Authority, that the new company be incorporated in New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn to where I began. I understand the superficial concerns expressed by the opposition and reflected in the amendment, but the simple view that in some way we can return the Snowy to its pristine state is nonsense. We are dependent on this river for the most efficient power generation in mainland Australia. Its management has never been better. The bill before the House allows that management to be sharpened even further through corporatisation. The management currently ensures not only that power is efficiently delivered but that water makes its way into the western states of Australia, particularly South Australia, and makes it way for uses in irrigation and South Australian industries, after that water has generated the power that eastern Australia so desperately needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill is about the efficient generation of that power and the fact that this national resource, having been used renewably to generate that power, then makes it way to my own state for irrigation distribution and for use as an irrigation supply. The irony is that we look at the efficient generation of power through this water system and fail to recognise that in the process we have also enhanced the environment of South Australia in water terms as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The irrigation areas of the Murrumbidgee represented here by the member for Riverina (Mr Hicks) and the irrigation areas of South Australia represented by me are largely dependent on Snowy water in order to ensure environmental flows into both the Murrumbidgee and the Riverland. Those additional flows have ensured that the water that is available to irrigators and domestic consumers is of better quality because of the management by the Snowy authority. This legislation ensures that both the water environment and the power environment will be more efficient.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9750">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a matter that I did overlook and that is that while the legislation has passed the lower house in New South Wales, it has not passed the upper chamber. I was conscious of that but did not emphasise it in my speech. However, the significant thing from my point of view is that here we have legislation for the efficient generation of power and effective environmental flows through both the Murrumbidgee and Riverland areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those environmental flows determine how efficiently we can irrigate and it is, for me, a two-edged sword. This legislation allows us both to efficiently generate power and efficiently provide quality water into the electorates of the member for Riverina and myself. For that reason I support this legislation which complements what has already happened, or is happening, in New South Wales and Victoria.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I will take advantage of your invitation. This legislation, the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R267">Snowy Hydro Corporatisation Bill 1997</XREF>  and the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R268">Snowy Hydro Corporatisation (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1997</XREF> , is important legislation. The principle of corporatisation of the Snowy Mountains Authority is not one with which the opposition has any difficulty. However, we do have a significant concern about the way in which the water resources of the Snowy scheme are allocated. I suspect it is a concern that is shared by government members because the bill proposes a mechanism where there will be an inquiry into appropriate allocations of the various flows that are necessary to sustain various users of those water flows.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The concerns that are no doubt common to landowners who require water for irrigation in various places are certainly going to be taken into account in a future inquiry, and the government has acknowledged that environmental flow is a significant issue that should be taken into account. However, the problem with this bill is that it takes a shoot first, ask questions afterwards approach. In other words, once we pass this bill the Commonwealth parliament effectively renounces any responsibility for what occurs thereafter. It plays no part in the appointment of the inquiry, it plays no part in assessing the validity of any conclusions reached by that inquiry, and it has no mechanism to intervene to ensure that national priorities are actually achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part of the national priorities that we believe this parliament must express is to ensure the environmental flows of the Snowy River itself. It has been said, and I think quite correctly, that the Snowy River is a national icon. I do not think there is any schoolchild in Australia who has not at one stage heard, if not to learned, the words of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Man from Snowy River</EMPHASIS>. As well as that poem which has captured the imagination of generations of Australians, most people see the Snowy Mountains as an area of significant environmental importance and part of our national heritage. The idea that the river may be reduced to a trickle, and significant environmental impacts flow from that, is not one that Australians would entertain with any support at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not saying that the process is wrong. We are not saying that it is wrong to corporatise the authority which manages those water flows. We are not saying it is wrong to have an inquiry. We are saying it is wrong for the Commonwealth to step aside from any responsibility in the passage of this legislation before that inquiry reports and until we have a chance to see whether that inquiry has found in a way that we would support.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9751">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no necessary reason to be troubled by the fact that the inquiry is to be established by the states rather than by the Commonwealth, but it is not unknown for inquiries to go off the rails. It is not appropriate for this Commonwealth to discharge its national responsibilities by saying that we will simply invest our faith in an inquiry of which we will not be involved in the form, the processes and the management, and which will not be responsible to the Commonwealth in any way, and of which the outcome is entirely unknown at this stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are simply saying, `Let's hold the horses on this one; don't let them bolt down the ravine and crash down there with the sparks flying, until we know whether or not the inquiry does produce a result that we are comfortable with.' It probably will, and what is to be lost by insisting on that? A tragedy would be&mdash;and I think this government would find itself in a humiliating and awkward position&mdash;if as a result of an inquiry a perverse outcome is had and we are stuck with the situation where we have passed this legislation and yet the majority of the federal parliament, with national responsibilities, would be powerless to do anything about it. That would be a very poor outcome and not one that this opposition is going to be complicit in, in any way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have moved amendments which are simple in their intent. They do not really conflict with the objectives that the government is expressing. It is not the case that we have, as honourable members from the government side have been saying, a naive appreciation of this issue. It is not the case that we are suggesting that the Snowy River can run unbounded, as once it did before human intervention. But it is the case that we know that human intervention has had damaging environmental effects and that those damaging environmental effects have caused real community concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We want to make certain that we retain a role for the Commonwealth parliament so that we can look at the results of any inquiry. Included in the matters that the inquiry must take into account, as well as the distribution between various farm irrigators and other users of the water for commercial purposes, is that we want to make certain that the environment is not put at further risk and that we can do something to ensure that future generations of Australians are not left with a ditch through which a trickle runs: an environmentally degraded Snowy River.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The point is a simple one. It is puzzling that the government is standing on its dignity in relation to this matter. It would seem to me a convenience for the national parliament were we able to find an agreement that simply said that the corporatisation process was not one in which there was any political disagreement or any significant disagreement that there are competing and legitimate calls on the resources of the Snowy scheme. It is a river which has been dammed now for many years, over several generations. Invested in that were great engineering effort and tremendous national pride. We are not suggesting that that was wrong. Modern approaches might not go down that course but, at the time, it was an approach which was the source of great national pride and, as a result, many people have their livelihoods dependent on the diversion of some of those waters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not suggesting that those issues should be ignored. We are saying that, at the end of this process, the inquiry may report in such a way that the commercial interests of a significant group of people who are dependent on that river may be placed at risk, or that, importantly&mdash;and I say this from my role as shadow minister for the environment&mdash;the environment and the flow of the Snowy itself are jeopardised in a way which the Australian community would regard as both unjustifiable and requiring the intervention of the Commonwealth parliament. If we pass this legislation, we will have basically handed away 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9752"> any reserve capacity to act on behalf of those who have a concern for the preservation of this river system, which we all hold to be so important as part of our natural heritage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should not be acting in this way. The suggestion that the Commonwealth parliament would dispose of its responsibilities in key areas, by passing them to an independent inquirer and then saying, `We wash our hands of any responsibility,' has never been a course that has been commended to the parliament. We normally resist those things; we should resist them now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It certainly would be a great comfort to those Australians who believe that we ought to be able to protect future generations and ensure the viability of the Snowy River system that we do not set out on this course without the capacity of this parliament to later review any finding that, by some mischance, happens to give insufficient attention to those matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a proposal that has been moved by my colleague as shadow minister for resources and energy and one which we would hope would find support from the government. It does not conflict with their objectives, unless they are seeking to hide some base motive, and I do not attribute that to them in the least degree. I think we do share a common objective in this area, but that common objective could be derailed unless the Commonwealth parliament does retain that residual responsibility. To pass that up would be something that the Australian community will blame us for and hold us responsible for if we pursue a process where we wash our hands of responsibilities without knowing what the consequences are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bible</EMPHASIS> leaves the greatest stain on those who take such courses&mdash;Pontius Pilate is remembered as the one who washed his hands. We have popular sayings of people who behave foolishly without knowing the consequences of their actions. We call it `buying pigs in pokes'. We talk about `shoot first; ask questions afterwards'. We have a whole range of expressions that sum up the wrong&hyphen;headedness of addressing an issue by establishing a process over which we have no control and then allowing the matter to go out of our hands and our judgment, and abdicating our national responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The mechanism in this bill is not one which we would support, although we support the objectives. We certainly would like to see this parliament maintain the responsibility that it should have for the future generations of all Australians.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak in this debate in support of the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R267">Snowy Hydro Corporatisation Bill 1997</XREF>  and the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R268">Snowy Hydro Corporatisation (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1997</XREF> . It will afford me the opportunity to make some comments about the scheme and the major engineering achievement that it was, and then to discuss further what I think this country needs to get it moving economically, that is, to look at major capital works programs of a similar nature to the Snowy Mountains scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The scheme itself was a major engineering achievement. It was far&hyphen;sighted, imaginative and innovative. I dare say it was one of the springboards to growth and prosperity in the fifties and sixties. It generated confidence, it generated jobs, it generated work for migrants who came to this country from all countries of the world, particularly from Europe, and it gave to this country a cultural identity which was enhanced enormously as a result of the migration of many of those people from foreign lands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those people, who were then called the `new Australians', have now become, with their children, part of the great Australian tradition of accepting people from overseas who have come here and worked damned hard to build Australia and make Australia great. That scheme 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9753"> itself is an absolute testament to the many migrant workers, as well as many Australians, who worked on it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The genesis of the scheme derived from many proposals and suggestions during the first half of the 20th century. It culminated in definitive plans after World War II, and the Chifley government established the Snowy Mountains Hydro&hyphen;electric Authority. The constitutional validity for the establishment of such an authority was the exercise of the defence power at that time. Over the years, some doubt about that crept in and, ultimately, there needed to be joint Commonwealth&hyphen;state legislation which culminated in the Snowy Mountains Hydro&hyphen;electric Agreement Act 1958.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The scheme itself took 25 years to construct. It was one of the largest integrated water resource developments in the world, encompassing 16 major dams, seven power stations, 145 kilometres of interconnected tunnels and 80 kilometres of aqueducts. It is interesting to look at some other figures relating to the scheme: the scheme diverts the water of the Snowy River and its tributaries, which flow to the sea near Orbost in eastern Victoria, westward underneath the Snowy Mountains to augment the natural flows of the Murray River and the Tumut, which is a tributary of the Murrumbidgee River. It makes use of a total difference in altitude of some 800 metres between the main reservoirs and the power stations to the west.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was interesting to hear the Chief Government Whip, the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew), talking about the effects it produced on his electorate. It is quite extraordinary that here is a development, which is in the seat of the honourable member for Eden&hyphen;Monaro (Mr Nairn) and almost down the road from the parliament, yet we have the Chief Government Whip saying that that has an effect in his electorate and also on the electorate of the member for Riverina (Mr Hicks). It is quite an amazing thing to contemplate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it did not stop there. In my view, the scheme had an effect across the whole of the country. As I have indicated, the scheme plays an important role in agricultural production, river management, flood mitigation, flood flow augmentation during drought and the control of salinity in the Murray and Murrumbidgee Rivers. Water has been diverted from other rivers such as the Snowy River. The community has started to question whether development of the Snowy scheme adequately acknowledged the impact of reduced flows in other rivers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the broader level, the Council of Australian Governments agreed to a process for water industry reform in Australia at its meeting on 11 April 1995. The comments of the member for Denison (Mr Kerr) about some of the aspects of the scheme looked at through 1997 eyes are probably fair. The development at that time was one that was certainly a great boost to Australia and one that was readily agreed to by all sides of politics. But it is true to say that there are some aspects on the environmental side of things that also have to be considered. With the benefit of time and with hindsight, it is obvious that some adjustments need to be made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nonetheless, what a fantastic scheme it is when you think of the enormity of the scheme with 25 years involved in completing it. When you think of the 100,000 people who were employed in the construction, they included tradesmen, labourers, engineers, draftsmen, drivers, fitters and turners, boilermakers, welders and people on the civil engineering side&mdash;all of those people were associated with it. It is an enormous thing to contemplate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there were the support mechanisms that go with that employment such as the local businesses. But it spread even wider because there were little engineering shops, many miles away from the scheme itself, which turned up parts on their lathes, made tanks, welded boilers 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9754"> and constructed the turbine itself&mdash;all of those sorts of things. I am not sure that there were boilers there since it is hydro&hyphen;electric, but there were so many different aspects to it that the spread and the trickle&hyphen;down effect were quite incredible. Indeed, one can descend into metaphors here by thinking of the flow&mdash;metaphorically&mdash;the confidence that was generated by those turbines turning and the prosperity that was engendered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had, of course, in Queensland, suggestions made over the years about the Bradfield scheme, a scheme that has never really got off the ground although it has been talked about for a long time. It involves a similar turning around of water back into inland Queensland&mdash;a major project when one sees in North Queensland so much water running into the sea.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SK6">Mr TONY SMITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We need the determination to look at these things and make them happen. The member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) has anticipated where I am travelling with this. It is those sorts of schemes that we have to look at, not only to stop this incredible drought cycle that we have all the time, but also to look at the confidence that can come with major capital works programs like this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am aware that the government will establish the Australian Federation Fund of $1 billion, but is this really enough in the great scheme of things? We have a major unemployment problem in my own electorate, particularly amongst youth. That occurs in a number of electorates, I know. It is a major problem for all members to grapple with and for governments to grapple with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government must seriously consider projects of a major scale that are open and that can stay with this country for many years. They can be part of the landscape and part of the revitalisation of Australia to remove the scourge of youth unemployment, and that of older people who are unemployed, by getting those people working in various occupations on the big projects that are there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard talk by Everald Compton about a Melbourne to Darwin railway. Things like this need to be discussed and looked at at this time. I am very much aware of the proposal for the employment of 100,000 people through a government scheme similar to the construction of the transcontinental railway from 1913 to 1917. There have been proposals about this and I think it is worthy to look at them, not dismiss them out of hand, because we do have a very serious situation in this country. Capital works did do the job for us, in my view, in the 1950s and 1960s when we had a time of great prosperity in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems that virtually since the mid&hyphen;1970s this country really has not gone ahead to the extent it should have. There have been a lot of changes. There has been a technological revolution in so many areas. But still there are problems on the land with drought, with the attendant problems of unemployment and unskilled labourers who have nothing to do in so many areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With a project of the major capital type, perhaps we can do something about that. The suggestion of how it would work is something like this: the work would involve the provision of infrastructure throughout the country, meaning structures necessary for our everyday living and for increasing our population, including the basic supply of public facilities such as highways, bridges, streets, airports, water support, sewerage, electricity, et cetera.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apart from 100,000 jobs, finance would flow to the Treasury. There would be a marked influence on business as well. The 100,000 people being unemployed costs the government 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9755"> $1.5 billion a year in unemployment payments. If all of these people were employed they would contribute $600 million in income tax, giving a net profit to the government of about $2 billion. In addition, the extra income from the 100,000 workers of about $700 million per annum would create a much greater demand for goods and services. As well, the larger projects would need support industries. In the long term there would be no shortage of available infrastructure to facilitate further national development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the time available it is not easy to go through these individual costings, but I will give an example. PAYE tax paid on an average of $28,000 is $6,000 per annum, leaving aside rebates and deductions. The net income of the employee would be $22,000 per annum. This compares with $15,000 presently paid to unemployed married workers. The estimated cost of employment of each worker would be generously calculated at: wage, $28,000; on&hyphen;cost, at 40 per cent, $11,200; and plant and material cost, at 20 per cent, $5,600&mdash;a total of $44,800 or, in round figures, $50,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At that rate the total annual cost of employing 100,000 workers would be $5 billion. Total borrowings over a 10&hyphen;year period would be $50 billion plus interest at one per cent. A 20&hyphen;year cost recovery period at five per cent per annum, which, in the case of each separate project, would begin on its transfer to the other contracting party&mdash;municipality, irrigation or road&hyphen;rail authority, state or federal department&mdash;would require an annual repayment of approximately $2.8 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These figures are calculated within broad parameters, but it is important to note the effects of all of this. The absorption of 100,000 workers, mainly married breadwinners, into active employment of this type would relieve the federal budget of an unemployment expenditure of between $1 billion and $1&half; billion per annum. As to the tax paid, as I mentioned before, 100,000 workers paying that average tax would contribute $600 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purposes of the plan are confined to the necessity of making a direct attack on the unemployment problem. They do not remove the need to deal with the repayment of the foreign debt. The total extra income of 100,000 workers would thus amount to $700 million a year, resulting in a modest change from the present inflationary policy and thus providing a foundation of expanded demand for the products of both new and existing businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to consider proposals like this. The Snowy Mountains scheme would never have got off the ground but for far&hyphen;sighted and innovative policies and people of goodwill who saw the need both to increase Australia's population&mdash;to uplift its skill levels with skilled migrants and others who came to this country during the late 1940s, 1950s and 1960s to help augment the work force&mdash;and to look at the need that we have in this country to stabilise the drought cycle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do have to look at major capital works, in my view, to end this terrible drought&hyphen;wet cycle which is becoming more and more drought&hyphen;drought&hyphen;drought and very small wet. But if the water is being lost, as it has been over many years, and we have got the technology and the engineering expertise to change it, we have got to start looking seriously at these things. Unless we do that, we in this country will be selling out our young people, who, instead of being entitled to a future, will be bequeathed a debt. I support this legislation, but I ask the government to look at the building of major capital works in the years ahead and provide a vision for this country.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is my pleasure to speak on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R267">Snowy Hydro Corporatisation Bill 1997</XREF>  and the  <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R268">Snowy Hydro Corporatisation (Consequential Amendments) 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9756"> Bill 1997</XREF> . As the member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith) commented, the Snowy scheme is very much within the electorate of Eden&hyphen;Monaro. It is predominantly within the electorate of Eden&hyphen;Monaro, although it has impact on a very large part of Australia, covering three states and a territory, the ACT.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The scheme is certainly one of the great engineering feats of this century. Many people would say today that, given some of the projects which have had great difficulty getting going in recent years, one may wonder whether, if the Snowy were being envisaged today, it would get off the ground. The vision that was shown by governments of the day to get it moving, back in the 1940s, was quite something.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Besides the terrific scheme and the impact that it has had on irrigation and power generation, the other thing about the Snowy scheme during its construction phase is that it has also had an enormous impact on Australia and on a variety of industries and professions. Cooma, in my electorate, is today probably one of the most multicultural towns in Australia. This is very much a result of the Snowy scheme and the people who were brought from all over the world because of their expertise in a variety of areas. Many of those people ended up back in Cooma. There are already several generations of those  people. Cooma is a great example of a variety of backgrounds coming together and living in terrific harmony. In the year 1999, we will have the opportunity to celebrate that Snowy scheme. It started in 1949 and it will be 50 years old. Certainly one of the focuses of this celebration will be on that multicultural aspect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation comes about for the corporatisation of the Snowy. This is something that is really required for it to compete in a very rapidly changing electricity market, and I support that move wholeheartedly. If the Snowy scheme is to survive the long&hyphen;term future, this step has to be made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The make-up of the Snowy is an interesting one. It is one that a lot of people do not understand in that it is the responsibility of three separate governments. The ownership involvement from the three separate governments is also often misunderstood or not known. It is described in the way the equity will be in the Snowy Hydro at the completion of the corporatisation&mdash;and that is, 13 per cent to the Commonwealth, 29 per cent to Victoria and 58 per cent to New South Wales. New South Wales has the greater part of the ownership of the ultimate corporatised body. Victoria has the second largest, with the Commonwealth only having 13 per cent. But the Commonwealth has the greater part of the debt and it is of great interest to the Commonwealth to move through this process for that reason as well as many other reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the completion of the corporatisation, the Snowy Hydro will assume the debt, which will be equivalent to the market value of the current agreed debt with the Commonwealth. So there is a negotiable amount there which the Commonwealth will have to agree to, as to the debt that the new entity will take over. They will take it over on the basis of an interim loan which will be for a term of six months. They will have six months to sort out their finances and ultimately repay that loan to the Commonwealth as soon as practical. That is what is in place in this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing which is a matter of great debate is the issue of the water. One thing that needs to be understood is that the water will not be owned by the corporatised body. Some people have misunderstood that; they thought the actual water in the scheme will be owned by Snowy Hydro. That will not be the case. It will not be an asset of Snowy Hydro. There 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9757"> will be a licence with the New South Wales government for that water and that licence will be for an initial term of 75 years with a 50-year renewal option.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some people have been concerned about that as well, that that term is too long and that it does not give safeguards. But the New South Wales legislation will add some safeguards with respect to that water licence. I understand that that legislation will have in it a requirement for frequent analysis and review of that licence, in particular in relation to environmental flows.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we come to the issue of environmental flows, which is probably the one contentious issue in this whole procedure. Going back quite some months before this legislation was put together, I think it was the view of the New South Wales government, the Victorian government and the Commonwealth that the corporatisation should proceed but there should be a mechanism, once the body was corporatised, to then go through a water inquiry process to see what changes should be made to the various flows.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I certainly made very strong representations to the Minister for Resources and Energy (Senator Parer) in relation to this, following many discussions I have had with people throughout my electorate particularly affected by the Snowy River itself. I was very pleased that the minister understood this problem and, in consultation with the New South Wales and Victorian governments, it was decided that a water inquiry will be conducted prior to the proclamation of the various pieces of legislation so that the actual flows that will be going into the various rivers, what water will be available for irrigation and what water will be available for power generation will be known.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That really had to occur because if you have a corporatised body they have to know what sort of assets they have got and where it will be going, rather than saying, `We're now corporatised, we've got this big debt,' only to find that a lot of asset might disappear as part of the inquiry. But a number of people were still not happy with that situation, and I think part of it comes from a misunderstanding of how the three pieces of legislation work. It was seen when the New South Wales legislation was introduced into the parliament of New South Wales some months ago that if that legislation was passed, then there was no real control about the water inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I guess it is a matter of trust. When you have three separate pieces of legislation from three separate governments and they are not all of the same political persuasion, which is relevant in this debate, there are certain safeguards there at the end of the day. I do understand the concerns that have been expressed by many of my constituents about ensuring that there are environmental flows in the Snowy River. Certainly the Snowy River is an icon in Australia, it is certainly an icon in my electorate, and I want to make sure that the appropriate decisions are made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a variety of studies that have taken place. There was a scoping study which was conducted by the New South Wales Department of Land and Water Conservation, the Victorian Department of Conservation and Natural Resources and the Snowy Mountains Hydro&hyphen;electric Authority. That scoping study unfortunately has never been made public; publicly we are really unaware of the exact outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been another study done by the scientific world which came up with a percentage flow that would be required for the Snowy of something in the order of 28 per cent of its original flows. Currently, the flow into the Snowy is probably about one per cent of the original river flows. The agreement that is there at the moment sees something like about 25 megalitres of water a day released from the Jindabyne Dam.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9758">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was reasonably comfortable with the way in which the legislation was put together between the three states and the safeguards there were to ensure that the correct decision was made out of the water inquiry before proclamation. It has fallen off the rails, I guess, to some extent inasmuch as the New South Wales legislation did not go through. The New South Wales legislation was to be used as the mechanism to start the water inquiry. It concerns me that that legislation did not pass and therefore the water inquiry has not got under way. I do not want to see a situation occur in which, because of other pressures, we might be faced with pressure on the two states and the Commonwealth to pass this legislation without the appropriate work being done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know the New South Wales legislation is going back into the New South Wales parliament. I do not know the timing of that and what might occur as a result&mdash;whether it will pass or not&mdash;but it is something that I will be watching closely. Perhaps there is a role for the Commonwealth here&mdash;and I am not sure at this very moment of the legalities of doing this&mdash;to somehow get this water inquiry going. Somehow or other, either at the Commonwealth level or the state level, the water inquiry needs to start. I will watch closely what happens in New South Wales and then discuss it with the minister to see whether we can assist in any way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another aspect of this bill that will be sorted out as part of the corporatisation is the supply of water to a number of small villages in my electorate. Currently a variety of small villages in the Snowy River Shire take water from the system. There is nothing formal in place&mdash;one could say that it is almost an ad hoc arrangement&mdash;but quite a number of villages rely very heavily for their water supply on the Snowy scheme. The corporatisation will formalise that and give security but it does concern the Snowy River Shire that they do not have that security at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might foreshadow here that if we have any further great delay in this legislation, either at a federal level or through the states, I will consider introducing a private member's bill to give that security of water supply in the interim. It would be a sunset situation: once this corporatisation is completed, it would lapse. There is certainly considerable concern amongst many of the small villages that they might get caught up in the wrangling between the states and the Commonwealth and they would like to see that security. It would be a very simple matter to provide that security now and it would finish as a piece of legislation once the corporatisation is completed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will be looking at that. Once again, it will depend on the likelihood of the New South Wales legislation passing and the water inquiry getting under way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I am in support of this legislation with the various qualifications that I have mentioned. It sounds like throwing balls up in the air and not being sure which one to catch first. When you are dealing with a very complex issue like this, where there are two states and the Commonwealth involved, it is inevitable that that will occur. The Snowy scheme requires this legislation to be an efficient and competitive entity in the electricity market for the future. It produces excellent electricity in the overall scope of things, particularly so far as greenhouse gases are concerned. Hydro-electricity is the most efficient in that respect and I think we have a great system that can possibly be developed even further in the years to come under a corporatised body.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the Snowy Hydro Corporatisation Bill 1997, which lays the foundation for the creation of a financially viable entity to operate on a competitive mutual basis and to participate in the emerging national electricity market. It is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9759"> important to recognise that this bill, which creates the company Snowy Hydro Ltd, and transfers current assets and liabilities, is the result of an agreement between the Commonwealth, New South Wales and Victorian governments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While welcoming the bill, I must say that many of my constituents in the Murrumbidgee and Coleambally irrigation areas had some reservations about the proposal and I will refer to a number of those concerns. As the other speakers have said, the Snowy Mountains Hydro&hyphen;Electric Scheme played a significant role in the development of Australia as a nation and is regarded as a national icon. Its construction, at a cost of $1 billion, represented a massive investment for Australia in the postwar era. Today it is recognised as one of the truly great engineering feats of the modern world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The project brought together 100,000 workers from 30 countries, the vast majority of them being migrants wanting to carve out a new life for themselves in Australia following the end of the Second World War. In fact, my next&hyphen;door neighbour in Griffith for many years, Marco Visentin, an Australian of Italian heritage, worked on the scheme, sometimes up to his armpits in nearly freezing water. The friendships he made on the scheme nearly 50 years ago still endure, as does his love of trout fishing in the streams of the Snowy Mountains.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The scheme is widely recognised as the birthplace of multiculturalism in Australia. Construction started in 1949 and was completed 25 years later, collecting almost all of the water which previously flowed down the Snowy River on the eastern side of the Great Dividing Range. The scheme was designed to divert the flow westwards into the Murray&hyphen;Darling Basin to the irrigation areas along the Murray and Murrumbidgee rivers to provide essential drought security to the vast dry inland of south&hyphen;eastern Australia. The Snowy, with its network of 16 major dams with a storage capacity 13 times the volume of Sydney Harbour, power stations, tunnels and aqueducts, became a major electricity generator in mainland Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The corporatisation of the Snowy Mountains Hydro&hyphen;Electric Scheme has been a complex issue, but the commitment to corporatisation has remained constant despite changes of governments. Although there is general commitment to corporatisation, the Murrumbidgee Valley Water Users Association in my electorate of Riverina has some concerns about the future cost of water under the new arrangement and any cuts in flows along the river systems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The users association is an organisation involving delegates from 12 local government areas, the Lowbidgee League and Great Southern Energy. It takes in the federal electorates of Riverina, Farrer and Hume. It was formed in 1939 to promote the development of the valley through the economical and sustainable use of water. One of its first undertakings was to promote the Snowy Mountains scheme and the diversion of water to the dry inland. One gentleman who was at meetings where the scheme was proposed, and who is still a member of the Murrumbidgee Valley Water Users Association, is Councillor Bill Blacker of Leeton Shire.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This visionary project has provided the incredible economic development within the region and resulted in the development of one of Australia's major food bowls. While the Murray Valley Water Users Association has no objection to corporatisation, it is most concerned to ensure that the water continues to be diverted westward at no cost to the irrigation authorities for the continued sustainable production of food. This concern has been the subject of ongoing representation to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson). As recently 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9760"> as August, a delegation from the water users association met with the minister's representative to air their concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Snowy Mountains Authority was originally established to generate electricity and to supply water to downstream users at no cost. The water users argued that this arrangement must continue in perpetuity and be built into any agreement of sale. Water users want any agreement of sale to enshrine the right of extractive users to access the water released by the Snowy Mountains Authority free of charge to the relevant water distribution authority, whether that be the government, state operated corporations or some subsequently privatised authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The organisation believes strategic releases of water are vital to improve the health of inland rivers, and certainly the Murrumbidgee River has its share of problems. Controlled water flows are essential in combating problems such as the decline in native fish numbers, the decline in wetlands, algal blooms which are caused by soil erosion and stream bank erosion and the European carp infestation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the most pressing problems for the Murrumbidgee River is the control of salinity. This is mainly dry land salinity as little irrigation drainage finds its way back into the river. This requires a flushing of the system at various times and is mostly provided for by the normal irrigation flows and periods of high river flow. I am pleased, therefore, to see within the bill under `Water rights' that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Water will not be an asset of Snowy Hydro. The existing rights of the Scheme with respect to water will be continued under a licence granted by the appropriate NSW water authority.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The water licence will be in respect of an agreed geographical area; specify Snowy Hydro's right to use, collect, divert, store and release the water; provide that the Snowy Hydro's water rights are subject to the rights of certain water users to extract up to a total of three gigalitres per annum from within the area; be for an initial term of 75 years with a 50-year renewal option; and be capable of amendment by the appropriate New South Wales water authority through an agreed process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Financial consideration will also be provided to Snowy Hydro by New South Wales if such amendments have an adverse material financial impact on the company. Apart from fees under the water licence, no other charges will be imposed on Snowy Hydro in relation to water.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also note that in relation to water releases the water licence will set out Snowy Hydro's water release obligations. Unless otherwise agreed, those water release obligations will be consistent with the existing arrangements governing the scheme. In any case they will: protect Victoria's existing right to a share of inflows into the scheme; protect South Australia's existing rights, and the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) previously said something about that; prescribe minimum release volumes in time of drought; provide for variations in releases in emergency situations; include provisions for consultation between Snowy Hydro and the relevant water authorities; and provide for the outcomes of the water inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Presently, there are many rapid changes taking place in relation to the care and control of waterways throughout Australia as communities and authorities work to overcome problems that have developed over many years and ensure the long-term viability of a water system which, in the case of the Murray&hyphen;Darling system, supports many people, towns, cities and industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the rehabilitation of the Murray-Darling Basin river system is essential, any moves made to change the water usage patterns on the system should be based on scientific fact and not on the perceptions and/or rantings of the uninformed and the verbose.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9761">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If governments wish to have communities, particularly those based on irrigation, work in partnership with them then they must present facts to those people and not theories that are not subject to intellectual academic rigour. In this way there will be cooperation between governments, the bureaucracy and an irrigation community that believes in sustainable agriculture and cares for the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The recent imposition of caps on water usage for irrigators is a case in point. Water users question the imposition of caps on the release of water from the Snowy Mountains and argue the cap system will not benefit the environment but will cause considerable economic loss to the Murrumbidgee valley and the nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Murrumbidgee Valley Water Users Association is pressing the federal government not to implement a permanent cap on diversions but rather to take measures to ensure the real environmental problems be addressed on a valley by valley basis to ensure the future health of our rivers. The association wants the government to take urgent measures to instigate research into the control of European carp and urges the New South Wales government to remove any restrictions on the use of responsible electrical stunning of fish to harvest European carp. The association wants the New South Wales government to implement sound, scientifically based management practices in conjunction with the proposed river catchment committees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the European carp problem, these fish stir up the sediments on the bottom of the river and remove natural vegetation which acts as a sink for nutrients, and they feed on the Daphne flea which eat the blue-green algae. The control of carp is of prime and urgent importance to the health of our rivers and without that control all other measures will have little impact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth noting that a factory turning carp into fertiliser has been an outstanding success but cannot operate in New South Wales waters because the proprietors are not allowed to operate an electric stunning device on a permanent basis. The harvesting of carp may not be the permanent answer but it will provide a more effective control than is presently available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also worth noting that if a virus for carp control was released, with carp at their present numbers, the numbers of carp deaths would use up all available oxygen when the carp decomposed, possibly causing a massive kill off of native fish. Therefore, it is essential to reduce the numbers of carp before implementing any biological control.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst speaking on the corporatisation of the Snowy Mountains scheme, there is a matter relating to water quality that I would like placed on record. I believe the CSIRO, working with the Griffith City Council, has found a way to reduce to a minimum the phosphates and nitrates that are present in sewage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conjunction with the CSIRO, the Griffith City Council has embarked on a major trial over the last three years or so to test a system called `Filter'. This process is aimed at reducing to a minimum, and EPA acceptable levels, the amount of phosphorus and sewage effluent. As you would be aware, these nutrients are the major cause of algal blooms in receival waters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">`Filter' is an exciting but simple agricultural solution to an urban problem and has national and international potential which is being explored. The trial has been in progress at the Griffith sewage treatment site and has proved extremely successful. To date approximately $1 million has been expended. The land and water resources department and the Environmental Planning Authority have been closely consulted on the project. The council is now gearing up for a full size pilot of approximately 15 hectares of the `Filter' scheme, to prove its 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9762"> commercial viability. Once trialled at this scale, the aim is to construct another 100 hectares to treat the entire effluent produced by Griffith and its connected villages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Council has applied for Natural Heritage Trust moneys to assist in this project through the urban water directorate and land and water conservation. It is to be hoped that money can be obtained through the Natural Heritage Trust, or elsewhere, to continue this work, which not only has local benefits but could have tremendous potential both nationally and internationally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would especially like to place on record the work done by Dr John Blackwell and his team at the CSIRO in Griffith on this project. While on the subject of the CSIRO, I would remind the House of the establishment of a national centre for irrigation science in Griffith. This has been confirmed by the CSIRO land and water chief, Dr Graham Harris, on more than one occasion. The establishment of this institute will involve a close partnership between the CSIRO, the Charles Sturt University in Wagga Wagga and all centres carrying out irrigation research. The establishment of a chair of irrigation sciences at Wagga Wagga campus of the CSU, with Wayne Meyer as founding professor, was a vital element of this proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the failure of the legislation to pass the New South Wales upper house, it was the intention of this legislation, prior to proclamation in full of any corporatisation legislation of the states, to sponsor a public inquiry into environment issues arising out of the current pattern of water flows caused by the operation of the scheme, in accordance with the agreed terms of reference. The inquiry will submit to the states comprehensive, costed options to address the issues considered by the inquiry within six months of its commencement. Thereafter, the states will consider the final report of the inquiry and agree upon a final outcome within two months or such other time as may be agreed by them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I repeat that any inquiry or inquiries by the federal and state governments will need to be carried out with intellectual and academic vigour, and to consider the consultative input of all water user groups to make use of the water for the Snowy Mountains scheme. Only in this way will the best interests of the nation be served.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the report on aspects of youth suicide, which arose from the seminar of the Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs, it is very disturbing to note that in Australia we have such a high youth suicide rate. A quarter of young male deaths in 1995, I think it was, could be attributed to youth suicide, and 17 per cent of young females, similarly. This, of course, is only a small proportion of youth suicide attempts that have been made. We know that at least 10 hospitalised attempts are made for every successful attempt that is undertaken. We know that many suicide attempts are made beyond those which do not result in hospitalisation. We know that the figures have increased over time and we know that the Australian youth suicide is higher than in the United States of America, New Zealand and many European countries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9763">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prior to becoming a parliamentarian, some time ago, I was a youth worker and worked with street kids in youth refuges and the like. My observation in that time, in working with many young people who endeavoured to take their own lives, or engaged in risk&hyphen;taking behaviours, was that there is no single cause, no single factor, that I could observe amongst the various young people that I worked with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was a multitude of factors&mdash;sometimes single factors, sometimes a combination of them&mdash;at play when a young person was engaged in risk&hyphen;taking behaviour, or when they actually physically endeavoured to take their life and unfortunately, sometimes, succeeded. With things like early intervention strategies, safe and affordable housing to escape abusive situations, and access to help and support, quite often young people were able to turn their lives around.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sadly curious factor of youth suicide in Australia is the disturbingly high proportion of young men, particularly from the bush, who endeavour to take&mdash;and succeed in taking&mdash;their own lives. I think there are quite a few factors at play here. In my experience, these are often issues of sexuality, abuse in childhood, institutionalisation, unemployment, substance use and the implications that that brings with the involvement of the criminal justice system, and the interaction of the criminal justice system and young people themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sometimes they are issues of race; sometimes they are the lack of skills&mdash;whether it is literacy or general life skills&mdash;sometimes they are issues of transportation, a sense of isolation; sometimes there are changes to things like social security and income support mechanisms that young people desperately need. Quite often, there is a sense of being scapegoated, where young people are essentially blamed for the circumstances which they quite often find themselves in as a consequence of societal dysfunction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not believe that we should turn the heat up further on Australia's young people by scapegoating them for things like high unemployment. Of course there are more young people than there are jobs going, and the temptation occasionally for policy makers is to blame, or scapegoat, the people who find themselves in the circumstance of trying to find work, rather than to actively support them to progress their lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think it is helpful in this debate to push particular ideological wheelbarrows and to try to use this extremely disturbing and unhappy aspect of our society to justify changes which are fundamentally ideologically driven. We have to take a very broad and open&hyphen;minded approach to the issue of youth suicide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have noted that earlier speakers have referred to some observations that have been made about a correlation between religious participation in Australia and young people's suicide endeavours and various trends. I think that issue is a bit of an oversimplification. Sometimes, factors which manifest themselves as an outcome cannot necessarily be seen as a cause of young people seeking to take their own lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the time remaining to me, I would like to talk a little about this concept of reciprocal obligation, because this government in particular has talked a lot about reciprocal obligation. It has consistently demanded of young people that they reciprocate an obligation back to society for things which we, as a fair society, believe they should be able to receive, such as income support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to examine the reciprocal obligation of the government back to young people themselves. We demand of young people that they be available, for example, for employment, or education, if it is available. We demand of them that they observe the laws of this 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9764"> parliament. What perhaps young people should be seeking is a reciprocal obligation from the parliament itself to themselves for essentially a social contract that part of its endeavour is to eliminate the causes of youth suicide, devising a system of, for example, social welfare which does not seek to scapegoat or blame young people for the shortcomings of our society but seeks to assist them to overcome disadvantages that they may find within it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This contract needs to guarantee to young people that we, as elected members, work to ensure that they are protected from exploitation, have access to affordable housing, have access to real jobs and training opportunities, have access to intervention mechanisms if they are necessary to stop young people who are at risk from committing suicide&mdash;access to the sorts of things which often the young people that I worked with as a youth worker did not have access to. That kind of social contract with young people needs to ensure that the causes of youth suicide are eliminated from society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this debate, as I have said, we do not want to be overly simplistic. We do not really need to bring a whole range of prejudices to this debate; we need to be open&hyphen;minded about it. We need to pledge ourselves to eliminate division and disharmony from our community. With the government insisting that young people uphold their part of the social contract in order to access the social welfare system, we, as parliamentarians, need to ensure that we uphold our part of that contract.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A lot of speeches have been made in this place and elsewhere about seeking specific obligations from young people themselves to the community. It mystifies me why we, as parliamentarians, cannot make specific obligations back to them. Most notable, of course, is a specific undertaking that we will reduce youth unemployment, for example, or increase employment and training opportunities by a specified target. When you are a young person and you are without accommodation, when you have come from an abusive family, when you have come into contact with the criminal justice system at an early age, when you have worked on the streets, when you have got difficulties with literacy and numeracy, when you may have substance issues, when you may be the subject of a fair amount of abuse because of your sexuality or what have you, when you may be isolated because of lack of transport in the bush, when you may have difficulties in obtaining just basic income support, when you do not have a lot of hope, it is a reasonable ask of this parliament that it makes a specific undertaking to those young people and it reciprocates the obligation which it so often demands of young people themselves.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to acknowledge the work that the Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs have done in the preparation of this report and the national forum on youth suicide held earlier this year. I would also like to make a few points however in relation to the community, particularly in my electorate of Herbert.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Earlier this year, I tried to get information relating to the incidence of suicide on Palm Island. Palm Island is a deed of grant in trust island under the Queensland Aboriginal affairs act which lies about 40 kilometres off the coast of Townsville. It is quite a large island and it is in the electorate of Herbert.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first thing I discovered when I tried to get information and accurate details on the incidence of youth suicide on Palm Island was that indeed it was very difficult. I and my staff were shuffled from one person to another and from one government body to another. I am concerned that suicide, and particularly youth suicide, in communities such as Palm Island 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9765"> is in danger of developing the point of view `Out of sight, out of mind'. It is very concerning indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When someone is murdered on Palm Island then the media reports it, but rarely, if at all, does the media report the incidence of suicide attempts, and those suicide attempts at this stage are running at about one every four weeks on the island. I do not want to appear to be lumping the problem on the backs of the media only, but if the information is not there for the media or any other member of the public to access then how are they going to be able to report on it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe a system of accurate reporting and recording of the incidence of suicide, and youth suicide in particular, should be introduced&mdash;a system that takes into consideration attempted suicide. I would like to think that one already exists. After all, we seem to be able to assess national and state statistics. But after the trouble I have had in trying to gather local information relating to Palm Island, I have to ask the question: is the system of reporting really good enough?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After talking to the Palm Island Aboriginal Council and the state health department earlier this year, I learnt that on Palm Island there had been two suicide deaths and a further 12 suicide attempts since the beginning of the year. Since then a few months have passed and so I expect that the number would have increased. In the 1996 calendar year there were six hangings resulting in deaths; between August and December 1996 there were a further three suicide attempts. While I believe these reported statistics to be accurate, I am still waiting for formal confirmation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, there are some major problems on Palm Island crossing a variety of areas such as employment, education, access to health and welfare services, and isolation. While I know that we as a government have made tremendous steps in addressing suicide as an issue, I am concerned that the action we have been taking could prove ineffective on Palm Island.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has focused a lot of effort on the provision of telephone crisis counselling services, and rightly so. I have a close association with, for example, Lifeline in Townsville and their director, the Reverend Ev Blackman. I know the work they do in telephone counselling and that it saves lives on a daily basis. However, earlier this year I tried to phone the Palm Island Aboriginal Council to make appointments for constituent visits. For more than a day, phone and fax services to the island were not available due to Telstra cabling faults. Suicide simply does not wait for phone services to be restored.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Access to public phones on Palm Island is very limited indeed. There is only one reliable public phone, located in a retail store on the island, but it cannot be accessed outside normal business hours. The three public phones outside the post office are all out of order as a result of vandalism. There are only 259 phone services on Palm Island, the vast majority of which are private phones. These phones service a population of about 4,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am concerned also that telephone crisis counselling services may not be culturally appropriate to addressing the needs of the Palm Island Aboriginal community. The Palm Island Council has expressed concern that, as well as not having ready access to phones on the island, people would not want to talk to a total stranger over the phone. It is just the cultural appropriateness aspect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Palm Island Women's Centre coordinator Delena Foster believes the community needs more counsellors on the island so that face&hyphen;to&hyphen;face counselling sessions can be conducted. Another suggestion is that a youth conference be organised so that the young people can sit down 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9766"> together, discuss the issue of youth suicide and look at possible solutions to address the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to report to the House that the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) has announced that former senator Neville Bonner is going to go to the island to spend a considerable period of time assessing what he sees are the needs and demands of that island community. Ex&hyphen;senator Bonner is a very experienced person, a person who has already lived on Palm Island and has family on Palm Island. I believe that the report that Neville Bonner will produce for the minister will be very valuable indeed in directing where government resources should be best targeted to meet the needs of the Palm Island community. I am looking forward to that visit and that report from Neville Bonner when he moves to Palm Island in the near future.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, before the division I was telling the House that the government had decided to appoint former senator Neville Bonner to go to Palm Island and to report back to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs in relation to the needs of the island and how the government might best address those needs. One of those needs will concern the youth suicide element. In meeting with the Palm Island Council last week, there was certainly a very great concern amongst the councillors for the young people of Palm Island and how they might stop this terrible situation happening on the island with the suicide and the attempted suicides.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I am advised, there are two principal contributing factors to youth suicide. One of those is the standard of education and the other is the status of employment of the person concerned. I am very pleased to report to the House that unemployment in the Townsville region continues to fall. In the first 18 months of the new government, unemployment has fallen from 10.1 per cent down to now about 5.9 per cent. It is a very good result for Townsville and a very good result for the region. That in some way addresses the situation in relation to the unemployment aspect of youth suicide. Certainly with Townsville becoming the fastest growing regional area in the country, I expect unemployment to continue to fall in our city. With the prospects that are there and what I know of the development of our community I believe that the city is going to go further in that direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During Senator Herron's visit to Palm Island last week, Mr Deputy Speaker, there was a long discussion with the Aboriginal council. The chairperson of the council, Councillor Pina Geia, and also a young councillor, Robert Blackley, were most keen to impress upon the minister the need to look at how that community is operating and how best the government might help them. One of the interesting results of that meeting was that it was not a question of, `Mr Minister, please give us more money'; it was a question of `We would like to help ourselves.' It is tremendously refreshing in an Aboriginal community to see that kind of response coming from an Aboriginal council. I take my hat off to the council for being proactive and for certainly being concerned about the terrible conditions on the island.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a quick aside, Mr Deputy Speaker, I think that this country has condemned the Aboriginal community to a life of poverty and welfare dependence. The sooner we get them off that cycle the better, and certainly that is the feeling in the Palm Island Aboriginal community.</PARA>

The government has a direct responsibility to play a hand in this battle but so does the community. I recognise that the problem of youth suicide cannot be fixed overnight. It is a long&hyphen;term problem and it needs to be attacked year after year in a coordinated manner, across a variety of social and economic fields. I am pleased that the issue of youth suicide is being tackled in a very much bipartisan way, as it should be. Certainly the previously speaker, the member for Fraser (Mr Dargavel) referred to that and I support him in his suggestions. There are some issues which are just too important to be buried in party politics, and youth suicide is one of them.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The presentation of this report of the Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs could not have come too soon. Suicide, and particularly suicide by young people, is a tragedy that it is difficult for many of us to comprehend. Unfortunately, in Australia it is a tragedy that occurs too often. Members would be aware that Australia has one of the highest rates of youth suicide in the industrialised world. I am glad the committee has taken up this issue and did not put it on the backburner.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the record, on 27 September in 1993, I wrote to then chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs urging the committee to instigate an inquiry into suicide with particular emphasis on suicides amongst young people. Unfortunately, that was not taken up. I reinforced my call for an inquiry into youth suicide on 3 February in 1994, in a speech to the House of Representatives. Suffice to say, nothing eventuated. I do not intend that to be taken as a reflection on the former committee, but it was an issue I thought was needing desperately to be investigated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Suicide is a topic people find difficult to discuss. Indeed, it is often considered taboo to talk about. However, brushing it aside will not help us address the problem and look for solutions, if there are solutions. By discussing suicide and the fact that there is help&mdash;and that suicide is not an alternative&mdash;we may help someone contemplating taking their own life to talk about their problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the 10 years to 1995, in my own home state of Western Australia, there were 434 suicides by young people: 338 in urban areas and 96 in rural areas. It is now too late to ask those young people, who were in the prime of their lives, why they did not wish to continue living. We lost 434 Western Australians in that one year who should still be with us today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Suicide is a difficult policy issue to address. How do we as, policy makers and law makers, make decisions to prevent suicide. Obviously, the reasons why someone decides to take their life are many and varied. Is it possible for a government to prevent all of these suicides, or even some of them? Of course, that is a question that cannot be properly answered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note the first recommendation of the committee is that a national advisory council on youth suicide prevention be established to provide strategic advice to the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) on youth suicide prevention and related matters. It is suggested that this council would provide policy advice at the very highest level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My personal observation is that the participants on that committee, or the people who should be consulted, are those most vulnerable&mdash;young people. The young people involved should not just be those with a good education or from professional sectors of the work force or high profile young people. It should include young unemployed people, young people with disabilities, and others who have been recognised as in the high risk areas. Let them give their 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9768"> perspective on policies which may help prevent suicide and also on policies which may unfortunately contribute to suicide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to do all we can to prevent suicide. With most deaths, families and friends know that they are blameless. However, with suicide, family and friends of someone who takes their life feel guilty for what has occurred. They do take the blame. They ask that big question: why? What should I have  done to stop this? A question we, as policy makers, should also be asking is: what can we do to prevent suicide?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that I cannot answer that question. This report will hopefully be the first step in providing those answers. Rather than offering my thoughts any further, I would like to read to the chamber part of an essay from Catherine Whisson, a young Western Australian delegate to the Australian Youth Forum which took place here in Canberra earlier this year. I thought is something worth taking in because she and her peers are representative of the people that we are talking about here today, and the people that we are trying to help. She wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was fortunate to have a loving family and friends to help through some dark times. When I was diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) I felt alone. CFS is a little known debilitating illness causing social, physical and emotional problems. My whole life went through upheaval as I tried to cope on my own in the city, after a recent move from Busselton for study and employment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It wasn't until I felt there was hope for the future that I began to take control of my life again and regain my confidence to `Seize the day'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Young people also need to know there's hope. They need to know they are precious, that reality can be better than fantasies built by drug highs and short lived sexual gratification. That they can be loved for who they are. Lack of confidence and lack of self esteem are killing our young people. We need to address the root of the problems, as well as their side effects, before it's too late.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I've found my music and songwriting is a valuable and effective tool in breaking down barriers, touching people and uniting them. Australia can take advantage of this process by utilising the arts, theatres, sporting facilities, landscape, and the atmosphere that is unique to each area in encouraging young people to better their talents to try new skills. It's not just about finding something for a young person to do to fill their time, it's</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">about creating an environment that is challenging and inspirational, while allowing young people to meet with others and establish a network of friends.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ideas that I want to take to Canberra for discussion have come from personal experience, growing in the isolation of the country. I also want to take other people's thoughts, opinions and life experiences, so I have spent considerable time with a broad range of young people from around Perth and country areas. Some of their concerns and desires for them as young people are included.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I passionately believe that young people need encouragement and understanding in their family, school and community environments. Increased esteem among young people builds confidence and stops the onset of the tragedies that plague many of Australia's youth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Suicide is rapidly increasing in our society today. Young people are finding too much stress placed on them through relationships, study, employment, and they feel that there is nowhere to turn. Most young people contemplating suicide just want attention and need someone to take some time with them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People that have experienced the pain of going through various tragedies such as drug abuse, attempted suicide, prison and loss of a loved one should be encouraged to share their insight. Many people find they go through rehabilitation only to return to the community still lacking a sense of direction. Without necessary support, friendship and encouragement they may return to their old ways. Our community can support these people with inclusion in projects that enhance their esteem. Young people can relate to what they view as `real people with real problems' and so these people give hope to the prevention of these pressing issues. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9769">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a symptom of young people feeling worthless, not a complete person, like someone who has nothing to give to society. It is a hopelessness where no&hyphen;one can hear the silent cries. Despair can be a place like the black hole without compassion or understanding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We need to utilise projects that will benefit our community, projects that will create an atmosphere that will give young people hands&hyphen;on experience, creativity, and allow them to `let off steam' through positive mediums such as sculpture, product design in furniture, coffee shops, landscaping, sports programs, music, theatre and arts. One&hyphen;on&hyphen;one friendships and support networks are nurtured through those activities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A suggestion is to base it at a house where young people are free to come any time, free to talk confidentially, and encouraged to spread their wings. This house will provide security and readily available information and help on issues ranging from health, education and employment, et cetera, in a non&hyphen;threatening manner. Professional people, for example, doctors and nurses and counsellors and so on, will be encouraged to come and speak at workshops to young people, parents and the caring community. Projects listed above would operate from this house, going out into the community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Volunteers would need to be someone that youth could relate to, be on the same level, trustworthy, caring, passionate and empathetic, good listeners, and make a difference. A mobile unit of people having these qualities, for example, doctors, counsellors, compassionate young people, well-known citizens and identities, would go out to suburbs and rural areas enthusing and implementing projects, et cetera.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Every individual is unique no matter the past, the background, the future, your family, your finance, your intelligence or your capabilities. You're you! So be you! You can make it even when you are left on your own or people do not put their trust in you. Stand up, be tall, encourage and lift up the person next to you. Standing hand in hand, you can make it. You are precious, with qualities the next person does not have. Like a body, each part plays an important role. Without one, life would die.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you can see from the comments by the young people I have interviewed or who have contacted me, they have firm, rational and worthwhile ideas to improve their own futures. It is the responsibility of the leaders of our nation to respond in a serious and sensitive manner.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I commend Catherine on her essay and for her maturity and youth. It is those views we need to take in and listen to when addressing this most important issue. I commend the committee for its work.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I congratulate the members of the Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs who organised this topical and important seminar. Australia has the fourth highest rate of male suicide in the developed world according to news reports out recently. Why are so many Australians committing suicide? All of us in this parliament have a firm belief that our youth is Australia's future. We are all here, irrespective of our political colours, to make a contribution towards helping our political, social and economic institutions progress, and to help leave Australia a better place, even if only slightly better, than we inherited from those who went before us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A recent book by Bronwyn Donaghy, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Leaving Early</EMPHASIS>, analysed many case studies of suicide and found that the key factors in Australian male suicide are isolation and fear of difference. There are higher suicide rates than usual in many country towns; the presence of guns seems to be an added factor. When men attempt suicide, they usually succeed. I cannot but think that we are to some extent failing Australia's youth and, in so doing, robbing Australia of her future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Youth suicide, or, indeed, suicide by whatever demographic group in whatever location and by whichever method, is all too prevalent in Australia. It is a tragic final solution to life. For youth, it has become a convenient final escape from their place in society. For those they have left behind, it is a closed window of mystery, distress, grief and a longing search for an answer. All of us in this parliament, I suspect, have come at some stage face to face with 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9770"> suicide, be it in our own associations or through contact with many people who walk in through our office doors, write to us or telephone us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A few weeks back, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Illawarra Mercury</EMPHASIS> published a two&hyphen;page spread headed, `Bundanoon, a town in mourning'. Bundanoon is a beautiful small town located in the Southern Highlands, a stone's throw from my coastal electorate, and it is a place that I used to represent. The population is just 1,800 and five men have killed themselves within the past four weeks. The men ranged in age from 19 to 77. All were known to one another; two were best mates who suicided just 11 days apart.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An Anglican minister, the Reverend Wayne Tidsley, with the support of community groups like Lifeline and the Rose Foundation, along with Wingecarribie Shire Council, called together the community to ask why, to try to discover the answers to how more incidents could be prevented and to comfort those who had lost their loved ones. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Illawarra Mercury</EMPHASIS> reported:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The youngest victim, 19, had a secure life and a bright future. He was nothing like the stereotypical young suicide victim. He was working with his dad in the family tree&hyphen;clearing business and he was popular. He had prospects, money in the bank, and the support of his mum, dad, and older sister, but none of that was in his mind on August 29 when he killed himself.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This young Australian joins the six Australians each day who suicide and leave behind loved ones who will forever ask the question, why?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report highlights some factors which may trigger suicidal thoughts and behaviour: the loss of a family member or a close friend; divorce in the family or a major family upheaval; the break&hyphen;up of a relationship; excessive use of drugs or alcohol; confusion over sexuality or rejection because of sexuality; and school friends who have suicided&mdash;or perhaps it is just pressure that seems, to the person, unbearable. Australia, like the rest of the world, has become a more complex place in which to live. There are enormous pressures and difficulties in life today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For too many Australians, particularly youth, the constant pressure is often unbearable. We have become a community in which we ignore the essential element of what a community is, and that is people. We all seem to find comfort in the excuse that there are a mountain of things that we need to tend and react to. We are becoming a people who just race through each day. Reflection seems to come about when it is just too late.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was interested in reading an article recently&mdash;and I think it was in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>&mdash;by Dr Peter West, where he analysed some of these aspects. He wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is tragic that suicide is something Australian males seem to be hugely successful at. Maybe high rates of teenage suicide amongst males suggest that we need to let boys express their feelings. The Australian media seems to be telling us that the pinnacle of achievement for a man is success in sport. Too often, the only patterns boys see modelled by males of television and in homes are anger and drunken revelry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Why do Greece, Italy and Spain have the lowest rates of male suicide in the developed world? These countries allow men a wider range of emotions than we do in Australia. Their men are more physical. They hug and kiss, and aren't afraid to put their arms around each other. They are not societies in which a man can easily be gay. But surely we can learn from the way their men are valued?</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I sincerely do not want to make any political capital about what I am about to say, as I believe this discussion is much too important. I think it has been a very worthwhile discussion&mdash;what I have heard of it in this second chamber&mdash;but I have never seen an Australia so confused and insecure. What does it say about the values of our community that we insist on focusing on the bottom line, of doing more with much less, of this mantra of downsizing, restructuring, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9771"> corporatisation and privatisation? What does it say about the values of our community when our young people leave their schools, TAFE and university and cannot find any work?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, what does it say about the values of our community when there are people in their 20s, 30s and 40s who wake up each morning to go to work, only to come back in the late afternoon with no work to go to the next day? What does it say about the values of our community when a large proportion of the population does not know the name of their next&hyphen;door neighbour?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australians have available to themselves a much wider range of social choices than once before, but this freedom over the range of choices available has been associated with much greater isolation and loneliness for far too many. These are the issues that we as a parliament, and we as a community, need to address. I must say that our suicide figures tell us that we indeed have a long way to go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like so many of my colleagues here, I find suicide a tragedy. But let me make a point. I am opposed to suicide and, indeed, I am opposed to capital punishment&mdash;I have always been opposed to this. I spoke in this very chamber, and in the House, and voted in favour of the Northern Territory euthanasia legislation some months back. I see no contradiction in this, although it was put to me that there was a contradiction. Euthanasia should not be confused with suicide. They are vastly different, and I suggest the motives leading to the decisions are totally different.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do think that this seminar on aspects of youth suicide has been very important. Perhaps other committees of the parliament should do much more of this work. Again, I congratulate all those associated with the seminar. I thought it was a very important seminar, and as other people have said, at a very important time, a very topical time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the future of Australia and the future of Australia's youth, this report is groundbreaking and an important step. I commend it to the chamber.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3K6">Mr ROSS CAMERON</NAME><ELECTORATE> (Parramatta)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(12.07 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a member of the Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs present on the day of the seminar, I concur with the concluding remarks of the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) that it was certainly an excellent exercise. I congratulate the then chair of the committee, the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) and also the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), who underscored the importance of this issue by being present and, in fact, opening the day's proceedings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My colleagues have ably canvassed the extent of the problem we face and the nature of the trends in Australia, and I think no&hyphen;one has risen to their feet without expressing a deep sense of concern at the tragedy which youth suicide represents for the country. Much of the discussion has focused on the alleged causes of youth suicide, on those external pressures which face young people today and which have been particularly identified as being present in many instances of youth suicide. Those pressures have included things like family trauma, divorce, grief over the death of a family member or close friend, personal isolation, unemployment, excessive use of drugs or alcohol, and the phenomenon known as contagion, whereby the example of somebody else's suicide&mdash;a person close to someone, or a role model&mdash;may influence their decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was particularly influenced and impressed by the testimony of Professor Pierre Baume, who is certainly one of the nation's leading experts on the subject. He talked about the role of depression. He said that it was not depression in isolation, but depression in combination 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9772"> with some of these other factors, that was usually present in the case of those who actually took their own lives or attempted suicide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not speak with any glibness about the subject, as a person who certainly, for periods during my teenage years and early 20s, experienced pretty serious bouts of depression. I know that Winston Churchill, throughout his life, talked about having as companion the black dog of depression. I feel a deep sense of empathy and I share with other members this real sense of concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to talk primarily, however, about the nature of our response to these problems and, in particular, the nature of the individual response to the external pressures of life. Throughout our history, human beings have been subject to pressures of various kinds&mdash;sometimes extraordinary pressures created either by natural disasters or more often, I think, by man's inhumanity to man. The extraordinary thing about our history has been not our inability to respond to those pressures so much as the extraordinary heroism, endurance, determination and capacity to find hope in the face of adverse circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to concentrate on the question not so much of why people take their own lives as of how it is that human beings manage to survive and, indeed, to thrive, very often in conditions of great adversity. A curious aspect of the present challenge is that in material terms our community has never been wealthier than it is at present. That is not to say that there are not pockets of serious poverty and disadvantage but, by comparison with previous generations, the reality is that Australians enjoy a higher standard of life today than they ever have in their history. Even the poorest in our community are, in comparative terms&mdash;while still unacceptably poor&mdash;better off than their counterparts a generation ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So why is it that we now face this increasing propensity of young people to respond to the challenges they face by terminating their lives? One of the factors that Associate Professor Pierre Baume referred to was contagion: the idea that the example of someone else committing suicide may impact on a person's decision about their own life. I rise today with a real sense of gravity, a kind of reluctance, because of a concern that our deliberations here may have the potential not to ameliorate the problem but actually to make it worse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recall the story of a community in the United States, in which there had been an outbreak of arson in a number of local schools. The mayor called upon the chief of the fire brigade to go and visit each of the schools and give a lecture to the students on the evils of arson, the result of which was a massive further outbreak in arson around the schools. The lecture had, in effect, promoted to the front of the minds of many of the young people, who had never before contemplated it, the attractions of that particular behaviour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Throsby mentioned the question of euthanasia. I do not want to reopen that here, but my objection to that legislation was largely based on a concern that, if through legislation we legitimise the taking of a person's life in response to the external circumstances, no matter how grave they may be, there is real potential for that to become an accepted choice for, for example, the young people in our community who may be facing challenges of their own.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to recognise the seriousness of those external challenges such as unemployment, such as divorce, such as family trauma, such as the death of a friend. It is the stock in trade of government; it is our first responsibility to take steps to ameliorate the impact of those factors on the community as a whole. Ultimately, our performance in that regard is the matter upon which the community will judge us, and rightly so.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9773">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I would urge this parliament and the government, at the same time, to recognise the appropriate limits of the reach and influence of government. In particular, I have a concern to avoid breaking the link between the individual and the question of responsibility for one's own decisions and actions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While some may regard me as heartless or lacking in compassion for emphasising this issue, I would vigorously defend that charge on the basis that the only humanitarian response to this problem is an upholding of the principle of human capacity and of human responsibility. One of the most famous students of this ability of human beings to rise above external challenges&mdash;to rise above adversity&mdash;is the Nobel laureate Primo Levi, and his famous work <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Moments of Reprieve</EMPHASIS> which studied the responses of those in Auschwitz during the period of the Second World War. Levi was one of about 650 in a group of Italian Jews who were locked in sealed trains and sent to Auschwitz. Only 20 of the group survived and his life's literary study was really the question of why&mdash;why did the 20 survive?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other psychologists have studied responses of those in concentration and prisoner of war camps during the Second World War in Changi and other places, and Levi's conclusions were consistent with the other studies, which suggest, for example, that a person's youth or physical fitness was not a likely indicator of their survival in the face of these enormous hardships. In fact, youth was a disadvantage. They found that things such as the presence in a person of a sense of hope about the future, a sense of mission in their life beyond their immediate circumstances, a sense of goals that were yet to be achieved that were important to them&mdash;these things were, in fact, the counterweight in a person's life which gave them this capacity to rise above the horror that they were presently experiencing and gave them the capacity to survive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I guess that is my principal concern, that it is not within our power in this chamber to so govern the fortunes and vicissitudes of life as to give anyone in this country an assurance that they will not, at some time, be faced with adversity. It is not within our power to be able to guarantee that any person's life experience will be fair or just.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you will indulge me for a moment, Mr Deputy Speaker, I recall so vividly, because of the repetition of it in my experience as a child, going to my father and complaining that some decision or another was unfair&mdash;for example, in the distribution of resources among my five brothers and sisters and I. My father's inevitable response was `Never pretend that the world is fair.' Some may say that was a harsh and uncaring response. In retrospect, it was an important and valuable response to me in that what he said was, `Your success in life will not be determined by the nature of the challenges and obstacles you face, but by the nature of your response to them.' And this is, I think, the critical question that we have to address.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While we have to look at how we ameliorate these external factors which cause insecurity, alienation, loneliness and depression, we have also got to look at how we strengthen the inner resolve of young Australians, at how we can encourage and instil that sense of mission, that sense of purpose, that sense of ambition, that sense of hope for the future, which provides a counterweight, a kind of ballast to resist the inevitable vicissitudes, the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that regard, we have got to be very careful to resist attributing blame for youth suicide on something such as government policy. While I have appreciated a very high level of bipartisanship in this debate, there have been, for example, inferences that the culpability of the government in failing to provide jobs for young people is directly causal in this question 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9774"> of youth suicide. Similarly, others have argued that the escalation of youth suicide can be attributed to alleged defects in regional development policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Frankly, I regard that line of argument as being probably the most dangerous, the most insidious, the most reprehensible of anything that I have heard, in this chamber or the other, since being elected to parliament, because we seriously run the risk of clothing the suicidal instinct with legitimacy from the highest quarter of representative authority in the land. By characterising a young person as a victim of these external pressures we risk glamorising and legitimising that most tragic of all responses&mdash;to take one's own life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I concur with previous speakers who have urged us to direct our resources and attention to what is a most grave, pressing and tragic fact of contemporary Australian life. But, in doing so, I also urge us to uphold the basic principle of personal and individual responsibility because, ultimately, it is not unemployment which kills a person, it is not depression which kills a person, it is not even isolation which kills a person. It is a gun, it is a hose pipe attached to an exhaust, it is a large number of barbiturates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have to do is strengthen the resolve of the individual in that moment, strengthen their sense of hope. It is not something that governments, in isolation, can do. In fact, it is something which we have to recruit the whole community to do. And that kind of constructive, hope oriented response is the one which I think will be most helpful. I want to conclude by saying that the development of character comes not through the absence of challenges but by resistance to them.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just want to speak briefly on the report on aspects of youth suicide by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs, not least so that I can indicate the extent to which the current report builds on work that has been done, and I hope will continue to be done, in this very important area. I am sure in this debate we have heard a recitation of a large number of facts about youth suicide, but I think some of them bear re&hyphen;emphasising because they do tell us something about the contemporary nature of the problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a fact that youth suicide in Australia is amongst the highest in the industrialised world. That is why we have to look at it with uniquely Australian solutions. The World Health Organisation statistics from 1993, which allow some comparisons internationally, show that Australia recorded the fourth highest rate in a list of 14 countries for suicide deaths amongst young males aged 15 to 24. So we have a very unenviable record in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a fact too that in that same year&mdash;and it is hard to get more contemporary figures&mdash;suicide was the recorded cause of death of more than 2,000 Australians. So it is a significant problem for the community. Sadly, 80 per cent of those were males, with 20 per cent of them aged between 15 and 24, so that is where the epidemic rests. Data show that while the rate of completed suicide is higher for males than females, the rate of attempts is about the same, suggesting that males generally use what might be regarded as more deadly methods. It is also a fact that there may be as many as 30 or 40 suicide attempts for every one that is completed among young people in Australia, so the rate could very well be higher.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also a fact that young males living in rural and remote areas have consistently higher rates of suicide than those in the city. That has been true for some time, and it does appear to be getting worse. Guns are the main method of suicide in these cases. One can hope that gun control legislation may well have a positive effect on the rate of suicide in country areas.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9775">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also a fact that male deaths by suicide in the 15&hyphen;24 age group have increased by almost 50 per cent over 15 years from 1979 to 1993. That is where I disagree a little with the previous speaker. I think when you see those trends, you have to ask why and that inevitably means you have to look at the wider society as well as the individual characteristics. Why are people making those decisions? What pressures are on them, both at the level of the individual and the broader group to which they belong? We can identify male, country, young as being the critical variables. Add to that, of course, the high rate of suicide amongst our indigenous people and you have got another group who clearly require special attention if we are to understand ways and means of reducing the impact on individuals and families in the wider community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you want to look at it in, I suppose, what might be in this context regarded as crude economic terms, in the period 1983 to 1992, an estimated 230,000 years of potential life of 15&hyphen; to 24&hyphen;year olds were lost due to suicide. I am sure we are all well aware, especially those people who have been on the committee, that research has shown that up to 90 per cent of young people who suicide have some evidence of psychiatric illness before their death. Depression is the most common of those illnesses. Risk factors for youth suicide not only include mental illness, but also alcohol and drug abuse, a history of physical and sexual abuse within their families, family breakdown generally, homelessness, unemployment and incarceration. Many of these are symptoms of the same set of problems, I think.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These risk factors, as I say, occur in greater proportion in some sections of our community. That is why we need to address these broader, as well as individual, matters. I was pleased, when I was minister, that really for the first time in a serious way, the Commonwealth government got involved with youth suicide. It has always been regarded as a matter for the state governments and had been left on their plate, so to speak. But there was clearly a lack of national focus and coordination, something that the committee has recognised, and the Commonwealth government, I think, does have a particular role to play here, not in the delivery of services but rather in ensuring that the best research is done, that there is coordination and that best practice is promoted. Because of that I launched `Here for life; a national plan for youth in distress', which was really only just beginning when we left government, together with <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Youth suicide in Australia: a background monograph</EMPHASIS>, which gave a lot of the detail that is now being used by this committee and people working in the field.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is fair to say that the Commonwealth had been concerned for some time about the mental health and wellbeing of Australia's young people, particularly those in those most disadvantaged areas, and there had been a number of initiatives developed by my predecessors to address this area of concern. For instance, in 1991, the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs funded a report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Youth suicide in Australia; prevention and strategies</EMPHASIS>. They were clearly concerned about the link between unemployment, particularly long&hyphen;term unemployment, and the possible effects on youth suicide. As a result, in 1993, there were a series of innovative projects to support the unemployed and at-risk young people as an attempt to prevent that as an outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1993 the Department of Human Services and Health, as it was then, commenced three years of funding for youth suicide prevention initiatives, particularly in rural areas since that is one of the key focuses necessary in any program, including training for youth, health and education sector staff and support for the prevention of copycat suicides that we heard about earlier.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9776">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is important to recognise in this area that we really do not know what works. These trial projects, these innovative programs, are actually critical to getting it right in the long term in terms of policy intervention. It needs to happen at every level from individual counselling to identification of risk factors, and attempting to address those, to a broader social discussion about suicide and its effects. The Commonwealth when I was minister went further and worked with state and territory health ministers on a number of additional initiatives, including the national mental health strategy which I think is still shaping what the states are doing in this area, and we tried to develop a number of innovative service models.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was also a health services for homeless youth program that piloted initiatives to provide mental health support to young people who were homeless and at risk. I think that deserves to be supported in the long term. The state and territory health ministers endorsed a joint program or a joint approach called, `The health of young Australians; a national health policy for children and young people'. I mention these because I think it is absolutely critical that, with a change of government or a change of minister, these initiatives are not dropped simply because they belonged to the other team.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As has already been indicated, it is critical that we continue to build in this very difficult area and not try to score political points about it. I think we can be quite sharp in our analysis of what it is that appears to be contributing to these growing rates. I think invariably it would be a matter that fell across the responsibility of all political parties and at all levels of government. You would not be able to find a single government who could claim to occupy a high moral ground in this area. Equally, you could not claim that any one type of government was responsible for the problem. Nonetheless, I think it should be a focus for our monitoring of the success, or otherwise, of programs that are being introduced, or failing to be introduced, by governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time, all the Australian health ministers agreed with the document `Better health outcomes for Australia' that we should aim to reduce suicide rates of people with mental illness by 15 per cent over the next 10 years. A specific target was set at that time and all ministers signed up to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we went the next step and tried to develop a national plan for youth in distress, as a result of the research that had been done, we also included significant additional funding. It was well short of what is actually needed to address the problem but, nonetheless, the first time the Commonwealth had really put serious money into this area on a coordinated basis. I welcome the fact that the current government has not only continued to do that, but has actually expanded the funding that is available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we were trying to do&mdash;and I know that a lot going on now is building on this work, and I am pleased to see that&mdash;was to provide a response that was coordinated for young people. The two major aims of the strategy were to build on the existing initiatives that were taking place in some states and to develop new and innovative practices, which would better meet the needs of young people, particularly in crisis and risk, and to integrate these new models into ongoing practice reforms in health, welfare and education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things that I know well from my time working with the health department in psychiatric services, in particular, is that there is a temptation to do your own little things and not look across borders and across disciplines to find good ways of approaching these questions. There is a bit of a temptation to re&hyphen;invent the wheel on a continuing basis. Building 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9777"> on best practice is one of the important outcomes not only of the work that we have done but also of the work recommended by the committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say I was a little surprised that one of the recommendations was the establishment of a new national group to advise the minister and the department of human services and health, because one was established with some very fine people on it. I understand it is continuing. I am not quite sure how it will relate to the recommended body, the National Advisory Council on Youth Suicide Prevention, that the committee has put before the parliament. I await with interest exactly how that might be done because some people of considerable expertise are on that committee. That really does represent, quite apart from any political spin, the best in the country. I would hope that their expertise is not lost or in some way muddled by having two bodies. I certainly will leave that to the committee and the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is very important too that, in disseminating these approaches, we are quite bold publicly. It is important that we do not develop a concern that causes us not to speak about suicide. I share some of the concerns of the previous speaker that we certainly do not want to endorse the idea that, if you are at risk in some of the ways that I have described, it is legitimate for you to see suicide as an outcome. But we have to recognise that people undertake these behaviours under conditions typically of considerable long&hyphen;term stress and so it is important for us, as a community, to be able to talk about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to identify those things in our community at the broadest level which may be leading to those big increases that I talked about: the high rate of youth suicide, the high rate of rural suicide, the high rate of male suicide and the high rate of suicide amongst indigenous people. If you look at all those categories, with the exception of maleness, all of them represent areas where you have considerable economic disadvantage. I do not think you can overlook that. It is not a political observation. It has been happening for some time in this country. As the gap between rich and poor, along with the access to resources in our community, has grown wider&mdash;and it has, in general terms&mdash;we have seen an increase in suicide. You cannot ignore the possibility that at least some of what we have seen of that increase is due precisely to the fact that these young people believe that they have no future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of us here would want to argue against that view. Because you are unemployed for a period of time does not condemn you to irrelevance and it certainly does not suggest that suicide is a legitimate way of solving your problems. Look at the other stresses that are faced by these young people along with unemployment, very low income and a perception&mdash;remember always&mdash;of a society that they are not part of. That is a very real concern here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They look at a community which is, by and large, wealthy and comfortable. Even though a lot of people are suffering from job insecurity, they look around them and see a level of material wealth and comfort within the family and make invidious comparisons with their own position. That inevitably means that they will experience a sense of despair and desperation. It is not just good enough to support them in their individual distress. We also have to look at the pressures of a wider kind on them that will lead some to break under those circumstances. Many will not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was interested to hear that the previous speaker mentioned Primo Levi. He is someone for whom I have had a great deal of admiration over many years. I have read most of his works. I think it is worth noting that, ultimately, he suicided. Despite all of the work that he had done in trying to make clear how the human spirit had triumphed, in the end he succumbed to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9778"> depression, almost certainly as a result of the appalling experiences he had during the Holocaust. Whatever his reasons, we will never know precisely why he did it. In many of his works he expounded the view that he could not, in a sense, justify his own continuing existence. Why had he survived and others not?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is that sense of worthlessness that comes through in a lot of the material about young people in distress, whether they eventually commit suicide or whether they end up on our roads or in our prisons doing something very similar. I think we need to look at that `acting out' of the problems of youth too in somewhat the same way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember being approached by a psychiatrist working in this area, but mainly working with juvenile offenders. He said for all the world he could not tell the difference between the profile of a seriously depressed and suicidal young person and a young person who is out on the road stealing cars or breaking and entering or sniffing glue. They basically had the same problems with their own self-esteem, as well as the same social circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Suicide, in that sense, is a symptom of a broader social problem. Of course, it is a tragedy for the individuals who finally do commit suicide, and for many others. It is something that, as a community, we have to speak about clearly. We have to indicate that we understand it is not just an individual response but that it is in the context of social pressures which governments can and should alleviate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The death of a loved one is always sad. A premature death, the death of a young person, is particularly painful. But suicide, the self-imposed, premature ending of a young life, is a tragedy which is devastating for those associated with it and it cuts to the very heart of our community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The facts are alarming. In 1995, 350 young men and 84 young women took their own lives. In the last 30 years the young male suicide rate has almost trebled, and for young females it has doubled. We have seen a similar trend in most industrialised countries but, alarmingly, Australia's rates are amongst the highest in the world, with just a handful of countries having higher rates. We have seen, sadly, the same alarming trend in countries such as New Zealand, the USA and Canada.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even more disturbing is the fact that these figures perhaps grossly underestimate the reality and the seriousness of the problem. For every suicide that is completed there are many unsuccessful attempts. In fact, there are an estimated 10 admissions to hospital for attempted suicide for each suicide that actually occurs. Also, perhaps many of our motor vehicle accidents involving young people are disguised suicides.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The causes are many and complex and the forum on youth suicide organised by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs certainly highlighted many of those. The speakers&mdash;Dr James Harrison, Professor Kosky, Dr Meg Smith and Associate Professor Pierre Baume&mdash;pointed to a number of contributing factors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important that we look at these contributing factors and the causes not in terms of an academic study, not in terms of an attempt to gain knowledge for its own sake, but in terms of an attempt to come to grips with the causes so that we may better address the issues and develop policies which may help us address this alarming problem in our community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">First of all, they pointed to a range of adverse social conditions about which a number of my colleagues have spoken here this morning. They are factors that seem to be common in those countries that have high youth suicide rates. Those factors include increased and high 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9779"> levels of divorce; high levels of unemployment, especially for males; high levels of unemployment for males when there were high employment levels for young females; declining rates of church membership; and other social changes that seem to be common in those countries where youth suicide rates are high and increasing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They pointed to a number of personal characteristics and situations that contributed alarmingly to the problem, and we have heard much of these this morning, including symptoms of depression and, often, mental illness. Studies show that up to two&hyphen;thirds of the young people who had taken their own lives had had a history of depression and, often, a history that fringed on mental illness as well. Suicide can be related to increased levels of stress for young people: levels of stress arising out of conflict with parents; levels of stress arising out of school work and problems at school; levels of stress related to romantic problems, the breakdown of relationships; and levels of stress related to a significant social upheaval in their lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another factor that was very prominent in the thinking of some of those speakers at the forum was the very high level of alcohol consumption, which seemed to have a high correlation with rates of suicide. Other factors include the weakening of networks of interpersonal support&mdash;no&hyphen;one to turn to when things get tough; interference with help&hyphen;seeking behaviour and delivery of services; a change in the sense of community, with less family support, a lesser role for churches and other organisations that in the past have offered support that is so much needed when a crisis comes; and degrees of marginalisation, particularly for Aborigines and homosexuals, especially in rural and remote areas where the support networks are not available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The speakers also pointed to family problems, to families where there was a strong background of violence or abuse, which was noted in up to 50 per cent of cases of attempted suicide. A history of family discord and low cohesiveness was found by a Queensland study to be a major factor in 70 per cent of suicide cases for young people. Other problems pointed to were the death of a close relative, the separation or divorce of parents and family breakdown. Interestingly, suicide rates were lowest among those who were married and were highest for those who were divorced or separated and for young people who were from families which had experienced divorce or separation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issues of contagion and imitation have been raised here this morning as well. Just a few weeks ago, for instance, in one of our newspapers, we read of the tragic case of five drinking mates from the Southern Highlands township of Bundanoon who, within a period of a couple of weeks, had taken their lives, one after the other. There seems to be evidence that when friends, mates and peers have succumbed to the pressure to take their own lives, this impacts on those who are left behind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of the speakers, and particularly Professor Pierre Baume, made much of the impact of the media, of the focus of the media, of telefiction, of heavy metal subcultures, of the role of the Internet in suicide in young people and the impact that that has on framing their thinking. An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph</EMPHASIS> just last week, in fact, spoke of two 15&hyphen;year&hyphen;old girls who jumped off a bridge. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">After using a felt pen to write of their love for two boys and their devotion to grunge bands Nirvana and silverchair on a wall, two teenage girls held hands and jumped off a footbridge on to a freeway.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">One died the other one survived.The article goes on:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Newcastle band silverchair has a song, Suicidal dream, featuring the line, "I fantasise about my death, I kill myself from holding my breath."</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This sort of portrayal by our supposed entertainers, and by some in the media, certainly has done much to distort the thinking of many of our susceptible young people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, from that forum, we saw that increased pressure, depression, reduced self&hyphen;esteem, decreased ability to cope, and a decreased cause for hope all contributed to the tragic and alarming increase in levels of youth suicide in this country. There is an enormous challenge for us as a government. There is an enormous challenge for us as a community and there is an enormous challenge for us as individuals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, for the government, there is a challenge to put into place policies that reduce some of those background pressures, some of those social factors that may in fact lead young people to think that life is not worth living. We are all aware of the need to tackle the issues of youth unemployment, and both the former government and the current government see that, quite rightly, as a very high priority. We are all aware of the need for government to provide policies of support for families so that the family unit is strengthened and not endangered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to these policies that will change the structure of society and perhaps reduce some of those pressures, there needs to be a much greater emphasis on direct policies of assistance, direct policies to tackle the issue of youth suicide. We saw with the previous government the $13 million budget for the `Here for life' youth suicide prevention initiative&mdash;a very worthwhile initiative. We have seen with the current government a budget of $19 million funding for the national youth suicide prevention strategy. There needs to be much greater attention to these sorts of programs which will help organisations who are working at the coalface with our susceptible young people&mdash;organisations such as Lifeline, Kids Helpline and Youth Insearch.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need services which are accessible, credible, relevant and attractive to young people. We need services which are non&hyphen;judgmental, confidential and free. We need services which are flexible and innovative in their approaches to the needs of service users. We need services which are best practice in the treatment of young people who are depressed or in crisis. We need greater attention to training for educationalists and medical practitioners, who are often the first point of contact for those suffering depression or contemplating suicide. We need greater attention to recognition of early warning signs and to counselling for those under threat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The forum made many recommendations to the government: that a national advisory council be established; that a research advisory committee also be set up; and that immediate attention be given both to educating young people in treating depression and to standardising procedures for hospitals when treating young people presenting with self&hyphen;inflicted harm or attempted suicide. We cannot rely only on the government, though. I believe that ultimately the issue of youth suicide cannot be resolved totally by the government. The former speaker, the member for Parramatta (Mr Ross Cameron) made reference to this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government can really only tinker around the edges, because the incidence of youth suicide is reflective of problems at the very heart of our society and ultimately requires solutions that also go to the heart of our society. It involves restoring those values, ideals, relationships, structures and behaviour patterns which enhance life, raise self&hyphen;esteem and offer hope for our young people. We all have a responsibility here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a role for the media. The media has a responsibility to refrain from pushing ideas and lifestyles that are destructive of moral values, that are destructive of families and that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9781"> diminish the value of life. The media has a responsibility to avoid excessive and often voyeuristic portrayals of incidents of suicide that may lead others to copy them. The media has a responsibility in avoiding airplay of songs which promote or romanticise the idea of suicide. Instead of its hand&hyphen;wringing exercise of sensational journalism and finger&hyphen;pointing, it has a responsibility to share in promoting positive values.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a responsibility for parents to give greater focus to the needs of their children, focusing on the children's needs rather than their own. There is a great responsibility for parents to work at keeping their relationships together. It is perhaps not coincidental that Australia, as well as having one of the highest suicide rates in the world, has one of the highest divorce rates in the world. I am not saying that that is always avoidable: clearly, it is not; but often it is seen as an easy option and an easy way out, regardless of the impact that that has on our children and our young people. We have a responsibility to raise our children in a way which encourages them to look beyond themselves and their own problems, and to consider the problems of others and their relationships of others. We need to raise our children in a way which considers service rather than a desire to be served.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that in the community there is a place for a much greater focus on spiritual values, on issues of meaning and purpose in life. We have taken for granted too much the destructive philosophies of secular humanism, hedonism, existentialism, reductionism and nihilism. It is about time that we started to realise that there is meaning, hope and significance in life and that, unless we address these core spiritual values, ultimately there will always be a degree of frustration&mdash;for our young people as well as for us&mdash;in searching for meaning and purpose in life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe as well that there is a need for society to emphasise again the sanctity of human life, particularly in the face of the assault by a flirtation with euthanasia and a blind acceptance of abortion on demand. If we give on one hand to our young people a very strong message that death is a solution to problems such as pain, that death is a solution to unwanted pregnancies, we can hardly be surprised if this does not have some impact on the way life is regarded and on the way suicide is in fact regarded when things get tough. We cannot keep, as a society, sending mixed messages to our young people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The high and rising levels of youth suicide are a reflection of many underlying maladies in society. There is clearly no easy solution, but they should be sending the alarm bells ringing that all is not well and that the fundamental reordering of values and priorities is needed. These warning signs need to be heeded not only by governments but by all in our community.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suppose I am a reluctant contributor in this debate. In fact, I can say that I kept my name off the speakers list for some time and have only just recently decided to place it on. I can tell you the reason for this, and that is that, out in my part of the world, we have a very high youth suicide rate. In fact, there is one particular church that I am able to help&mdash;I hope not improperly&mdash;in preparing the funeral service notice for the funerals that are held there, and particularly the suicides. It is in this way that I get to know and see some of the tragic results of youth suicide and the impact it has on families and the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Generally speaking, I always say about problems&mdash;I think lots of others approach it the same way&mdash;that we need to break them down into their smallest parts and concentrate on those parts, particularly those within our grasp. I think the first thing that you have to really grasp about youth suicide is that it is a complex problem. If we could merely say that suicides are a result 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9782"> of depression, then it would be relatively easy. We could then go out perhaps and try to identify those that are depressed and high risk and develop some strategies. But suicide is complex.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you combat some problems in my electorate, you find that there are other problems as well. For example, I can well recall&mdash;I am very grateful to the former Minister for Social Security, the member for Sydney (Mr Baldwin), coming out with his officials, and representatives of some other departments&mdash;where, on the ground, we were looking at what was needed to get young people trained up and back into work. We calculated that there were nine different Commonwealth and state departments that we actually needed to coordinate to be able to provide a solution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the great weaknesses of our form of administration is that we compartmentalise things within portfolios. Let me give you another example. On the issue of literacy, an important issue in my electorate, we have the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Dr Kemp) in the House constantly speaking about the issue of illiteracy, saying that it is important. I suspect he is a little short on solutions, but certainly he is lifting up community awareness about literacy. We should have our attention raised, I guess.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, you cannot teach people to read if they have a juvenile justice problem. You cannot teach people to read and be numerate if they are hungry. You cannot teach people to read if they are homeless. You cannot teach people to read if they have other social problems and dysfunctional families. In the quest to solve a literacy problem, you have got to deal with each and every other issue. We are not equipped to do that. Not only is there the break between Commonwealth, state and local government, but how do you coordinate them all?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think this is where, when we are discussing youth suicide, we have to understand that we need to bring a holistic approach to the problem. Let me run through some statistics. In 1995, there were 350 male suicides and 84 young female suicides. The male suicides represent 25 per cent of the male deaths; the young female suicides represent 17 per cent of young female deaths. The first thing I would say is that we need to get better statistics, and we have to listen to young people in particular.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why better statistics? When is a drug overdose really a drug overdose and not a suicide? It is very clear, I guess, if they leave a note behind. When is a car accident merely a function of perhaps too much alcohol or careless or negligent driving, or a suicide? The point I am trying to make here is that I certainly suspect, and others in a better position than I in my electorate suspect, that these statistics are grossly under&hyphen;representative. We may have a much bigger problem than we credit. I was interested to try and get a grab on local suicide figures, and I cannot do that. But what I can say is that, in one parish, among under&hyphen;25s in the years 1987 to 1996, we have had 291 deaths. A significant proportion of those are suicides.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should also put it on record that, although death confronts us all, I think that one of the most difficult things for parents and societies to deal with is the death of young people. I do not believe it ever leaves the parents unscarred. But in our society there is, I guess, no greater feeling of emptiness and frustration than results from young people having got to a point where they have elected to take their own lives. That presents an additional degree of difficulty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs for holding its seminar. The good thing is that it has held a seminar in the parliament and invited a whole variety of people with a range of experience to meet to discuss the problem. I was pleased, as I said, that one of the community groups from my electorate participated. But I say to the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9783"> chairman of the committee that, if all we do in this parliament concerning youth suicide is merely to have this seminar, we will be poorly serving both the young people and the parents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I certainly think that we need to start having the idea that youth are worth investing in&mdash;if we want to talk in economic terms&mdash;and that a life, if we can prevent it from being taken so young, has a whole contribution to make to our local community, to our society, to our nation. We do need more statistics; we are a statistical society and it allows us to focus on and see the dimensions of the problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that some of the solutions are out there already and we need to be working on them. Firstly, the measure of any society is the value the society places on the worth of the individual and the idea that the loss of one individual is a loss too great to bear. I always tend to rattle on about education but, in the area of schools, it is really important to pick up on the problems as early as possible&mdash;for instance, literacy problems. I really find it difficult when people wish to politicise this, when we know very well that the money we invest as a nation in early education&mdash;that is, in infants in years 1 and 2&mdash;is money well spent. It gets them on the reading trail. It is so much cheaper to remedy problems in years 1 and 2 than later in primary school or in junior high school.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have said before in this place that I regret that some of my high schools graduate students in year 10 who are illiterate. They are fully certified as having successfully completed the course, but they are illiterate. It does not mean that they are dumb people; it does not mean that they are less intelligent. But it does mean that they have not had the benefit of all the excitement that comes with being able to read and write. Early intervention requires extra teachers and extra people. It is money well spent; it is a terrific investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the debates on work for the dole, it really upset me to listen to some of the government backbenchers who were suggesting that this single measure was somehow going to favourably impact on youth suicide. I do not think it is. I do not, for one minute, believe that it will. Youth suicide is far too complex. The idea that people should be able to finish their schooling and be gainfully employed is very important. As a society, we are going to have to decide whether we are going to test people as to whether they are employed gainfully, being paid wages and whether they are working in either public or private enterprise. What about those people who can never get a job? There are just not jobs there; the economy is not powering away. We do have a double standard. We are labelling these people in an era of high youth unemployment as failures. I do not think they are failures. I suspect that we are failing them as a society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wanted to speak about the contribution of the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) and his comments about the Child Support Agency and divorce. I got into a lot of hot water when I suggested that people&mdash;not necessarily youth&mdash;were suiciding as a result of their predicament in regard to child support. I was accused of undermining the scheme. I always stand up and report the facts as I know them. Regrettably people do suicide and we need to reform not only the Child Support Agency but also family law&mdash;they are linked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think children have generally the entitlement to access to both parents; and if they do, they immeasurably benefit from it. It would be nice if people did not divorce, but that is not the reality. The idea that the honourable member for McPherson has is that if we have all mothers staying at home to rear a family, this will solve all our social problems. I never deprecate a family where a mother or a parent has elected to take on, full time, that child&hyphen;rearing role. But 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9784"> to go from that to saying that all families should be in this situation is grossly unfair. It pays no heed to the revolution that has occurred for women's role in our society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why shouldn't women be able to aspire to having a relationship, having children, but also having a career? They are no lesser mothers because they aspire to and fulfil those roles, but I think there are too many men in our society who are really captured in old&hyphen;world views and old&hyphen;world thinking, and have not updated themselves to it. As I say, I do not criticise those families where there is a parent at home, full time, raising children. But do not expect that all families will want to make the same choice or, indeed, will have any choice about that. The more we start spending money on live families and relationships, instead of on dead families where the marriage or the relationship has broken down, the better off we will be. We spend $250 million in family law on dead marriages and peanuts on live ones. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) (b) Accurate data as to the cost of engaging a professional to prepare a taxation return for a strata title body corporate is not available, however the taxation returns for this type of taxpayer are generally simple and would not be expected to command high fees. It is noted, also, that the cost of having a recognised professional tax adviser prepare a taxation return is an allowable deduction in the year the cost is incurred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) A tax&hyphen;free threshold is an integral part of the progressive income tax system for personal taxpayers. It serves the objective of vertical equity by ensuring that personal taxpayers who earn low incomes pay little or no income tax, whereas taxpayers on larger incomes pay progressively higher marginal rates of tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The corporate tax system is inherently different from the personal tax system as there is a single tax rate of 36 percent and no tax&hyphen;free threshold. There is, therefore, no reason to treat income earned by a strata title body corporate any differently (by providing a tax free threshold) to income earned by any other business entity. Moreover, introducing a tax&hyphen;free threshold for bodies corporate would provide tax advantages to their members, irrespective of their income levels, and would lead to pressure for a similar tax&hyphen;free threshold from other industries and sectors.

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There has been no lack of co&hyphen;operation between State and Federal governments in the introduction of the new standards for residential aged care facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The development of standards is a Commonwealth responsibility. The new standards were developed in close partnership between representatives from consumer groups, aged care industry associations, unions and the Government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new Residential Care Standards were introduced from 1 October 1997 (Quality of Care Principles 1997, Schedule 3). Aged care facilities will be assessed against these standards until such time as they seek accreditation during a three year transition period from January 1998 to January 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9791"> 2001. Facilities seeking accreditation from January 1998 will be assessed against the Accreditation Standards (Quality of Care Principles 1997, Schedule 2).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both the Residential Care Standards and Accreditation Standards require service providers to identify and comply with all relevant Commonwealth, State and Territory legislation, regulatory requirements, professional standards and guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">My predecessor, the Hon J. Moylan MP, wrote to State and Territory Health and Community Services Ministers on 24 September 1997 concerning the implications of State and Territory health and related regulations for Commonwealth funded facilities. Mrs Moylan sought agreement to a protocol for the regulation of hostels, to operate for a two year period, to enable a review of existing Commonwealth and State health regulations applying to aged care hostels. The proposed protocol reflects an approach agreed by Commonwealth and State officials to clarify similar issues in relation to building requirements under the Building Code of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Building Codes Board, in conjunction with State building authorities, has also commenced a review of the classification of residential aged care buildings. The objective is to ensure that the Code licensing requirements can accommodate the development of integrated aged care facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am confident that the States and Territories will, as they have done to date on other aspects of the reforms, co&hyphen;operate in arriving at a sensible approach that will give certainty to providers and maximise the potential of the aged care reforms to achieve improvements without compromising the quality of care.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">What are the details of royalties and other payments paid to Aboriginal groups each year in respect of mining in the Northern Territory.</PARA></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="9791" SPEAKER="Wooldridge, Dr Michael, MP" NAMEID="8E4" ELECTORATE="Chisholm" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Health and Family Services" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8E4">Dr Wooldridge</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The payment of royalties to Aboriginal people in respect of mining on Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory is a matter for private negotiation between the mining companies and the Aboriginal people concerned. I am not privy to those arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976, the Commonwealth makes payments from the Consolidated Revenue Fund to the Aboriginals Benefit Trust Account equivalent to royalties paid by mining companies to the Northern Territory Government in respect of non&hyphen;uranium mining interests in Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory. In the case of uranium mining interests in Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory, the mining company pays a royalty of 5.5% to the Commonwealth and the Commonwealth makes payments from the Consolidated Revenue Fund to the Aboriginals Benefit Trust Account equivalent to a royalty of 4.25%.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of the monies paid into the Aboriginals Benefit Trust Account, 40% is paid to Aboriginal Land Councils in the Northern Territory to cover their costs of administration and 30% is paid to relevant Land Councils for distribution to Aboriginal organisations in areas affected by mining. The remaining amounts are paid to incorporated bodies and groups of Aboriginal people as grants, used to supplement the administrative expenses of Land Councils or invested as accretions to the Trust Account's accumulated fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Annual reports of the Aboriginals Benefit Trust Account are tabled in Parliament, and contain details of the Trust Account's income and expenditure. The following table shows the royalty equivalent income and expenditure of the Trust Account from its inception on 1 July 1978 to 30 June 1997. The expenditure figures reflect both statutory royalty equivalent income and other income.</PARA>
