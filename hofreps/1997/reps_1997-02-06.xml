<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At a time when the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) is critical of the pay increases achieved by a number of Australians through bargaining with their employers, in particular the Transport Workers Union in Victoria, there is a group of Australians whose pay increases abound seemingly unchecked. I am speaking about senior executives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government does not seem to pay as much attention to the massive increases achieved in executive salaries as it does to the modest pay increases of ordinary Australians. Indeed, the Minister for Industrial Relations is quoted as saying that with the new decentralised system executive salaries are no longer the problem they once were. Yet there can be no clearer demonstration of the destructive power of unregulated capitalism than the obscene amounts of money that are paid in executive salaries. Regrettably, governments of all persuasions have been either unwilling or unable to control executive salaries. For example, during the wages freeze of the early 1980s, when the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) was last Treasurer, executive salaries rose by 14 per cent. At the National Economic Summit Conference, after the Hawke government was elected, there was enough concern about uncontrolled executive salaries that a call for restraint was included in the communique.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Throughout the life of the Hawke government, when ordinary wage and salary earners contributed so much to national recovery and reconstruction, there were attempts to bring executive salaries under control, but without success. In 1988, for example, the then Minister for Industrial Relations, Ralph Willis, called a summit on executive salaries but was unable to get the main players to accept that executive salaries should be controlled in any way other than by the market.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="292">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the 10 years between 1983 and 1993 award wages increased by 53 per cent, and average weekly earnings went up by 74 per cent, as did inflation. Over the same period, executive pay increased by 133 per cent. According to a recent article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Independent Monthly</EMPHASIS> in the past year, salaries paid to the executives of the top 150 companies increased by six to eight per cent&mdash;10 to 15 per cent if you include the cheap share deals and bonuses that have become a common practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The latest survey of executive salaries by Cullen Egan Dell has shown that senior management remuneration increased by 6.3 per cent last year. This increase is well above price increases of one per cent that the consumer price index registers and the 4.5 per cent upper limit of pay increases regarded as acceptable to maintain low inflation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us not forget we are talking about large increases upon already extremely large salaries. An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Independent Monthly</EMPHASIS> magazine in June estimates that there are 45 senior executives in Australia who earn more than $1 million. There are many more who would earn well in excess of half a million. In 1993&hyphen;94 there were 13 Victorian executives who earned more than $1 million and 44 who earned between $500,000 and $1 million. I dare say that none of them live in my electorate, the electorate of Scullin. When you consider that someone like the CEO of Westfield Holdings earns an estimated $72,000 a week, it is sobering to look at the average taxable income in a seat like Scullin. The mean average taxable income in Thomastown in 1993&hyphen;94 was $24,700; in Lalor it was $24,041.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said at the outset, there is no clearer example of the destructiveness of the market than its failure in relation to executive salaries. One cannot pretend that executives are worth these obscene sums or that it has anything to do with performance. Over a number of years we have seen celebrated examples of the opposite. There is the case in 1989&hyphen;90 when Elders IXL increased its executive remuneration packages by 23 per cent at the same time as there was an 80 per cent drop in operating profit. Then there is the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> case of Adsteam, in the same year. This company's chief executive had a 53 per cent pay increase at the same time as the value of the company shrunk to eight per cent of its former worth on the Australian Stock Exchange. As the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Independent Monthly</EMPHASIS> revealed in another example, MIM Holdings' share price was `on its way to the cellar' when its chairman retired with a payout of over $2 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there is the celebrated case of the soon to be unemployed CEO of Coles Myer, Peter Bartels. Despite Mr Bartels' spectacular salary package of $2.8 million, the performance of Coles Myer under his leadership has been spectacularly questionable. The annual report shows that Mr Bartels' salary package jumped by 75 per cent in 1995&hyphen;96 while the company's profits plunged by about a third to $280 million. It was reported on Monday that, as part of his exit package from Coles Myer, Mr Bartels received 200,000 Coles Myer shares valued at $1 million. This was in spite of the fact that he was not due to receive the package if he ceased employment with Coles Myer before November 1998 `with the exception of certain circumstances'. I think the Australian public would like to know what the circumstances were that have now allowed this payment. Perhaps it was the one&hyphen;third plunge in profits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Independent Monthly</EMPHASIS> points out, performance is no guide to executive salary. It cites the example of the highly successful retailer Woolworths, which pays its CEO $665,000, which ranks him 95th out of the top 100. In recent months there has been another celebrated case of an individual being paid a fabulous sum when on any assessment his performance, based on the performance of the company that he leads, is not worth one&hyphen;tenth of it. I am speaking of Mr Ross Wilson, Managing Director of Tabcorp. By any standards Mr Wilson is paid a king's ransom&mdash;or, more precisely, a Premier's ransom&mdash;to run Victoria's Tabcorp. As an <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> commentator flippantly put it, Mr Wilson's salary package is roughly twice the GDP of Tasmania. Mr Wilson was paid initially $675,000, in 1993&hyphen;94, plus an interest free loan of $6.75 million to buy shares in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="293"> Tabcorp. His salary has increased to just over $1 million. The shares bought at $2 each are now worth $5.20&mdash;an appreciation of nearly $10 million. The dividend is being used to pay off the interest free loan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question is: does this sort of level of remuneration have anything to do with the capacity to perform? Given the farce that occurred last Melbourne Cup day throughout Victoria, the answer is clearly no. On the most important day of racing, Tabcorp failed in its most elemental function: to provide a facility for people to put a bet on. In my electorate and in shopping centres across Victoria, queues snaked their way across car parks with thousands of punters waiting to place a bet on the cup. Malfunctions in Tabcorp's computer put services on hold for about three hours on the most important day of racing. Ordinary Victorians, who in their lifetimes will never earn as much as Mr Wilson does in one year, stood and waited to put their couple of dollars on the Cup. Mr Wilson, of course, was not affected. He was with the glitterati at Flemington, able to bet on course.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The big losers were TAB agents, small business people, who ultimately pay Mr Wilson's fabulous salary. They are estimated to have lost millions. Because of the crash, takings at agencies were down by about 10 per cent based on last year. But what was Mr Wilson's reaction? A sort of grudging half-apology, hardly what one might expect from someone who gets paid so much to ensure that the system runs smoothly. Initially, Mr Wilson would hear nothing of compensation for the small business people who make up Tabcorp's network of agents, but he has thought better of it. It must be said that the performance of Tabcorp is not a good ad for privatisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where does the buck stop? Should Mr Wilson's salary package be reviewed? Even the Victorian Treasurer is reported to have admitted that the Wilson package has been his biggest mistake. There is no mechanism to stop similar packages arising. As former Senator John Button said recently, the problem about large executive salaries in this 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> country is that the executives themselves `are not good enough to justify them'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the Prime Minister, and the Treasurer (Mr Costello), have sounded off against executive salary increases in recent times, what are they going to do about it? What they have just done is secure the passage of measures that have the potential to reintroduce market anarchy into the method of fixing the wages and salaries of ordinary Australians, a fact already being bemoaned by the Minister for Industrial Relations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly there is a need to have an inquiry into executive salaries involving, at least in part, an old&hyphen;fashioned work value case. It is high time that the same sort of productivity tests that have been applied to the wages of ordinary Australians over the last decade and a half are also applied to the top executives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One measure that the government should consider is the introduction of an upper limit similar to that introduced by President Clinton in the United States in 1993. This upper limit applies to the collection of corporate tax. Effectively, it removes the deductibility of executive salaries above the limit of $1 million. While some are critical of its effectiveness, it is an important symbol in pushing executive salaries towards performance based compensation. In other words, the government should be saying, `What is considered to be a reasonable level of executive remuneration? If you want to pay your executives more, do not expect the taxpayer to subsidise it by allowing it to be deducted as a cost of production.' <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="293"><TITLE>Automotive Industry&mdash;Tariffs</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the last election the coalition had the prime goals of helping families, creating jobs and encouraging small businesses. The success of the motor vehicle industry in Boothby's industrial heart will be central to achieving those three goals locally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Productivity Commission has been asked by the Treasurer to report by May of this year on assistance to the Australian automobile industry from January 2000. The Productivity Commission's draft report, released last year on 20 December, has 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="294"> produced a majority opinion which proposes the reduction of tariffs to 5 per cent by the year 2000. With its main assembly plant in Tonsley Park in my electorate of Boothby, Mitsubishi supplies just over 10 per cent of the domestic car market. That makes it the smallest producer of the four Australian producers and, due to the consequent economies of scale, it is the highest cost producer of the four Australian manufacturers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recognise quite well that a tariff is a very inefficient form of protection in terms of the increasing of domestic prices and also in the way that it can contract output. But I feel that the commission's majority report has neglected to factor in the regional impact that the continuing lowering of tariffs will have on the South Australian economy. I am not a big supporter of tariffs. As I said before, tariffs are an inefficient form of protection, but this is a problem that we have inherited from the old days of the tariff board and it is a problem that I have inherited to some extent as the member for Boothby.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My deep concern is that a further reduction in protection immediately post-2000 at the same pace&mdash;that is, 2.5 per cent as we have seen happen over the last decade&mdash;may lead to the closure of Mitsubishi's Australian operations and to a possible flow&hyphen;on effect to the component suppliers. For example, in my electorate we have Henderson's&hyphen;Automotive and Munro and just outside my electorate we have Britax Rainsfords, all of whom supply component parts to Mitsubishi. I recognise that members of parliament do not come into the House to represent companies, but they do represent their employees. At the end of last year Mitsubishi Motors Australia employed 5,188 people and of those 1,605 reside in my electorate of Boothby. If you consider the possibility that Mitsubishi Motors may close its Australian operations, then that would have a flow-on effect which goes much further than those 1,600 people. It would have a multiplier effect on services, energy and also on the component suppliers, many of whom are clustered around that central part of my electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">South Australia is still recovering from the mismanagement during the 1980s of the State 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Bank. That was a heavy blow to a regional economy and the disinvestment of one of the car producers would be a further blow. Of course the car industry provides a considerable amount of the gross state product. Automotive manufacturing is responsible for something like one&hyphen;sixth of South Australia's gross state product. It is responsible for one-third of its exports. It is enormously important to the state of South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard)&mdash;as he has said publicly and also privately&mdash;is well aware of the regional impact that any downturn in the automotive industry would have on South Australia. My concern is that an immediate move to 5 per cent tariffs, if that were to mean the closure of Mitsubishi's Australian operations, would devastate the region south of the city . I know that they are not crying wolf if they hint that they are going to pull out of Australia if the majority report is implemented. No-one thought that Nissan would go, but they have gone. Australia has gone from five to four car producers. That point should be recognised by the commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that a freeze in tariffs post-2000 is not unreasonable, or that a smaller decrease than 2.5 per cent would not be unreasonable. But the automotive industry needs to be well aware that that does not mean any letting up of the competition. That would mean that they still need to continue to find those productivity improvements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have always supported the Button plan. I believe that it has provided a tremendous improvement in productivity in the automotive industry. We should recognise that the gains as the car industry has been opened up to international competition in productivity have been quite outstanding. But before lowering tariffs into the next millennium, Australia still needs further improvements of efficiency in the tax system, the labour market and the energy and transport sectors. For example, at present passenger motor vehicles have a wholesale sales tax of 22 per cent; services which compete for the consumer dollar do not. In addition we need to continue with trade liberalisation and to improve overseas access for Australian exports, though 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="295"> I recognise that that should not be used as a bargaining chip for the further lowering of tariffs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of best views from my office can be seen by looking out of the window at the large semi-trailers conveying the new Mitsubishi sedans into Marion Road from Alawoona Avenue. They drive past on their way to the docks. That was part of a contract that Mitsubishi won two years ago which enables them to supply 20,000 of their Magna and Diamante cars to every market outside Japan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just recently, Mitsubishi Motors Australia broke into the Taiwan market, selling something like 2,000 cars in Taiwan. That is a first for Australian cars. So we should recognise that there has been an enormous change in the work practices of the automotive industry as it has striven to compete in the international market place. For example, increasing use is being made by Mitsubishi of robotics, something which Japan has led the world in to allow Japan to compete with low wage countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">South Australia, with only one&hyphen;twelfth of Australia's population, contributes something like one-third of Australia's automotive industry. A submission from I think the South Australian Development Council shows that they have developed the South Australian model, SAM, to factor in what the effect of tariffs will be. That was used in conjunction with the national Murphy model 2, MM2, to calculate what effect tariffs would have on South Australia's economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That model calculates that, from 1996 to 2000, as tariffs go from 25 per cent to 15 per cent, there will be an output loss of 2.2 per cent in manufacturing, a 1.6 per cent output loss in electricity, gas and water, and a 1.5 per cent output loss in recreation and personal services. That contraction in output is largely due to lower automotive industry prices which lead to lower output and employment in the car industry and in South Australia as a whole. It will also lead to about a 1.3 per cent decrease in employment in South Australia. This is made up predominantly of a 2.6 per cent loss in manufacturing, a two per cent loss in electricity, gas and water and a 1.5 per 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cent decrease in wholesale and retail trade, transport and communications. That will mean an increase in long-term unemployment of 0.3 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, if you factor in continuing tariff decreases from the year 2000 to 2004, the employment loss in South Australia increases. It virtually doubles to 2.71 per cent, and it means that unemployment will be about half a per cent higher at the end of the next decade than it otherwise would have been. More importantly, real private consumption will decrease by 3.2 per cent, and there will be a 2.5 per cent loss in South Australia's working population due to migration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The same national model shows an overall increase in real national GDP of the order of 0.1 per cent. So it is important to note that, for a small national gain, South Australia bears the greatest brunt of exposing the automotive industry to international competition. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="295"><TITLE>Legal Aid</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, in your earlier contribution you discussed the preoccupation of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) with wage increases for transport workers in this country. That essentially came from what we were told was, in theory, the government's aim. A crucial part of those negotiations was the negotiation and discussions about penalty rates on Saturday. It is part of the kind of deal that this government supposedly endorses. You made the distinction that we do not see too much concern, too much interest or too much activity by the Minister for Industrial Relations regarding the massive growth of executive salaries in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another issue in the melting pot at the moment which goes to inequity and the drive by this government to basically stratify this society is that of legal aid. In the last few days the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> has concentrated very substantially on one particular aspect of this issue. A person facing charges for drug related matters might have to be released because of his inability to obtain legal aid, as a result of this government's 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="296"> efforts. That is only one aspect but it is probably the most controversial and most worrying one for some people in middle Australia. This question of legal aid and this government's determination to basically deprive large numbers of Australians of the ability to represent themselves in our judicial system has many other implications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know whether my electorate is different, but I have had the most correspondence on this particular matter rather than some of the other controversial issues that we have seen. This correspondence comes from a wide range of organisations, two of which I am pleased to say are centred in my electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first group is the Vietnam veterans. I recently had the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) telling me how good they were while he was out backslapping, unveiling plaques and running around the office. I think they are a bit more concerned with the repercussions of this government's attack on legal aid and the impact that it will have on the ability of people who fought for this country&mdash;many of whom were conscripted&mdash;to fight issues such as the impact of defoliants, pensions, disability services, et cetera. In letters they have written to me they were very critical about what they see as a major attack on ex-servicemen in this country through this drive by the government on legal aid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second group is the Women's Legal Resources Centre. I am pleased to say that I helped them to obtain premises in my electorate when I was a state member. They have written expressing their very grave worries about the impact of these changes on women. Amongst their comments to me in a letter of 11 November was this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed cuts breached the Coalition Government's pre election promises to maintain funding to legal aid, to match and extend Labor's access to justice measures and to redress imbalances which disadvantage women in the legal system.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They go on to note:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over 30,000 women apply for domestic violence restraining orders in Australia each year and about 60% of these women have dependent children.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They say quite clearly that those people will particularly suffer from this government's 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> fairly draconian attack on legal aid. They further state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Only in the most limited circumstances is aid available for family law property disputes. Women who are excluded from the family home with no assets are not able to obtain their share of the family assets to which they are entitled to receive because they have no money to afford to take their matter to court.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Women's Legal Resources Centre also point out that we are going to have a wide variety of repercussions and by-products. For example, women will be forced into refuges because it will not be viable to fight their cases for their homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is running around the place with some excuse that, since 1973, when Commonwealth legal aid was introduced, there has supposedly been an avoidance of responsibility by state governments and that the federal government should take on this matter in a very aggressive fashion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that 55 per cent of legal aid funding in this country does come from the federal sphere, and this heavy-handed attempt to supposedly solve the disparity in the way it is funded has led to a grave undermining of the system. There is always a very difficult balance in deciding what is a state and what is a federal responsibility in regard to legal aid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The situation is that the government has said that over the next three years it will slash a massive $120 million out of this system. This is a system which at the moment people are questioning. It is means testing. People are saying at the moment that large numbers of people cannot get representation; they do not get a chance to fight their cases against companies and they do not get their opportunity to have legal rights in this country because they cannot afford it. Even under the previous system we had this problem. One really has to have grave worries about where this whole thing is going to go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another group that has been in contact with members of this parliament is the Australian section of the International Commission of Jurists. It is very timely this week, with the variety of meetings that are being held in the national capital in connection with Jose 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="297"> Ramos Horta, the Nobel Peace Prize recipient, to put on the record that organisation's very strong support for the Timorese cause. But on the particular matter at hand, they said that their organisation:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . regrets the decision of the Federal Government to reduce funding the legal aid system by more than $100 million over three years . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The organisation is concerned:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that the reduction in funds will reduce the rights and ability of the financially and socially disadvantaged people to get access to justice, the right of accused people to a fair trial and consequently Australia's ability to perform its international human rights obligations.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So as I say, there was a wide variety of organisations&mdash;there was a national coalition meeting on this issue which included everyone from Care Australia, the Salvation Army, the Uniting Church and the Bar Council, all of these organisations&mdash;coming together and saying, `This government's decision, this minister's decision to attack legal aid and people's ability to have their day in court, is an extremely serious change in this country.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For instance, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Legal Aid News</EMPHASIS> of December 1996, covering the work of the legal aid organisation, gives some indication of just how broad the matters they tackle are. This is not just the example given by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of a drug dealer being unable to defend himself and therefore on the verge of being released. It covers an extremely diverse range of issues, and it really gives you some indication of why we must have a strong legal aid intervention in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amongst the issues that the Legal Aid Commission took up in the month before that last journal was issued were the rights of elderly people in a nursing home who had paid large amounts of money to enter that institution to resist a very extreme increase in weekly costs and charges on them; child support advice; and the conduct of an insurance seminar for citizens to get abreast of insurance law and make them aware of some of the traps in that field. A domestic violence conference was conducted by the legal aid institution. They took on the New South Wales state government in regard to tenancy agreements. That action was of such a consequence that the New South Wales govern 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment, the department, had to alter its tenancy agreements because of the matters raised by the legal aid team.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They also exposed in court, and fought for a large number of people who were exploited by, a migration scam&mdash;an issue that is of great concern to me. These people had paid as much as $30,000 to a character or group of characters who were supposedly going to get them permanent residence and did not have one chance in 20 million of accomplishing that. But once again, this is an indication of just how many people are affected by this attack being made by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also another case in that journal of a woman's ability to get 50 per cent of an estate in a property settlement; again, she was defended by legal aid. Another case that month&mdash;and, as I say, this diversity of activity occurred in the course of only four to six weeks&mdash;was based upon a police admission of perjury and fabrication of evidence, a person being released as a result of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, this government's attack on legal aid is a very serious attack on broad, middle Australia and people's ability to have their day in court, their ability to fight for their rights. I urge reconsideration of this matter. These people should not suffer because of the minister's preoccupation with technicalities about whether this is a state or federal responsibility, because there are many people being deprived of their rights through this measure.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="297"><TITLE>Compulsory Voting</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in the chamber this morning to support the principle of voluntary voting. At a time when we are discussing having a people's convention and there has been some speculation over the voting system that the government will adopt, those who support compulsory voting have come forward once again to urge that as a nation we should not only give people the right to vote but also compel them to vote&mdash;even in a situation where, if they fail to vote, some of them will end up in gaol.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's likely decision to have voluntary voting in the election of delegates to the people's convention is not to be taken 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="298"> as a precedent with respect to the advance of voluntary voting in other areas&mdash;and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has made that clear. But I must say that I find it very difficult to understand how in a democracy those opposite and some other people on our side of politics could seriously argue that not only should someone have the right to vote but that one ought to compel people to vote as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A very large number of people at election time might feel that they are prepared to support one party or the other. But there is also a substantial minority of Australians who feel that politicians are not worth voting for; they might not want to vote for either side. Of course, most of those people do vote under the threat of a fine or imprisonment; that is why they go to the ballot box. I believe that one must reasonably wonder about the quality of voting that those people cast.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most of us have been at polling booths at 6 o'clock, just before the polling booths close, and we find people who wander in on their way from having a very pleasant liquid afternoon; sometimes it would only be 300 metres to the polling booth, but those people might take 600 metres to get there. Those people in a close election are the people who, in fact, could be determining which side of the political spectrum will form the government of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Honourable members opposite would be aware that, in the 1993 election, had about 1,000 people scattered across a number of marginal seats voted differently, the government would have been changed and Paul Keating would have been thrown out and John Hewson would have become Prime Minister. What I am saying is that, in a democracy, it is very important that we, at an election time, get the government that the country deserves, the government that the country wants, the government that has the right policies to make sure that the country has future progress. But we now have a situation where an election could well be decided by a minority whose only interest in casting a vote is simply to avoid a fine or simply to avoid the sanctions currently in the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Electoral Act, which are at times quite draconian.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that, if Australia is to support democratic principles and individual civil liberties, compulsory voting must be abolished, as its existence constitutes a denial of individual rights which we all hold so dear in Australia. On the Sunshine Coast we have had people who have been threatened with imprisonment because they did not vote at the last federal election. If one listens to the proponents of compulsory voting, one would almost believe that those who support voluntary voting, as I do, are somehow opposing democracy. It is almost as though voluntary voting would be a novelty. It is almost as though voluntary voting is not something that happens in many other parts of the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many people in our community are not aware that voluntary voting was abolished for federal elections only in 1924, when a National Party senator, Senator Payne, brought in a private member's bill. No leader of either side of parliament actually participated in the debate, which slipped through the parliament in just a few hours. Senator Nick Minchin, in an article he has written, points out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Payne had a genuine concern about political apathy and felt the solution lay in compelling Australians to take a keener interest in the welfare of their country.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Senator Minchin also points out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At one stage in his second reading speech Senator Payne said: `If the amendment of the electoral laws, which I am submitting, is enacted, it will be found that in a short time there will be a wonderful improvement in the political knowledge of the people.'</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What an incredible statement. In the years that have passed since 1924, I do not think any serious person could suggest that there has been a wondrous improvement in the political knowledge of the people, and surveys have been taken.

The simple fact of the matter is that, had 1,000 people across the country changed their votes at that poll, the government would have changed. But we have a situation where people are forced to vote; and, of course, the reason that many of those people vote is to avoid a fine rather than to cast a serious vote in the interests of choosing the party which is best able to deliver good government.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A Saulwick survey in 1994 found that year 11 students who were soon to vote were `profoundly ignorant' of our system of government and how it works and that many had only a rudimentary knowledge of how the system of government works. In New Zealand, the closest example to Australia in culture and history, where enrolment is compulsory but voting is not, voter turnout at recent elections has been 88 per cent; in Germany, where they have voluntary voting, 87 per cent; in France 79 per cent; in Great Britain 77 per cent; and in Canada 75 per cent. All of those great democracies have voluntary voting, and one can see that the percentage of people who turn out to vote in a voluntary election is not very far short of the percentage of people who turn out to vote in Australian elections.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The point that I want to make to the honourable member for Reid is that people in those countries are prepared to come forward and do their civic duty. They vote because they want to vote for one party or the other party. What we have in this country is a situation where a substantial number of people vote simply because they have to. I think it is better to have a government elected on a slightly smaller percentage of the Australian vote, if that percentage is a considered percentage. This is an issue that should transcend party politics. After all, surely we are interested in good government in this country and surely those opposite can also see that it is important to have voluntary voting.</PARA></TALK.START>

The bottom line is that most in the Liberal Party&mdash;I know there are some exceptions, like one Petro Georgiou&mdash;believe that there is an advantage to them in abolishing compulsory voting.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I move to the issue I wish to raise today. I am very disappointed that the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) has exited the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> chamber. She should be here to hear what I have to say as this is an issue that she should be taking a very strong interest in. I refer to the Allandale Nursing Home in my home town of Cessnock. I have raised this issue in the House on two occasions, and I will continue to raise it until I get some satisfaction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Allandale Nursing Home is state government owned and controlled. In its heyday it contained more than 400 nursing home beds. The state government in collaboration with the federal government&mdash;both past and present, I am happy to add&mdash;is transferring many of those nursing home beds to other homes in the geographical area covered by the Hunter Area Health Service. Sixty beds have already been transferred and it is the intention of the Hunter Area Health Service to transfer some 100 more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bed transfers are about addressing the maldistribution of beds in the area covered by the health service. I am the first to recognise that there is not an equitable distribution of nursing home beds in the area covered by the service. But what neither government has been prepared to recognise is that there are some fairly disastrous employment implications as a result of those transfers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sad to say that Cessnock does have a higher rate of unemployment than the national level. It certainly cannot afford to lose a large slice of one of its major employers. Allandale Nursing Home is large enough to justify the economies of scale necessary to have its own laundry, kitchen, cleaning staff and tradesmen. Indeed, the nursing home traditionally has been the trainer of nurses and the first point of call for those school leavers seeking an apprenticeship. It will have disastrous implications for employment in the Cessnock area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the very least, I am pleased to say that the state Minister for Health, Andrew Refshauge, has agreed to postpone the transfer of the next 100 beds until the issue has been given the opportunity to be more widely canvassed. A number of public meetings have been held on the Allandale issue. It has been a very difficult issue for state member Stan Neilly and me because we recognise that there is an inequitable distribution of nursing home 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="301"> beds in the area covered by the Hunter Area Health Service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When attending those meetings full of very angry people concerned about job prospects and full of many elderly people concerned about their access to aged care services, we have tried to allay their fears. We have taken a responsible  approach, have attempted to explain the maldistribution of beds in the area and, at the same time, have worked very hard to ensure that further transfers are deferred until such time as proper plans are in place to replace those jobs that will be lost as a result of bed transfers at Allandale.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, you can imagine that some of those meetings have been quite angry. It would have been very easy for me to simply say, `Yes, this is an absolute disgrace. There is no justification for the transfers whatsoever.' That would have been easy. But for me as the member for Hunter, and for Stan Neilly as the state member, it would not have been the responsible thing for us to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You can imagine my disappointment when at a public meeting held in February 1996, attended by hundreds of people, the then National Party candidate for the seat of Hunter, one Michael Johnsen, attended the meeting and announced to all and sundry that he had consulted the then shadow minister for health, the now Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge), and had gained a commitment from Dr Wooldridge that, if a coalition was elected, nothing would change at Allandale. `Everything would remain the same at Allandale,' Michael Johnsen assured the hundreds of angry people at Allandale in February last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have with me the media release issued by Michael Johnsen at the time. It is entitled `Coalition support for Allandale'. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The Coalition supports the retention of the Allandale Nursing Home," said Coalition candidate for Hunter, Michael Johnsen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The issue of aged care in Cessnock has been of concern for quite some time and people can feel secure in the knowledge that a Coalition government will continue to support Allandale as long as there is a need."</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It goes on:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Clearly the need is there and is expected to actually increase over time as the community continues to age."</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Johnsen gave the commitment at a public meeting over the issue held at Allandale Nursing Home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Aged care is not an issue that should be played with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The Coalition supports and actively encourages the increased use of such a facility in Cessnock."</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Staff at Allandale can also feel secure in knowing that a Coalition government will support the service they provide, so vitally important to our elderly citizens," Mr Johnsen said.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The first thing I did when I was elected to the federal parliament was write to Dr Wooldridge. First I congratulated him on his appointment to the ministry, but then I asked him to honour the commitment to Allandale made by Mr Johnsen prior to the election. My letter, not surprisingly, has never been responded to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, alas, my surprises do not cease there. This week I picked up the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Maitland Mercury</EMPHASIS> where the Allandale Hospital is the issue again. This time the headline is `Dungog missing out on nursing home beds'. This was a story created by the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin), who has in his electorate the township of Dungog, which happens to have a nursing home&mdash;like so many others&mdash;a little short on nursing home beds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the member for Paterson wants the bed transfers from Allandale accelerated in order to shore up nursing homes in his own electorate. I wish I had time to read some quotes from the article, but what he basically says is that Dr Refshauge's decision to delay further transfers&mdash;at our request&mdash;is causing nursing homes in his electorate to miss out on vital services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suggest to the member for Paterson that he honour the commitment given by his party prior to the election. If the member for Paterson wants additional nursing home beds in his electorate&mdash;it is very simple&mdash;he should convince his government of the need for more nursing home beds, not the need to transfer from one area to another.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to speak today about water storage in the Burnett River catchment and about the need for a more pro&hyphen;active stance on water conservation in this country. I recognise that two factors have lead to the downgrading of water conservation as an issue over the last decade or so. The first is that economic rationalists would have us believe that every water project should be justified not only by cost benefit and broad economic data but also by the user&hyphen;pays principle applying to funding for each and every scheme. The second revolves around the greater appreciation of environmental issues concerning river flows, salt and the potential damage to flora, fauna and marine environments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sadly, some have misrepresented the latter, forcing both sides of the water conservation debate into entrenched positions. Even more sadly, working through the issues to determine the regional and national interest becomes the last rather than the first item on the agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Time and time again we go through periods of horrendous drought only to be followed by raging floods. I do not want to sound simplistic, but we have seen in the last week this huge expanse of water going through the community in Charleville and you cannot help but think that, as a nation, we could harness and husband the resources in a more appropriate way. I recognise that there are some very fragile ecosystems, such as the Cooper Basin, and I for one would oppose the dam that is being proposed on that watercourse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, in our economic rationalism and at times our extreme absolutism in conservation, I think we have lost the vision of greening this vast, dry country. If, as the rhetoric says, we are going to become the `salad bowl' of Asia, if the supermarket to Asia is to fulfil its potential, then we must become a much more professional and consultative community in the managing of our resources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I warmly welcome the concept of a national water audit. I applaud studies into recycling, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> trickle and drip irrigation, trash blanketing and other moisture retention methods, urban conservation education, studies into salt intrusion and a host of other sensible measures. But even these depreciate in their true value if we do not tackle the need for strategically positioned major water storages. The fact that mistakes were made in the past over irrigation&mdash;excessive clearing, insufficient river flows and the like&mdash;is not an excuse for turning away in this generation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To give us some idea of how essential this is in regional Australia, the Queensland government, through its Queensland Water Infrastructure Task Force, called for submissions for a 15-year program envisaging an outlay of $1 billion on water type projects. Would you believe that at this stage they have received bids in excess of $7 billion? One billion was their figure and $7 billion the figure for the bids. I think this illustrates just how quickly we need to address this matter of supplying water to regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I vigorously support the government's $1.1 billion environmental package and the establishment of the water audit. This will give us the opportunity to establish world's best practice in these areas. If the Telstra sale is highly successful&mdash;and I trust it will be&mdash;I would like to see the vision extended further. I strongly advocate a national infrastructure fund of at least $1 billion running parallel with the better knowledge flowing from the water audit and armed with better environmental practices which will flow from the $1.1 billion scheme for the environment. This way, Australia could enhance its productive capacity immeasurably and in an environmentally sensitive way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite apart from all this, there is an urgent need to enhance and consolidate rural and regional Australia. We cannot treat the bush in the next decade with the neglect that was experienced in the last decade. We can and should have assistance schemes of various types in times of crisis, but there is no substitute for a vote of confidence in the bush to replace years of denuding with a new vision of tangible enhancements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the western edge of my electorate, the Dawson Valley scheme is currently under 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="303"> active consideration by the state government. I want today not so much to promote the scheme but to illustrate what it can achieve. That particular scheme, which envisages a major dam in the headwaters of the Dawson River, will trigger two coal mines, a power station, an extension of the rail line from Taroom to Theodore, linking two rail systems, double or even treble cotton production in the Dawson Valley and make that valley virtually drought free. That is the sort of vision we need to be looking at.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to talk so much about this scheme, but one in my own electorate&mdash;the Bundaberg irrigation scheme; one which actually was preceded by the Burnett&hyphen;Kolan scheme and rejected by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics in the mid-1960s. The Burnett-Kolan scheme, which was the forerunner of the Bundaberg scheme, was a remake of that particular enterprise. It was suggested to the federal government and the state government in 1969. Sir John McEwen backed it very heavily and it commenced in 1970, with the completion of the Monduran dam, a major water storage approximately 1.1 times the size than Sydney Harbour, and was completed in 1974.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The whole scheme was completed in 1992. It was a very big scheme, stretching over 20 years. It is a system of weirs, channels, piping, and river based and underground irrigation. It has enhanced my area immeasurably over that period. For example, the area under cane production went from 38,000 hectares to 47,500 hectares, small crops went from 2,000 hectares to 4,000 hectares and tree crops went from 200 to 4,000 hectares. It is arguably the most intensive irrigation scheme in Australia. It supports sugar production of $240 million and small crop production of $100 million. That is a third of a billion dollars just from those two cropping areas. When we also bear in mind that that represents 600,000 tonnes of  sugar and that we export nearly 85 per cent of that to an international market, it is also very much an export earning crop for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The original scheme envisaged a second storage at Kalliwa. Kalliwa is about 40 to 50 kilometres south-west of Bundaberg. I would 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> like to promote in this parliament today the idea of a study into that dam as soon as possible. It is a $150 million scheme and it will contain 1.85 million megalitres of water, delivering 400,000 megalitres per year. Just to put that into perspective, the current allocation from the existing scheme, Lake Monduran, in Bundaberg, and the various associated weirs, is 259,000 megalitres, but the demand is 440,000 megalitres. You can see that there is a vast capacity already for the utilisation of water.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To put this into layman's terms&mdash;you might ask me what that will mean in terms of production in your area&mdash;it would mean that sugar would increase 30 per cent in terms of vertical integration&mdash;that is, the existing sugar growing areas&mdash;and horizontally by 35 per cent by the inclusion of a further 13,000 hectares. It would mean less salt intrusion and it would mean doubling of small crop and tree production from 4,000 hectares to 8,000 hectares. That is quite significant; it is quite a major scheme.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this grievance debate today to speak on two issues I believe must be addressed by the government as a matter of priority. They are not issues just confined to my electorate of Moore, but widespread. They affect thousands of Australians and are the source at present of enormous frustration and anger directed against the government. The first is in relation to telephone towers. I wish to speak today on the serious public concern and frustration that is growing across Australia in relation to the almost willy-nilly erection of mobile telephone towers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that many members on the government side are aware of the strength and size of these concerns throughout their electorates. Yet I am amazed at the lack of progress achieved by this government&mdash;that is coming on top of what the previous government did&mdash;so far. I know that the national telecommuni 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="304"> cations code was the creation of the previous Labor government. Of course, a previous Labor minister initiated a national review in 1994 and then did not act until December 1995, and then only basically to make a promise to change things if that government was re&hyphen;elected. This government has conducted its own review and acted, but what they are offering is a case of too little, too late.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 21 November last year I asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts, the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith), to inform the House as to why telecommunications carriers can build towers and roll out cable just about wherever they want to, often against the wishes of the local communities affected. The answer I received foreshadowed Minister Alston's review and subsequent announcements to affect telephone towers but promised some hope at the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me refer to a specific case in point in my electorate. I have been closely involved with residents in the northern suburbs of Perth and the Wanneroo City Council in trying to establish sensible controls over the siting of mobile telephone towers. In the Mindarie&hyphen;Ocean Reef area, Optus had sought to establish a tower immediately adjacent to a local private school. I represented the residents association to Optus, requesting that an alternative site be utilised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did not ever contend that the tower should not be built in the area, but rather that the location was unsuitable and that alternative sites were available&mdash;in parts of public open space and the Tamala Park refuse centre site, well away from residential habitation or schools. Optus took the view that these sites were technically inferior and, since they were not obliged to comply with council or residents' recommendations, the school site was where the tower would go. Why were these residents concerned? They are not troglodytes opposed to the progress of technology. Rather they have genuine concerns about possible health risks related to locating these transmitters close to schools or residential property while doubts exist about them.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dr Peter French, a respected cell biologist from St Vincent's Hospital, said on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> that he had found:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . when we expose cells to a mobile phone frequency that the cells alter their cell shape, they increase their rate of cell growth and also they change their secretory properties.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The changes that we are talking about are very important. They relate to very important basic cell functions and, therefore, there is a need to be aware of this and, therefore, to approach the use of mobile phones with some caution.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">His research is not unique in its findings. Telstra acknowledge that there are pockets of research which show there are questions and more work to be done but that there is no evidence to show that radiation from the phone is unsafe. Their advice reminds me of recent denials by tobacco companies before US Congressional hearings where vested financial interests still manages to deny health risks associated with another lifestyle habit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister announced his review on 3 December 1996. He went further to announce the details&mdash;one of which might compel carriers to co&hyphen;locate transmission sites&mdash;on 23 December, with them to come into effect on 1 January 1997. Optus acted to erect its tower immediately after this announcement and before the new code came into effect. This school at Mindarie now has a previously extant Telstra tower behind it and an Optus tower beside it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that many members own and use mobile phones and will recognise that signal strength is often a problem. Not in this school: the transmission power reading blasts to full constantly 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Fortunately, the children are there only five days a week and of course only during school terms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that some people have been content to say that we have no proven risks of these transmissions, but if we want to introduce a new drug or food or medical device that might irradiate the body one must first prove its safety, not rely on the public to prove its dangers before it can be approved for use. I ask the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr McGauran) to stand up in this House and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="305"> personally vouch to the safety of these devices to the electorate. If not, why are we allowing unfettered siting of these telecommunication towers? What will the liability be to the Commonwealth if we do not act to protect the public in the absence of proof of safety?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another aspect to this problem. These companies have been granted powers that give them enormous financial advantage and distort market economics. All other businesses must comply with planning requirements by council or state authorities. These carriers are able to ignore councils and they ignore such requirements, and successive governments have allowed the situation to continue. I contend that these companies are being allowed to operate outside the government's own competition policy by virtue of their favoured status, which I believe must be remedied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is clear to me that the regime relating to the siting of telecommunication towers has more to do with the sale of Telstra than it has to do with anything else. In fact, one does not have to be an absolute genius to work out that, in the absence of this unfettered ability to site telecommunication towers wherever they want to, the realisable asset value of a telecommunications carrier would be diminished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to point out that the school I used in my illustration is a non&hyphen;government school where parents pay fees for the education of their children. This school operates as a small business in the marketplace, competing for the delivery of its educational services. I am advised that the parents are now making arrangements to remove their children from the school and find other educational arrangements because of the uncertainty as to the safety of mobile telephone towers. Here we have another instance where the lack of a forthright approach to competition policy is affecting another small business&mdash;in this case, a non-government school.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">The proposed amendment to standing order 226 results from a recommendation of the Procedure Committee last year. I want to place on record the government's thanks to the committee for the work that it has done. In respect of three of the technical changes, the government has also had the advice of the Clerk of the House. I also want to record our thanks for his advice on those matters. As a preliminary comment, we have also had discussions and briefed the opposition party on the proposals. I understand that generally they are supportive of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Standing order 226 sets out the order in which bills should be considered in the consideration in detail stage. For new bills the order remains the same as always, that is, clauses first separately, then any schedules and other matter such as the title or preamble. For bills which amend other acts, the amendment changes the order to allow the House to consider first the schedules, considering each item in the schedules separately, if it wishes, then the clauses and other matter. This reflects a change in the format of these bills. They now contain the substantive amendments in the schedules rather than in the clauses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee felt that the House's capacity to examine amending legislation and members' traditional right to debate and vote on amendments separately should be upheld. The government concurs in this view and has proposed this amendment to enshrine the right of members to deal with issues individually when they are contained in schedules, just as they have always been able to do in respect of issues contained in clauses. Of course, the House, by leave, will still be able to consider schedules as a whole or the entire bill as a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> whole in the same way as it does with new bills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment to the standing order also provides that consecutive items within a schedule which amend the same section of an act will be considered together. In essence, the amendment provides that the items within the schedules of amending bills are dealt with in the same way as the clauses of bills traditionally have been and still will be for new bills. In a nutshell, the amendment to the standing orders simply reflects the fact that the manner of drafting of legislation as it comes before the House has changed. We are simply changing the standing orders to meet that fact. We have relied on close examination of the issues by the Procedure Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are four other technical amendments which are proposed for the House's consideration. They are machinery amendments and come as a result of the advice that we have had. In respect of standing orders 65, 68 and 232, these amendments are intended to clarify the application of certain rules of debate which apply during the consideration in detail stage of bills to the consideration of Senate amendments and requests. These rules are the ability to speak more than once &mdash;standing orders 65 and 68&mdash;and the waiver of the requirement for a seconder, which is standing order 232. The amendments do reflect the current practice and I do not believe, therefore, that they contain any matter of controversy or contention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of standing order 86, `Matters not open to debate', this amendment removes a reference to cognate debates which is no longer meaningful since the omission of standing order 217C on 1 May 1996 and the return to informal arrangements for cognate debates which currently apply. As I said, we have had consultation on these matters with the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Crean). I would hope that these amendments have the support of all members of the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just looking forward very briefly, we have also had some discussions with the opposition parties on another matter with regard to the standing orders. That relates to the conduct of the counting of divisions. We have some ongoing discussions about that. I would be 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="307"> happy to brief the Independent members on those discussions. We, essentially, are looking forward to a proposition of picking up some parts of the Procedure Committee report in respect of consecutive divisions and to  adopt a proposal of an extra couple of counters on the government side for the first division so as to reduce the time involved in counting. Again, on those matters we will continue to consult. I commend the motion to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will not repeat today the comments made earlier by the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin) as to how the former government repeatedly deceived the Australian people during the election campaign. We all know that they left us with a $10 billion black hole. As the Treasurer (Mr Costello) said in his budget speech, `We could not stand back and ignore the problem. Although we did not create it, we will take the responsibility to fix it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill will ensure that the Australian people are never again deceived in such a dreadful way. Political parties will not be able to get away with saying that they cannot keep their promises because they did not know how bad the nation's books were. In this bill such problems are addressed, and I believe it will go a long way to restoring some of the faith that the Australian people have lost in members of this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian people will know the full account of the nation's books before they go to the polls and cast their votes accordingly in future. The charter of budget honesty shows this government's strong commitment to responsible and accountable government. Indeed, we need to rebuild trust in government after the previous Labor government's deceit. Our Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has said that, to build trust in government, we must start with economic honesty where people can have an honest account of the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> state of the nation's finances and the plans the government has for the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is a practical gesture towards the broader goal of rebuilding confidence in the annual accounting process and, indeed, in government itself. The Charter of Budget Honesty Bill will focus on three important areas: firstly, it will clearly separate the recurrent and capital sides of the budget; secondly, it will establish benchmarks against which fiscal policies can be assessed; and, thirdly, it will seek to achieve prudent public debt levels and the more appropriate balance between operating revenue and operating expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The need for such arrangements has already been supported by the National Commission of Audit and the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. All of what I have said may sound slightly technical, but it basically means telling the truth to the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last week the Treasurer announced the mid-year economic and fiscal outlook prepared in accordance with the charter of budget honesty, although this legislation has not yet been enacted. This review provides updated information on the forward estimates and economic outlook and includes information never before reported on fiscal risks and contingent liabilities. The outlook also contains a statement of risks, which sets out a comprehensive list of factors that could impact on the government's fiscal position. These factors include policy reviews under way, possible Senate rejection of the budget measures, litigation and contingent liabilities. As the Treasurer noted, the statement of risk represents the first time an Australian government has completed a list of such factors and represents a milestone in the improved disclosure of information by governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very proud to be able to speak on this bill today. I am also very proud to be a member of a government which made a commitment to more honesty in government and is now delivering it. The strategy adopted in this bill will allow this government when next going to the polls to look voters in the eye and say, `Here are our commitments and here is how we are going to pay for them,' in the full knowledge that we can indeed pay for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="309"> them. There will be no mysterious deficits, no need for smoke and mirrors and no excuses for not being able to fill our promises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Previously speakers from the opposite side of the House seem to have mysteriously forgotten that it was they who conveniently neglected to tell us that the books showed that the nation was in deficit. How could they have campaigned telling people that the books were okay, that they had done a good job and that things were as good as they were ever going to get? Thankfully, the Australian people did not listen to Labor and threw them out of office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since being elected as the member for Canning, I have had many people write or phone me and just stop me in the streets to tell me what a good job they think John Howard and the government are doing, particularly after the budget was delivered. Some members opposite said yesterday that we deceived the Australian people. But I can tell them that that is not how the people see it. They see Labor's $10 billion deficit and they know we have to clean it up. People know we just cannot keep on borrowing forever and a day and send the bill to some mysterious tomorrow. They voted for us because they were sick and tired of irresponsible financial management. One constituent recently wrote to me and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">May I take this opportunity to say how impressed I am by the integrity you and your government are contributing towards the federal politics of our country and to wish you every success in your efforts to overcome the problems in so many areas that were handed to you by the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think that just about sums it up. When I receive letters such as that, I know that we are on the right track. I applaud the Treasurer for introducing this Charter of Budget Honesty Bill and I commend it to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first thing I would like to say about the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill 1996 before the House is, `Thank goodness it's finally here. Thank goodness the government has now decided to do something about it.' It means that once this debate is finally out of the way we on this side of the House will not have to listen to the government members go 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> on about their so-called charter of budget honesty as if they were the most virtuous bunch of politicians ever to occupy the government benches, as if they were the first to ever initiate any sort of regime of fiscal disclosure, as if Labor had not put in the hard yards on budget transparency years before them while in government and which they have now used as the springboard for this piece of legislation we are debating today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On its charter of budget honesty, I believe for too long this government has played the errant schoolboy, bragging to his mates about his Saturday night exploits until everyone has started thinking that he is all talk and no action. The government has talked about it, bragged about it and spent a little bit more time boasting about it, but it never really did anything about it. We were beginning to wonder. I for one am glad it is here because, as I said, I am frankly sick to death of hearing about it. I am glad it is here because it gives those of us on the opposition side participating in the debate an opportunity to refute some of the garbage, smears and innuendo we have heard spewing from the government benches concerning Labor's term in office and our own level of budgetary honesty. It also provides us with an opportunity to offer some constructive criticism of the bill in the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question of a charter of budget honesty raises some interesting issues. It is a matter worthy of some serious and thoughtful debate&mdash;something which some critics would say is not a frequent occurrence in this chamber. It is certainly something that we have not been hearing from the majority of government members during this debate on this bill. Rather than focus on the inner workings of the bill, rather than take a closer look at what the charter actually hopes to achieve and whether it will do its job properly in its present state, the crux of their argument has been little more than an unwise and unwarranted attack on the previous government's record. I would have liked to have spent my entire 20 minutes concentrating on the former, but I cannot let the latter go unaddressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last election campaign featured a concerted effort by the coalition to discredit 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="310"> Labor over what it unjustly portrayed as an attempt to deceive the Australian people by refusing to provide forward estimates for revenue and the budget during the campaign&mdash;opening up the books, so to speak. It was an election, and all is fair in love and war, but the arguments we presented in government were sound then and they are sound now, and we do not resile from them a year later. In fact&mdash;and this is a point that our friends on the other side might like to try to forget&mdash;our arguments were so sound they were even used by the current Prime Minister (Mr Howard) 13 years beforehand. I would like to jog the memories of the government members now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did the member for Bennelong have to say as Treasurer in 1983 when he was questioned by journalists as to whether he intended opening up the books to provide a `guesstimate', based on a set of wobbly numbers from the Treasury department, of the next financial year's budget deficit? Let me quote him directly from a press conference that he gave on 21 February 1983. Admittedly he was only Treasurer then and he is now Prime Minister, but he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I can't put it more firmly than some estimates because the nature of calculating these things is such that you really don't know until much closer to the event precisely where revenue and expenditure are going to go . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let me point out that this time last year when the Government got its first look at the likely shape of the 1982/83 budget it appeared on the basis of calculations then that our deficit position would be a great deal better than what it ultimately turned out to be and the estimates of revenue which made certain assumptions about wages growth and certain assumptions about activity growth were much more buoyant. I genuinely believe that it's impossible to go hard on the size of next year's deficit . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This was a message he repeated time and time again during this period. On 8 April 1983, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>  reported that Mr Howard&mdash;then Treasurer of this country, the member for Bennelong&mdash;speaking on ABC radio warned `that the forward projections were unreliable as in the space of only a few months there could be substantial changes in both the economic outlook and the budget situation'. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Yet he and those speakers on the government side deny the same right of explanation to us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I dredge up the past solely for the purpose of teaching some of our newer members on the government side and some of their more experienced colleagues, who should know better, that it always pays to tell the truth. In relation to their attempt to besmirch the Labor Party's record on providing full and complete budget honesty, they have not been telling the truth. If they had been telling the truth, they would have admitted that Labor in government followed established practice in not releasing forward estimates for revenue or the budget in the middle of a financial year&mdash;a practice laid down by our predecessors and followed by our current Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government members wish to try to tarnish our record in this regard and attack our reasonable refusal during the election campaign to gaze into that economic crystal ball for their own cheap political benefit, they should remember they are attacking the actions and justifications of their own leader in the process. As for the Prime Minister's attempts to castigate and crucify Labor on this matter, just as it will forevermore, his past comes back to haunt him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us have by all means a charter of budget honesty. Let us see if we can make things even more transparent and open without the pitfalls, but let us not have any of the hypocrisy from the Prime Minister, the Treasurer (Mr Costello) or any of the other government members. Let us not have them criticising the former government's actions when they themselves were quite prepared to use that same explanation when last in office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe Labor has a proud history of promoting budget transparency, which is second to none in this country. Early in our previous period in office we introduced forward estimates for outlays for three years ahead of the budget year. Later on we introduced forward estimates of revenue, which meant we also initiated forward estimates of the budget outcome. These estimates were updated at budget time every year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was Labor that introduced the mid-year review of the budget. It was Labor that published the annual tax expenditure state 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="311"> ment, significantly improved budget papers and attached financial impact statements to all explanatory material for new legislation with the aim of facilitating a clearer public understanding of the budget process. No other government in our history ever made such a concerted effort to provide the Australian people with the same degree of budget information as the former Labor government. That is not fantasy; that is fact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So let us have no more of the absolute claptrap about how this government is the first to ever think of making the budget process more transparent. The charter of budget honesty could be a step in the right direction, but it is a step following many taken by us between 1983 and 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to make one final point before I turn to the bill itself. I am not a masochist, but in one respect I take great joy in hearing the government members crowing about this bill. I enjoy it because to me it is a sign of the hubris which is already starting to spread through the government's ranks, eating its away along its benches, starting at the front and working its way to the back. The Prime Minister has tried so hard in advising his pack of young and inexperienced charges to avoid such pitfalls, but I encourage them to do go on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is so proud of this bill and the levels of honesty which it supposedly represents that it thinks it can ignore the fact that the road behind it, not yet even 12 months long, is littered with its broken promises, examples of its dishonesty, and its wholesale betrayal of the Australian public in relation to its discarded election commitments. The longer the hubris does go on, the longer the members opposite ignore their budget dishonesty and try to stake the high moral ground, puffing themselves up with the same sort of self-important pride we see in the Treasurer whenever he enters this House, the sooner the Australian public will become wise to their act and the sooner they will send this government packing&mdash;and I, for one, certainly am all in favour of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Forget budget honesty for a moment; let us talk about budget dishonesty. How many budget promises have the government now 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> broken? How many election commitments have they transgressed? I will tell the House: $17 billion worth of broken promises at last count, and the government is only 11 months old.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When in opposition you said that you would not touch universities. You set about them with a carving knife. I think the promise was `to maintain the level of Commonwealth funding to universities in terms of operating grants'. Now, following the cuts announced both before and in the budget, $2 billion will be cut from universities over the next four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You also said you would not touch child care, yet you set about it with a sledgehammer. The promises here, if my memory serves me correctly, involved maintaining a non-means tested child-care cash rebate, maintaining the system of child-care assistance and maintaining operational subsidies. None of these commitments have been kept.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government also said they would maintain the social security safety net, and then they got out the scissors, breaking promises regarding everything from the earnings credit scheme to rent assistance. I could go on and on but I merely want to remind members opposite of what they have to be proud about when it comes to their so-called budget honesty. The answer, of course, is a big, fat zero.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us now turn to the make-up of the charter itself. As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) has already stated on our behalf, we support the government in introducing its charter of budget honesty, but this support is qualified by a number of amendments being made to this bill to make it substantially tighter. In my own opinion, perhaps the biggest hole in the bill is found in clause 3(2), which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nothing in the Charter of Budget Honesty creates rights or duties that are enforceable in judicial or other proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is interesting, isn't it? We can pass this bill, the government can carry on with all of its hoopla and circuses about how wonderful it is and how concerned it is with financial probity and honesty, but if&mdash;heaven forbid&mdash;it chooses not to live up to the demands it is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="312"> placing on itself, if it chooses not to meet all the requirements laid down by this bill, then there is nothing to be done, through either the courts or any administrative appeals tribunal, to force the publication of any of its financial and budgetary reports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is to be done? Do we merely take the government at its word when it promises to disclose the relevant information? Let me answer that with another question: if we are now in the fashion of taking political parties at their word, why did the government need to introduce the Flags Amendment Bill last year? Both of the major parties plus, if I remember correctly, the minor parties in the Senate all stated quite publicly and without reservation that they would not involve themselves in any change of the flag which did not involve a direct vote by the Australian people. Yet these words were not good enough for the government. They legislated to ensure that no party could break their word in the future, which brings us back to the charter. If we did not take the word of politicians six months ago, what has changed now?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government wants to be consistent, if it wants to raise the bar that much higher or, perhaps more importantly, if it wants the Australian public to really believe it means business with this charter, the legislation should be amended, in my opinion, so as to allow judicial force to ensure the publication of all of the relevant budgetary and financial reports, including pre-election reports and policy costings. Anything less, I think, can be read as a lack of determination on the government's part to provide the strongest legislation possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This brings us to another flaw in the bill. The previous hole could perhaps, if we were charitable, be put down to legislative oversight. It often happens when bills are being prepared. Yet the bill's faults as they relate to pre-election reports and policy costings, especially as applied to the opposition, appear less of an innocent mistake and more of a sly attempt to slip one through under the noses of the public and the present opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have here is the equivalent of a legislative hidey hole which really portrays the coalition as being more concerned about 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> keeping power come the next election than about being genuinely open about the nation's budgetary position. For example, if the bill were passed in its current state, costings of opposition policies could be undertaken only at the discretion of the Prime Minister, and there is no provision in this bill before the House to obligate the Prime Minister to initiate such costings. Quite obviously, this is an unbalanced and unacceptable situation which is clearly advantageous to the incumbent government. Just as I would suggest that an amendment needs to be made to the legislation which would allow the judicial enforcement of the government to release its budgetary forecasts, I also think there should be an amendment which obliges the Prime Minister to refer any request for the costings of promises by the Leader of the Opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another inadequacy of the bill is that it seeks to allow only the costings of previously announced opposition policies. This would result in a situation where policy decisions would have to be made on the basis of incomplete information and be announced irrespective of the costs. Again this is a situation which may be to the government's advantage but which really cripples the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me turn elsewhere. What about the failure of the bill to provide for a forecast of national savings? If there is one subject which the Prime Minister and his Treasurer like to lecture this parliament about it is the importance of national savings, yet here we are faced with this great watermark of the Howard government's first term in office and there is nothing in it which refers to national savings. Again I ask the question: why?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had the Prime Minister and the Treasurer congratulate themselves on their Commission of Audit, yet in some respects this bill provides for even less accountability than that recommended by the same commission. Again I question: why? We had Mr Costello in opposition demand of the Labor government that the economic forecasts in the 1995&hyphen;96 budget be prepared without any political intervention and that they were to be certified by the Secretary to the Treasury. Yet the government has now only deemed this arrangement necessary for the pre&hyphen;election 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="313"> statement&mdash;not the budget nor the mid&hyphen;year review. Why the change of heart? Why is the Treasurer not prepared to submit himself to the same level of honesty that he demanded of us when he was in opposition?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These failures reflect&mdash;or more to the point cast serious doubts&mdash;on the government's own desire to provide complete and honest details about its financial management. It all smacks of that sinner's old line, `Oh Lord, make me pure, but not just yet.' A line which I know is a favourite of the Treasurer. It shines a new light on all the rhetoric, does it not? The government talks the talk, but when it comes to walking the walk they are all a little bit more reluctant; they are a little bit more backward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is using the smoke and the mirrors to make itself look like it is the knight on the white charger when it comes to budget honesty. But really when you take all that away the government is looking a bit like Don Quixote stretched out on his exhausted horse. As the member for Canberra (Mr McMullan) mentioned earlier in his speech in this House, if you strip away the rhetoric and the hyperbole, what you have is a modest bill. I would go one step further and say that not only is it a modest bill but in its current state it is a flawed bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and all of those harping government speakers we have already heard in this debate want to actually back up their words now with some real action, and if they want to do more than just fool the Australian people into thinking that they are introducing a watertight system of budget honesty, they would take our suggested amendments on board and make some radical changes. Until they do, this bill in its present form&mdash;even though we support the intent&mdash;deserves little more than our criticism of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not commend the bill in its present form to the House. I believe we should sit down, redraft it, include those areas of concern which have been raised and allow those amendments to be made. What we will then have is a genuine piece of legislation that will meet the commitments and rhetoric given during the campaign. More importantly, it 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> will be a piece of legislation that will stand up to all courts.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In her presentation on the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill, the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) reminded me of the old Labor adage&mdash;and I might not have it completely right&mdash;that you never apologise, never resign and never admit you were wrong. I would like to test that against recent history. Notwithstanding her protestations, the reality of the last election and the budget figures was that those figures were available to the now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) as Minister for Finance. They were available to the then Prime Minister, Mr Keating, and that was proven by the fact that they were published by the current Treasurer (Mr Costello) within days of our achieving office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality was that we were not talking about some projections or anything else. The figures were there. It is clear that the leaders of the government at the time could not have failed to have been aware of the situation. They were pressed throughout the election and of course declined to comment. That is what this bill is about. I remind the member for Prospect that, as I am advised, the bill also requires the secretaries to the Treasury and Department of Finance to release a pre&hyphen;election report that will provide updated fiscal and economic projections. In addition, the bill requires that the secretaries to the Treasury and Department of Finance cost and publicly release the fiscal impact of announced election commitments as requested by the government or the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what the bill is about. It is giving an independent responsibility to public servants to advise the Australian people and is consequently putting that sort of obligation on politicians. I am advised that the charter will require governments to outline how they will reverse stimulatory fiscal measures adopted to dampen an economic downturn. This will improve fiscal discipline by ensuring that governments are committed to unwinding fiscal stimulus measures later in the economic cycle, and I want to return to that point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Initially I want to quote a bit of history. We are talking about fiscal management. I ask 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="314"> you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to consider the history of those years when Australia was almost entirely managed at state and federal level by the Labor Party. I can start with my state of Western Australia and WA Inc. WA Inc. was about such funny little deals as buying a petrochemical project that was not even in the advanced planning stages and, as far as I can establish, whose total asset was a block of land which had been bought from the government for very little money. The Labor government of Western Australia under a Premier called Dowding bought it for $450 million. Then, surprise, surprise, the partners had to share it out in the form of $350 million to equal partners and $100 million for the other. They bought blue sky. I can still hear that Premier saying on the radio, `This is a great opportunity for Western Australia.' If it was, why not take the block next door and start from scratch for $10 million? We know why. The $350 million was needed to bail out Rothwells Bank which owed all its money to the trade union movement and the Catholic church.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there was the bailout of Robert Holmes a Court. The state government insurance commission had net assets of $64 million and paid him $800 million for assets that were eventually disposed of after, no doubt, the huge addition of interest charges for $400 million. If we aggregate those two bits of economic management, we find they are equal to the proceeds that the Court government got by selling the then State Bank, which we knew as the R&amp;I and is now called Bankwest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I approve of the privatisation of the bank, but I am devastated to think that all we got out of the sale was the repayment of the debts associated&mdash;and not all the debts associated if we add interest&mdash;with those two agreements. The lady who now sits on the opposition front bench in her former role as Premier borrowed $1,000 million a year to fund such activities as repainting our schools. That was the level of economic management that we had in Western Australia&mdash;corrupt, dishonest and incapable management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we cross the border into South Australia. What did we achieve there? The South 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australian economy was devastated because of the Bannon era. If he put as much time into checking the books of the State Bank as he did jogging, South Australians might have a future. There is a huge task facing that state. I sincerely hope that some of these forthcoming resource projects might drag them out of the economic morass that they were delivered under Bannon and his Labor colleagues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us cross the border into Victoria. You know what we used to say about Victoria? What is the capital of Victoria&mdash;$2? That is where they were under Cain and Kirner. I made the passing remark when they had that strike on the trams, because they were probably the last remaining people in the world to employ tram conductors. I have been to a lot of Third World countries where they learnt not to do so. The workers went and welded the trams to the rails. They thought that was a protest. I said, `No, it was to stop their Japanese owners repossessing them.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The response of Cain and Kirner to massive losses in public transport was to sell off the assets to pay the debt. In fact, it was to pay the wages, which is worse because they created the debt which I understand was costing something like $800 million a year to service. It had nothing to do with achieving the efficiencies of privatisation. Just go and find some money anywhere&mdash;debt led recoverers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have said&mdash;and I think it was pretty right&mdash;that their public transport system under their administration was losing so much money that it would have been cheaper to buy all regular commuters one motor car each and let them drive to work. That was the cost. You cannot do that. I find in the press today that under a Liberal administration Victoria have a $2.4 billion surplus in their budget. Yes, it was substantially achieved by asset sales. When people raise this question of asset sales and the fact that public assets are going off, I remind them that technically they were all sold under Labor. They were so heavily mortgaged in the commercial sense that they had to be sold to put the economies of our states back on a reasonable footing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can keep going around the states. For a large part of that period, there was a coalition 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="315"> administration in New South Wales. Interestingly, with a Labor administration there now I read in the paper today that their first-ever budget has blown out already. It is in very bad shape.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us cross the border into Queensland. Whatever you thought of him, old Joh left them with so much money in hollow logs that it was not funny. Mr Goss went through two terms of office clearing every one of those hollow logs out to the extent of sequestering the real estate industry's privately established malpractice fund of about $160 million. They took it into government revenues, spent it and gave the people of Queensland a government guarantee. In other words, the next time&mdash;and we hope it never happens again&mdash;that a major real estate crash occurs, the taxpayers of Queensland will pay the bill. That industry had provided for itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we get to Canberra. We just heard the member for Prospect talk about `bringing home the bacon'. You can remember all the rhetoric about these brilliant budgets, but, when you rule off the economic bottom line at the defeat of the Hawke-Keating Labor government regime, you find that the debts of the Australian government&mdash;not the nation but the Australian government&mdash;grew in that period from about $20 billion to $100 billion. During that process public debt interest, as identified in the budget, reached about $10,000 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The spokesperson from the other side who is in the House at the moment, the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), who speaks of her concerns about child care should make a few simple comparisons as to where the money is going. We spent $11,000 million on education and we inherited $10,000 million in interest. We spend less than $10,000 million on defence. She ought to stop and think about why that happens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In replying the other day to some people who wrote to me about education, I raised the issue of Medicare. I know how popular Medicare is, but I want to remind the House of what it is doing to expenditures in other areas.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. The cuckoo is Medicare; the cuckoos are the people who dreamt up a scheme that is now taking nearly 20 per cent of the federal budget and delivering less by way of services than was ever achieved and supplied under past arrangements&mdash;the queues, the people in the corridors, twice the money for half the output. In economic terms that is a disaster. That is the achievement of the previous government. The bottom line is $80,000 million of additional debt. I have referred to it over the years as a policy of `Let the children pay'. It cannot go on. I have drawn it to the attention of people, and senior economists say to me, `Well, there's not really that relationship.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the reality is that government deficits under Labor, expressed as a percentage of GDP, nearly every year equated to economic growth in Australia. We got all this garbage about, `Oh, of course, we don't affect the foreign debt,' which, of course, at the end of their regime stood at about $200,000 million. They borrowed an additional $80,000 million out of domestic markets, admittedly, but they have the gall, if not the stupidity, to stand up here and believe everything they say. I think this is one of their great problems. I think the member for Prospect actually believed everything she said&mdash;`It wasn't our fault. Don't blame us. You did it before us.' Two wrongs always make a right in Labor's view&mdash;as long as they can find something we did, even if they have to go back to Billy Hughes when he was a Liberal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that they stood up in this place and said that, if a government of Australia extracts an additional $80,000 million from domestic savings, it does not have an effect on our international debt. If at this moment $80,000 million rained into this room 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="316"> and the Treasurer picked it up, took it back and paid off the people who have lent us that money initially in the domestic market, does anyone suggest that our international debt would not fall by $80,000 million? Of course it would, if only because the savings were back here to be borrowed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When they sold their paper on the domestic market they did not even know who bought it. I can remember reading articles where waiters, restaurant workers of Singapore were buying Australian government paper. To sustain that level of borrowing we had to pay very high interest rates for it. The Singapore workers knew all about it; they could not do better with their money anywhere else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that every dollar borrowed has to be serviced by way of interest and debt repayment. Any government that pursues that policy does it with callous disregard for future generations. They must pay it back. Unfortunately, that payback will not always materialise in higher taxation or those sorts of charges. It will frequently materialise in lower living standards as the economy is unable to deliver to the people because of a rapacious government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You can have any level of public services you like, provided you have the guts to charge the public that demands or thinks they need them. When you provide those services through uneconomic procedures&mdash;in other words, you do not use the most efficient means of providing them&mdash;there is a massive waste of money in getting them to the people who need them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am quite happy to stand up here and identify examples of that, including our funding of Aboriginal people. We have a budget line item of $1.3 billion and that&mdash;apparently after years, almost decades&mdash;has been unable to raise housing standards and health standards of remote area people. Why? Because a large proportion of it goes off to Canberra where there is no Aboriginal problem. That is just a simple example. I have given the effect that Medicare has had on all other levels of services. It is the cuckoo chick in the nest, and it will go on killing off the others, including the area of concern of the shadow minister. If you are going to put large 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> amounts of money in that area, then you will take it away from somewhere else. That is a test for the Australian people. This document is starting to address those issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me just touch on my major area of concern in all of this. There is a need for budget honesty and for political honesty. But, more importantly, that responsibility in many regards resides with both government and opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In opposition, the coalition first proposed the issue of privatisation. When the government eventually became converted to it because of its fiscal woes&mdash;not its philosophical understanding or its appreciation of the efficiencies that might be achieved just because it was going broke&mdash;did we stand up and deny our position? No, we supported the government. It was never an issue for the Senate. Of course, when it got to places like the Commonwealth Bank, it was the then Prime Minister's saviour in his own caucus. Had we wanted to be mischievous on that issue, it just would have got blown out of the Labor Party's own areas. We stood on those issues. Why? Because we believed that they were in the national interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It did not matter what the Labor Party stood for in government. In opposition, it stands for one thing and one thing only: political opportunism. We saw time wasted this morning on the most specious of issues&mdash;as though it would matter whether somebody was told before or after Christmas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The realities are that we now have some very pressing issues confronting the Australian people. One of those comes back to this budget honesty, that is, our tax policy. It is clear&mdash;and it has been proven in a previous election&mdash;that, if people want to go out there and run a scare campaign on taxation, they will always succeed. But God save the economy, God save the ability of a government to properly service those in need when all its revenue options are cut off because of an outdated tax system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why can't the members of the opposition recognise that and say, `We have a bigger obligation than our own re&hyphen;election'? Why can't we try to get together, which will be the only solution, and come up with a sensible 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="317"> tax system&mdash;not one that damages people? Why can't we get together and identify the best system and identify the difficulties that must be overcome in implementing it? Just give the Australian people a hand. The spokesman on Aboriginal affairs is still running around saying that we do not have to do anything serious about the Native Title Act, another invention of his party which is now a proven disaster with regard to the possibility of people getting jobs and the growth we need. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The problem with this Charter of Budget Honesty Bill is that it does not go far enough. Any bill that purports to introduce a new charter of budget honesty, in my view, would need to include a commitment to describe the impact of changes in the budget on the living standards and the lives of all Australians. Of course, this bill does no such thing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is impossible not to be overwhelmed by a deep sense of irony when attempting to couple this government's budget with the concept of `honesty'. We have a Prime Minister (Mr Howard) who, before the election, repeatedly stressed that he would look after the weak and the vulnerable; that, whatever happened, they would not suffer. He wanted Australians to feel `relaxed and comfortable' and he was for traditional families. But now, as Prime Minister, he has to live up to and be judged against these promises. And these are promises that we have already seen broken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the first place, we have what I would have to say is a ludicrous attempt to define degrees of honesty. We have promises that may or may not have to be kept, as expediency dictates, and then we have core promises. Core promises are what apparently this government really believes in and what the government really stands behind. One of the most fundamental of these core promises was the commitment to families. This was supposed to be delivered via the family tax initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But one thing that this government does not seem to understand is that Australian families are not the same in the 1990s as they were in the 1950s. Today we have a large number of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> single parent families. We have a great increase in the number of families where both parents work and we have a number of families where older children remain at home and are dependent for a much longer period as they seek higher and higher levels of education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But does the Prime Minister's core promise of the family tax initiative work equally and fairly for all types of Australian families? Does the budget work equitably and fairly for all types of Australian families? One thing that you would not be able to find from this budget is the answer to those questions. The second thing is that this bill will not require coming budgets to honestly compare the impact of the changes in the budgets and the cuts that we are apparently about to get in the coming budget. We will not be able to tell what the impact on different types of Australian families is going to be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In January this year we saw a study commissioned by the Australian Council of Social Service which does give us a detailed appraisal of the impact of the budget on families. It is this sort of analysis that should be included in the federal budget so that everybody can understand who are the losers from the government's budget cuts. This bill should require the next Costello budget to tell us who the winners and losers are. We do not see any mention of that in this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The study that I referred to was commissioned by the Australian Council of Social Service and conducted by the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research and the National Institute of Economic and Industry Research. What that study clearly showed is that the budget was not beneficial for most Australian families and, in fact, in clear contradiction of the Prime Minister's promise to look after the poor and vulnerable. It says that it:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">had a particularly negative impact on the poorest households . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The study found that, when the impact of the Budget measures on gross incomes, taxation, and access to subsidised community services (such as labour market programs and child care services) is taken into account&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">we see the following&mdash;</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="318">

<PARA STYLE="Para">You cannot find that anywhere in last year's budget papers. Mr Fitzgerald, the President of the Australian Council of Social Service, explained further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Last year's budget measures, if fully implemented, will have a regressive impact overall&mdash;because people with the lowest incomes suffer the greatest proportionate reduction in purchasing power. The poorest households stand to lose more than twice as much as the richest households&mdash;even after the beneficial effect of the Family Tax Initiative is taken into account.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Households with disposable incomes (after tax and social security payments) of less than $200 per week lose on average 2.2% ($5.40) of their spending power. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Many single pensioners and unemployed people would fall within this group</EMPHASIS> .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Households with disposable incomes of more than $1,200 per week lose only 0.85% ($15.10) of their spending power.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Fitzgerald went on to say that this research was commissioned before the parliament considered all the budget proposals, so it does not even take into account all of the things that are going to happen. His final comment was that, if fully implemented, the last budget will leave most Australian households worse off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can it be that the Prime Minister and his cabinet are just not aware of the real impact of the budget on Australian families, especially those on low incomes&mdash;the real battlers in our society? Maybe it is so. Maybe it is the case that nobody in the government and none of the departments have bothered to look at the distributional impact of their budget. Of course, that work would show exactly what this work by the Australian Council of Social Service shows&mdash;the true impact of this budget on low income Australian families.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday in the House we saw the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) scrambling around in a fairly shamefaced way trying to account for her misleading of the House in the last session of the parliament. She still refuses to accept that the cuts to be made to child-care assistance mean that parents will have to pay considerably more for child care&mdash;if you take $500 million out of the child-care budget, somebody has to pay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These facts have been drawn to the minister's attention by parents and care providers. The figures they have prepared clearly show that low income families face the greatest increases as a proportion of their incomes. That is the critical measure. This analysis should have been included in the budget papers so that all Australian families who need child care would be able to see what the impact would be on their family budget. Of course, this budget is not going to require any such analysis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I talk to people in my electorate of Jagajaga, I find a growing concern about the hurt of budget cuts as they start to bite. I would like to put on the record a couple of examples. One is a sole parent who is studying part time at La Trobe University and working part time. Her income is $350 a week, which consists of earnings from part-time work, the sole parent benefit, the family payment and an Austudy loan. After claiming child-care assistance, her child-care fees are currently $47.80 a week. In April 1997, when the budget cuts come into play&mdash;the first round&mdash;the fees will increase to $55 a week, out of her income of $350 a week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another student from La Trobe University has just completed her diploma of education. She is a sole parent with two children, aged 4&half; and three. In 1996 her child-care fee was $79 a week. It has increased to $111 a week. These are very serious increases and will have a major impact on the standard of living of those two residents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At a recent meeting with pensioners in West Heidelberg, the situation of those needing dental treatment was again raised. There is no doubt that the axing of the dental service was one of this budget's most callous measures. This cut effectively targeted the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="319"> most disadvantaged in our community and, more than anything else, will make them second-class citizens. The fact that the axing of this program was roundly condemned by one of the Kennett government's senior ministers&mdash;the Victorian health minister&mdash;shows just how low this government is prepared to stoop and how hypocritical its claim is that it purports to represent all of us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government while in opposition said that it would not touch pensioner concessions, that the living standards of pensioners would be maintained. The complete abolition of the dental program is yet another example of budget dishonesty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another example of the government's hypocrisy and lack of honesty about the budget relates to home and community care. The government supposedly supports home and community care. It made great fanfare at budget time about not cutting Labor's commitment to a six per cent real increase in home and community care funding. The only problem&mdash;a classic example of give with the one hand and take with the other&mdash;is that this government has imposed a 20 per cent user charge on home and community care services. Surely a charter of budget honesty could not sit comfortably with such a blatant misrepresentation of the truth. It is not only cruel and hypocritical but also silly policy, and it certainly does not represent budget honesty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Home care services such as Meals on Wheels enable older Australians to live comfortably in their own homes. Taking them away or making them unaffordable by slapping on these economic rationalist style user charges will mean that people will have to stop using these services. The end result will be that people will be forced into nursing homes and acute care, which is much more distressing for older Australians and much more expensive for the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We agree with budget honesty, but it has to be about the impact of budget cuts on Australian families and on older Australians. We want to know the real impact of these cuts on all the people they will affect. This bill goes no way to assisting Australians to understand the impact of the changes. Certainly we 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> would be encouraging the government to go back and have another go to make sure that this time in this budget we will truly understand the impact of all these savage cuts on Australians.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today in support of the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill. I say at the beginning that this has to be one of the most refreshing pieces of legislation to come out of this House in recent times, but I find it rather distasteful as an Australian that we as a government are being forced to enact legislation which in effect enshrines honesty as part of the political process. Honesty should be inherent in everything we do as representatives of the Australian people. Indeed, it is unfortunate, to say the least, that truth has become a victim of what today is seen as political necessity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">US Senator Hiram Johnson in 1917 is quoted as saying that in war the first casualty is truth. The same can possibly be said of what has come to pass in modern Australian politics, as perfected by the previous government&mdash;when elections come, the first casualty is the truth. Our predecessors in government turned that concept into an art form. A now retired senator even had the gall to enshrine the misleading of the Australian people for political gain in the title of his book, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Whatever it takes</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But just what did it take for the ALP to bring about the need for legislation such as this? What did it take for the Australian people to eventually develop enough cynicism about Labor promises to finally treat Labor's political manipulation with the contempt it deserved and toss them out on their collective ears?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have laws in place in this country that make it an offence for company directors to mislead their shareholders in financial matters. But never in corporate history has a board of directors tried to cover up a $10 billion deficit. That is what happened at last year's election when the leaders of the Labor Party, the then board of directors, tried to mislead their shareholders, the Australian people, to the tune of $10 billion. I repeat that&mdash;$10 billion. That is one followed by seven zeros&mdash;probably more zeroes than Group Captain 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="320"> Clive `Killer' Caldwell saw during the three years of the last war that he was involved in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For such infamous deception in any other area of Australian life, criminal charges would be laid. But, in this case, the only penalty the nation can inflict on the perpetrators is annihilation at the ballot-box&mdash;which, fortunately for the future of Australia, proved to be the case for the Keating government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the saddest aspect of all of this is that the level of government morality and accountability has been allowed to descend to such depths of contempt for the people and proper and moral government process that politicians currently rate the same as snake oil salesmen in public esteem. Is it any wonder, given the Labor doctrine of `whatever it takes', that politicians in this country are now held in the low esteem that they are?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of us coming into this job do so with the intent of serving the people with honour and honesty. Unfortunately, those on the other side of this House, who see themselves as the movers and shakers of what passes for modern Labor political doctrine, contemptuously attribute such attitudes to the height of naivety.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I listened earlier to the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) criticising us for a whole range of cuts in various services. It is very difficult to preside over some of those cuts. But from a business perspective, if you expect to see money in the bank to do a particular job but when you go to the bank to start to write cheques are told that you are well and truly in overdraft and cannot draw on those cheques, you have to look for some other way of addressing the problem because, if you do not deal with it now, it will only continue to grow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is one of the big problems we found when we got into government. There were a whole range of services mentioned&mdash;meals on wheels, aged care, disabled services and mental health&mdash;that we would all love to see a lot more money put into. I can assure you that in the electorate of Leichhardt one of the things we really need is regional services and infrastructure. Unfortunately, we have to sit back a little and wait. That is unfortunate because we have been missing out for a long 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> time. It is about time we got our fair share. But when the money has been squandered and we go into government hoping to rectify some of these problems and find such a massive deficit, it makes it almost impossible to provide the kind of service we would like to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can remember that, during the course of the previous campaign, we pushed very hard for the then Prime Minister, Mr Keating, to come clean and tell us what the financial situation was. We were continually reassured that everything was in order, that there was not a problem, that the figures and facts we were given were quite accurate. Of course, that is basically what we had to accept. We had no way of finding out if anything was different. So we had to base our budgets, our planning and our commitments on those figures that were available on the day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said earlier, $10 billion is a hell of a lot of money to have to find&mdash;in anybody's language&mdash;and it is just totally impossible to do that. That is very unfortunate. The cynicism of the Australian people continues to grow because they do not realise just how difficult it is. It is important to try to cover that sort of thing, and we all have to suffer the pain for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important that we make sure that, in the future, we do not put governments in the same situation we found ourselves in on 2 March. One does not need too much intelligence to realise that the Australian voting public is heartily sick and tired of such deception. Those who desert the honest Aussie discipline of `a fair go for all' will pay the penalty for diminished respect by being tossed into political oblivion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would hope that this bill&mdash;the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill&mdash;is the start of a whole raft of bills that will see the uplifting of political morality and accountability to the people of this nation. It is also my hope that legislation from my government will also enshrine in law the concept of truth in political advertising as part of the healing process between the political process and the Australian people. We as a government have the intestinal fortitude to wear our accountability on our sleeve and to set the scene for the demise of political deception by enshrining in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="321"> legislation the right of the Australian shareholders to know exactly what is the financial state of their company, Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the passing of this bill, when the voting public goes to the polls for the next time, they will do so with the solemn assurance that the fiscal facts upon which they are basing their voting decision will be the truth and not a `whatever it takes' bid to obtain power at any cost. It is contemptuous for any government to think that they can fool all of the people all of the time, but that is the contempt with which the Labor Party held the Australian people. Its record of broken promises, deceptions, untruths, illusory and creative national accounting have relegated the honour of this parliament to the depths from which it is now viewed by the Australian people. I for one take particular exception to being relegated to those depths, but it is with a real hope for the future that I gladly take part in the legislative process that will change these perceptions. Governments must be judged on their performance, not on perceptions and illusions created by deception. This bill will achieve that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the secretaries to the Treasury and the Department of Finance preparing a pre-election report which provides an up-to-date fiscal and economic outlook assessment, never again will political parties have the opportunity to attempt to deceive the Australian people to the massive extent that proved to be the case in 1996. Never again will the contemptuous `whatever it takes' doctrine replace what should be and always should have been the basic precept of good government&mdash;the truth.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to support in general terms the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill. In doing so, I wish to clearly state that, from my point of view, honesty in the provision of budget information is something that the Labor Party wholeheartedly supports. I will tell you why. I think it is about a question of honesty, performance and a willingness to lay on the table for public consideration where the Australian economy is going.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We really learnt the significance of that approach to government when the Labor Party was last elected to government in 1983. From a more public point of view, clearly the Australian community then knew what a bad state the Australian nation was in. The public indicators were issues that were clearly spoken about and debated in the lead-up to the election of March 1983. It was a debate going to the need to develop the concept of one nation. Australia was divided. It was a country of very low economic performance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were things in the public indicators that really caused concern to the majority of the Australian electorate. They included, for example&mdash;this was the record of the current Prime Minister (Mr Howard), who was the then Treasurer&mdash;prime interest rates of the order of 22.5 per cent, an unemployment rate of over 10 per cent and an inflation rate of over 10 per cent. In 1982, I might say in passing, the current Prime Minister, when last Treasurer, held the record for job losses in the manufacturing industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that, Australia was also confronted by a situation of what was, in essence, an industrial period of confrontation. That, in turn, resulted in low investment and very poor levels of economic growth. The real problem was that whilst those indicators, which are more publicly available, were known to the Australian public in March 1983, the Australian public then discovered after the election that the current Prime Minister had gone out of his way to conceal from the Australian electorate the real performance of his government. He was one of the prime movers in that government, as the Treasurer, on the question of the deficit. We have heard in recent months since the election of March last year questions of budget blow-outs, deficits and the need to face up to hard economic decisions, going to the need for cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to say in passing&mdash;this is why we very much support the thrust of this bill&mdash;that prior to the election in March 1983, the then Treasurer, the current Prime Minister, not only deliberately sought to deceive the Australian public but left the incoming Labor government with an absolute economic mess from the point of view of the budget. The 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="322"> deficit he left the Australian public with was of the order of 4.9 per cent of GDP. We have heard deficit figures quoted in the last 10 months or so of the order of $7 billion, $8 billion or $9 billion. In current terms, the deficit of 4.9 per cent that the Prime Minister left the Australian community with in March 1983 was no less than $24.5 billion in current dollar terms. That is what we inherited in March 1983.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is for that very reason that, as a result of that experience, when in government over a period of 13 years, the Australian Labor Party moved to make the budget process and documents much more open and visible. We believe that the Australian community was entitled to know the real state of the economy so that they could make decisions in electoral terms on the basis of the performance of the then government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note that, despite the rhetoric, on a number of occasions since the election in March 1996, the Prime Minister has been forced to concede that the economy he inherited was, if anything, fairly rigorous in performance. We note from time to time in this day and age that the Treasurer (Mr Costello) likes to stand at the dispatch box and speak, for example, about what a great achievement they have now put in place on the inflation front.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That achievement, in turn, is related to the hard decisions of the previous 13 years&mdash;the question of a decent wages policy. That is what it is all about. It goes back to March 1983&mdash;the concept of openness in government and the concept of one nation pulling together, which was a rejection of the divisiveness of the Fraser period of government from 1976 to 1983.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I raise these issues because I believe that there ought to be a bit of honesty about the state of the economy as at March 1996. The dishonesty that has prevailed since March 1996 has really been about the current government misleading the Australian public prior to the election in March 1996 as to its real intentions if it won government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have all been told time and time again by the government that the reason for the savage budget cuts is the so&hyphen;called $8 billion 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> black hole left by the outgoing Labor government in March 1996. I suggest to you that there is simply no foundation in either economic responsibility or political morality for that assertion. Moreover, the blow&hyphen;out claim is not based on any excessive expenditure prior to March 1996; it is simply a prediction or guess about what would have happened in the future, especially with respect to economic growth rates. As you and I know, Mr Deputy Speaker, those guesses constantly change, as the current Treasurer is currently finding with his black hole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was no element of concealment before the election by the Labor government of a likely fall in growth rates and thus a higher starting deficit for 1996-97. They are the real facts. The problem is that, for their own short-term political reasons, in a most dishonest fashion the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have deliberately misled the Australian public since the election in March 1996 with respect to the real issues going to the performance of this economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also suggest that that was related to the fact that the coalition's pre-election promises amounted to something of the order of $6.8 billion over three years and were unfunded to the tune of a massive $4 billion, according to the finance department estimates at the time. The problem was that the government of the day was not interested in the real hard facts. It wanted to use the false, misleading and dishonest $8 billion black hole argument to blame Labor for the cuts that the coalition failed to come clean with prior to the election of March 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just by way of interest, I might refer to some of those so-called promises that have now disappeared. It really goes to the crux of this debate&mdash;the question of honesty in government. Let us go to the ABC. The pledge was: we will maintain existing funding for the ABC. In respect of higher education, the pledge was: we will maintain the level of funding of operating grants to universities. Strangely, the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, has forgotten that pledge. With respect to labour market programs&mdash;and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="323"> I see one of the ministerial assistants in the House at the moment&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LS4">Mr MARTIN FERGUSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The pledge&mdash;one that the parliamentary secretary, Mr Abbott, now seeks to run away from&mdash;was: we are going to maintain the expenditure on labour market programs in real terms. I do not consider a cut of $1.8 billion over four years in labour market program expenditure, with the serious impact it is having on regional Australia, to be the maintenance of that pledge to honesty and commitment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn to the issue of jobs in research and development, the tax concession. The pledge was: changes to the syndicated research and development tax concession scheme guidelines may well result in the drying up of one of the few effective forms of venture capital available in Australia to fund research and development. They pledged to maintain support for research and development through the 150 per cent tax concession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn to regional development&mdash;and there are a lot of regional members on the other side of the House at the moment who, I know, are worried about this so-called commitment that has been broken and thrown out the window in a most dishonest fashion since the election last year. The pledge was: we will maintain funding for regional development at $150 million over four years. They now say that there is no constitutional role for the Commonwealth in regional Australia. So much for that pledge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for state and territory funding, we know what the Premiers' view of the Treasurer is at the moment. The pledge was: a fixed share of Commonwealth revenue which should be revenue neutral. I tell you what: if I were the Treasurer, I would not want a friend like the Premier of Victoria at the moment, who at every available opportunity sticks the knife in the Treasurer's back because of his unwillingness to meet the pledges given to the Australian electorate prior to the last election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, we will deal with the issue of taxation, again at the feet of Treasurer. The pledge was: there will be no new taxes and no 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> increase in existing taxes under a coalition government. The Australian community has very quickly seen through that so-called pledge&mdash;that statement of budget honesty given to the Australian electorate prior to the election of last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In essence, for those reasons I very much support the thrust of this bill. I also argue that it in essence continues the good work commenced by the previous Labor government because of our experiences of March 1983 and the deliberate and dishonest manner in which the then Treasurer, the current Prime Minister, failed to face up to his responsibilities to tell the Australian electorate the real state of the economy prior to March 1983. More importantly&mdash;and he cannot point the finger at the Australian Labor Party as at March 1996&mdash;he deliberately went out of his way prior to March 1983 to hide the figures and failed to make them available to the Australian electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today I also want to point to some of the dishonest actions and practices of this government in contrast to the statement of budget honesty it professes today. I particularly want to go to its budget forecasts and its policy on jobs. The Prime Minister said before the election that unemployment was the greatest single issue facing Australia. He even runs around the country now making wishes about his desire to reduce unemployment. But when it comes to the question of a policy or a government commitment to do something about it, the government seems to be absent with respect to ideas or positive programs to assist on that front.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He promised to reduce unemployment. He made a lot of fanfare about it, too. But since the election the problem is that the budget strategy of the government has done much to increase unemployment. It is almost as if they have chosen to ignore their pledge to the Australian electorate in the lead-up to the last election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first budget&mdash;and so much for budget honesty&mdash;was a no&hyphen;jobs budget, despite the commitment of the Prime Minister to the Australian electorate to make jobs the priority in his first term of government. Not only is it a no&hyphen;jobs budget; its initial target was abso 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="324"> lutely pathetic&mdash;a target of reducing unemployment to 8.25 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Suddenly, despite the fact that the target was so pathetic&mdash;in normal circumstances, with the state of the economy that the Prime Minister inherited, you could have expected to achieve an even greater target than 8.25 per cent&mdash;what do we get in the revised budget estimates? A new statement that unemployment will be 8.5 per cent. It has gone up! It should have been reduced on the basis of the state of the economy that we handed over to the incoming Prime Minister and the Treasurer. Is this real budget honesty?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also question whether or not the revised target of 8.5 per cent is a real target. I say that because of statements by private forecasters such as Access Economics. We all know the historically close relationship between Access Economics and the Howard government. On a number of occasions they have been engaged to give economic advice and to test coalition policies. I assume that fees were paid by the Liberal Party secretariat for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note that Access Economics is now suggesting that unemployment will be even higher than the mid-term review sets out. They suggest that it might be as high as nine per cent. That, I might say, is despite the fact that Access Economics, in consideration of these issues, has also made it clear that it has factored in the so-called budget strategy and the industrial relations changes&mdash;the panacea for increasing jobs in Australia and reducing unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They also say&mdash;I know this hurts the government&mdash;that the Australian Capital Territory has just gone into recession. I suppose in essence that would not really worry the Prime Minister because in the mind of this government Canberra, the national capital, is no longer seen as the place of head of government. Kirribilli House, the great sights of the Sydney Opera House and the city of Sydney are home to this government, rather than the national capital. The Australian Capital Territory in recession, I dare say, would not even worry the Howard government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is no wonder unemployment is on the increase when you consider what this govern 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment has done on the jobs front. The promise was insignificant reductions in government employment. Budget honesty, some would say. We are talking about something of the order of 20,000 to 30,000 Public Service jobs to go in this first term of government. Talk to the CES workers in Mareeba in Far North Queensland, who lost their jobs when the local CES was closed, or to the ones in North Melbourne. Talk to those who were employed in the department of immigration in Townsville and who lost their jobs.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Also in Wollongong, as the member for Cunningham has reminded me. Go to those who were employed in the Taxation Office in Lismore, or to those who were employed in the Family Law Court in Launceston. All went to the election with a sense of job security. Yes, the Prime Minister was going to be honest. He gave a commitment about government employment, but I suppose the problem is that he did not tell them it was not a core promise. Their jobs have disappeared. Their sense of security for their families has disappeared. Their ability to look after their children and educate them and ensure they are able to access a decent health care system has disappeared. I think that is fairly important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister also tried to suggest, in what he regarded as an honest fashion, prior to March 1996 that he was about the family and that he was committed to family values and honesty in government. He had this great ministerial code of conduct that was going to be strictly adhered to. We thought that ministerial code of conduct, that statement of honesty in government, was in tatters prior to Christmas of last year. If it was not in tatters prior to Christmas last year, the performance of Senator Woods has clearly established in the mind of the Australian community that it is absolutely in tatters in February 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I raise these issues because I very much support the charter of budget honesty. I tell you what: it is about time the Howard government was honest with the Australian community. It misled the Australian community in the lead-up to the last election. It has broken promises time and time again since the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="325"> last election, and has tried to create a smokescreen about a black hole and core and non-core promises. Worst of all, it has failed to deliver on what I regard as the most important promise to the Australian electorate&mdash;increasing jobs, creating a sense of job security, creating a sense of security for families and reducing unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is almost as if the Prime Minister has admitted defeat on the unemployment front. His employment minister has also acknowledged that as she runs from TV station to TV station, now stating that unless they get unemployment down their electoral prospects do not look all that good. I agree with Senator Vanstone on this occasion. I hope, despite the endeavours of the general secretary of the Liberal Party, Mr Robb, that at least she continues to make a few honest statements in her portfolio going to the electoral prospects of the Liberal Party on the basis of its lack of performance on the employment front. John Howard made promises to the Australian electorate. One of those was on the issue of reducing youth unemployment, which has increased by 14 per cent since the last election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us hope that the concepts and objectives of this bill at least result in an improved sense of honesty on the other side of the House. We know how dishonest they were prior to the election of March 1983 when we assumed government. The current Prime Minister was the then Treasurer and he deliberately misled the Australian public as to the state of the deficit. I also contend that they deliberately misled the Australian public in the lead-up to the last budget so as to merely implement their Fightback strategy and to create a smokescreen around their real intentions prior to the election of March 1996. The Australian public expects honesty in government. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to enter this debate on the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill and I do so with the benefit of having listened to some interesting previous speeches. I confess that I learned a new word when I read the contribution of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans). He started with his 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> description of the bill by saying that `it takes a considerable degree of chutzpah'. I am indebted to him for that, but I am not quite sure whether it really advances the debate at all when what we are really looking at here is a modest but good proposal to do something about the budget, about fiscal honesty, about disclosing to the people the true financial position and about keeping the people informed of the true fiscal position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is true that, in considering the position of politicians in this country generally over the years, the Australian public when listening to figures&mdash;and we have seen even in this debate figures proposed by one side and figures proposed by the other side&mdash;generally wonder who is telling the truth, whether there is any truth in any of these statements or whether it is something in between.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From listening to those sorts of assertions, I suspect the people of Australia end up with a great degree of cynicism of the whole process. It is that degree of cynicism that we as members of parliament have to be very wary of, particularly as members of political parties, because more and more people out there are saying: `How can you believe any politician? How can you trust any political party? How can you take any great notice at all of what is said?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to engender confidence in the community because I think the economic future of this country really will turn on how confident the people of Australia feel about the direction in which the country is going. If there is no confidence in the community, it will not matter what is said about the figures on one side or the other because we&mdash;I say `we' in a total sense; the people of Australia&mdash;will not see our country progressing; our standard of living at least being maintained, if not improved; and jobs for our children being enhanced and secured.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Therefore, in that overall context, the very least that members opposite might concede is that this is a start. I think that that even came from the previous speaker, my honourable friend the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson). He said that he supported the thrust of the bill. That is something that I 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="326"> think is worthy of him to concede, but at the same time he managed to pour a lot of scorn upon what has occurred since the election. With the greatest respect to him, I think that will be seen as purely rhetoric in the overall scheme of things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the people of Australia are really looking for is a government with direction and that is the government that we have got. This proposal before the House is giving direction as to the future charter of budget honesty. It is giving the people of Australia something so that they can confidently say, `At last we have got a direction whereby we can look at these sorts of proposals, hopefully, in a less cynical light.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not hard to understand why that cynicism is out there. I am only a recent member of this House. There are members of this House who have been here for many years. Perhaps the cynicism of those members is a different form of cynicism to the cynicism generally in the community. During the last election campaign, for example, there was myth and there was reality. There was an extraordinary divergence between what was out there and what was said to be out there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To take one example, I can recall during the campaign the former Prime Minister saying that youth unemployment was only seven per cent, when we all knew it was about 30 per cent. You did not have to look at a sheet of paper or at some statistics to know that; you knew that by what you saw out there, what you were told on the ground and what you felt out there. That was what was happening. That was the degree of divergence between what was said to be there and what in fact was there. It is that sort of thing that is being hammered home to people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People switched off on the Labor Party during the last election because that was what was going on. They were being told that they were really very well off, that unemployment was quite modest and under control, and that the level of long-term unemployment was dropping&mdash;but we know that was really the revolving door of labour market programs deliberately designed to fudge the figures. All of those things basically caused people to switch off and not listen. Once that happens, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> it is political death. Once that did happen&mdash;and it obviously did during the election campaign&mdash;it was clear that Labor was going to take a savaging, which it did.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The lesson from all of that, in my view, has been appreciated by the government in looking at matters such as those proposed in the bill. During this debate I have appreciated some of the remarks made by the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher)&mdash;although I have not heard all of the speakers by any means. I think the member for Curtin looked at the bill in a lot more detail than I have. With his much greater experience of the parliamentary process, he concluded that it will go part of the way, but I think it will go a little bit further than that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that a start has been made with this bill. It is important&mdash;and I think the government with the bill has recognised this, but it must recognise it more&mdash;to understand, in the processes that we have, that the parliament's relevance to the executive government must be far more pronounced than we accept that it is. It is a sad thing, which I have seen as a new member, that so few people attend the chamber. Is that really a determinant, in the overall scheme of things, of the parliament's relevance to the executive?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A point to the same effect was conceded to me recently by a former minister. He noticed, being in opposition rather than in government, that the difference is marked when he looks at the question of the role of the executive and the role of the parliament. Naturally enough, now that he is on the other side of the House he has come to have a far greater appreciation of the importance of parliament and the standing orders of the parliament and how they can be used to effect certain legitimate tactics and to expose whatever particular measures the government or anyone else has said require further explanation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I am trying to say is that, at the end of the day, people in the community expect honesty. It is all right to rattle off, as the member for Batman did, a whole list of core and non-core promises and all of these things that he says were broken. The bottom line is that people do expect honesty. If you have to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="327"> break promises, they expect you to be honest about them. Even if there are difficulties in the budget, people expect honesty. If they do not get honesty, if they get thrown a whole list of figures that really can be brought up by either side of any debate to justify a proposal, they switch off. They then say, `Well, all politicians are dishonest. We're not listening,' and then what I think is an unhealthy cynicism sets into the equation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is important to ensure that cynicism does not become a disease in the community, because the more it does, the more the relevance of this place as an integral part of our society becomes diluted and the more people out in the community are going to take other actions which are perhaps not the sorts of actions we want to see in this country. We have to keep reminding ourselves that we are servants of the people. We are here not to be agents of the Public Service; we are the agents of the people to the Public Service. We have to remember that in our dealings with that sector of the community and remember that in relation to our position in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is important to dispel a cynicism, which has become perhaps more than unhealthy, in society about the political process generally. This is an attempt to do that. This is a proposal to do that. It is a proposal, in my view, that sets a step along the way. I think most of the speakers have conceded that, except we have had the political points that have been made. You expect that in a debate like this. I do not think it does either side of the debate a great deal of credit to spend the whole time condemning and castigating this bill, given what they perceive to have been broken promises in the past and what has occurred and so forth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many things that we can refer to in the past. We can go back virtually 20 or 25 years and talk about something that occurred during the Whitlam government but, at the end of the day, people are looking to the government to provide answers, to provide direction and to provide an honest appraisal of the accounts and the fiscal direction of this particular government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we consider what the government is trying to do with these proposals, I think we 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> must conclude that it is a good step along the way. I emphasise this: it is a start that would not have been made had the previous government been re-elected. There is absolutely no doubt about that. I am sure we would not be here debating a charter of budget honesty if Mr Keating had been re-elected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do have that start. We do have a determination to progress honesty in terms of this particular measure. I think it is a start that will demonstrate to the Australian people that there is a determination to provide them with some figures which they can look at and examine. They can then form their own views based on what this bill requires of the incumbent government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I support this measure. I commend the government for the proposal. I look forward to the rest of this debate on the basis that it is a modest but good start&mdash;a start that we need to have in this country.</PARA></SPEECH>

According to the Prime Minister, he forgot about it&mdash;so much so that he did not even think about it when asked by Ray Martin on TV when he first became aware of the Woods affair. This Prime Minister is supposed to be concerned 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="328"> about standards in parliament, standards in government, about ethics, about integrity, about honesty.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am happy to do so, Mr Deputy Speaker. As has already been indicated, the opposition has no general disagreement with the government over the passage of the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill. In so far as it seeks to build on the fiscal disclosure regime developed under the Hawke and Keating governments, that bill deserves support. But my concerns with this legislation relate to some of its specific provisions, the motivation behind them, its lack of attention to unemployment and its monumental hypocrisy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In advocating the passage of this bill, the Prime Minister has sought to reinvent himself as a latter&hyphen;day fiscal messiah. Unfortunately, he is discovering that that crusade is being badly undermined by the performance of his senior acolytes. It has already been mentioned in the debate that this legislation selects a 40&hyphen;year time frame. That is curious and serves no constructive purpose. However, perhaps the significance of that is clear when we look at biblical imagery, where we can recall the epic 40&hyphen;year sojourn of the chosen people in the desert. The Prime Minister, like Moses, wants Australians to follow him into an economic wilderness on the vague assurance of a promised land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also relies heavily on the theme of honesty. In seeking to infuse this admirable quality into the title and wording of his legislation, the Prime Minister is attempting to construct a moral gulf between his government and the opposition. He should reconsider, because what he is constructing more closely resembles a crucifix. The recent 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="329"> announcements of the mid&hyphen;year review indicate this quite clearly. It is his government which will be nailed to it at the next election. If the Prime Minister wants to stake out honesty as the battleground for the next election, I for one am happy to accommodate him. Amongst his followers are ministers whose denials are coming quicker than any apostle's. Peter denied Christ three times before the cock crowed, which did his reputation no good. But, compared with the rate at which Liberal promises, core and non&hyphen;core, are being cast aside, Peter the apostle ranks as a mere amateur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we consider the other Peter, Peter the Treasurer, after 11 months he would be the last person his leader would turn to and say, `You are the rock on which I will build my church.' It is unwise to build anything on sand and even unwiser to build in a vacuum. The Treasurer assured the states that the coalition would provide a fixed share of Commonwealth revenue to the states and territories. Peter the Treasurer took only three months to ditch that promise at the Premiers Conference. The Treasurer also did a pretty good impersonation of George Bush when promising no new taxes and no increases in existing taxes. But higher Medicare levies, superannuation surcharge and increased out&hyphen;of&hyphen;pocket medical expenses have destroyed this guarantee in record time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Treasurer is not the only minister failing badly on the issue of honesty. The Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) started to discover how tough honesty can be as a benchmark very early in the piece. On election night, in response to Jim Middleton's question about maintaining funding for the ABC, the senator responded, `Absolutely.' Months later, after announcing a $50 million funding cut, he tried to rationalise this misleading statement with a lame reference to the euphoria of the night!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These ministers have demonstrated how onerous the government's task will be in living up to any honesty benchmark. The Prime Minister, having already encountered problems with his code of conduct, should understand this better than most. We can 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> recall that he was forced to throw some money changers out of the temple; he may have to cast a few more adrift before his term is over.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The genesis of this bill can be found in the Prime Minister's headland speech of 18 months ago where he talked about rebuilding trust in government. That is an admirable aim. But what have we actually seen? What we have seen is the Costello black hole&mdash;according to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, a `$1.6 billion bungle'. We have seen a mid-year revision of the deficit&mdash;now showing an $8.5 billion deficit with a $2.9 billion blow&hyphen;out for this year&mdash;and estimates that a budget error will open up a $3.5 billion a year hole in the revenue base by the time of the next election and the Treasurer blaming the Australian Taxation Office and his treasury department for that error. That is an appalling state of affairs and, no doubt, one which has contributed to the recent fall in the coalition's support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But just as serious as the blow&hyphen;out in the budget deficit and Treasurer Costello's own black hole has been the  indication that unemployment will now rise from the estimated 8.25 per cent to 8.5 per cent. Let me take the House back to the assurances offered by the coalition concerning unemployment prior to the last election. As Michael Millett from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> describes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition's employment policy, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Pathway to Real Jobs</EMPHASIS> , issued in February 1996 professes an acute awareness of the problem and is not backward in proclaiming its ability to deliver a permanent solution.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The document itself said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Coalition policies will move Australia back towards full employment: the situation where paid employment is available for anyone who seeks it.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Job Creation Strategy will deliver this objective.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">But, since then, we have seen the Howard government resolutely refuse to set any targets for cutting unemployment. We have seen the revised forecasts for the unemployment rate going up from 8.25 per cent to 8.5 per cent. The government has no strategy, no idea, on how to deal with it.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="330">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, all they say is, `Give us our tired, old right-wing agenda and we will see if we can do something about unemployment.' When we talked to them about unemployment last year they said, `Let us get our budget through. Let us have the fiscal consolidation strategy.' Then later when we talked to  them about unemployment they said, `Give us our industrial relations legislation. Let us get our workplace reform bill through the Senate and then something will happen about jobs.' Well, nothing has happened about jobs and now you have Victoria's Premier Kennett recently saying, `Let us have a GST. Give us a GST so we can create some jobs.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Liberal government has no answers and no policies on cutting unemployment. They just want that tired old right-wing agenda: take from those who are poor; give to those who are already well off. That is all they have to say about unemployment. I think that by far the most objectionable aspect of this bill is its neglect of Australia's unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Back in June 1995 Australians listening to the Prime Minister would have taken his commitment to budget honesty to apply to the range of government economic policies. Unemployment featured prominently in the coalition's rhetoric. As I said before, they claimed that the national job creation strategy would deliver a situation where paid employment is available for anyone who seeks it. Well, under this government&mdash;not in my lifetime, it won't.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the information service's very detailed summary of the bill, I could not find the word `unemployment' mentioned once&mdash;not once. There was no reference to the importance of providing work to those who want it, no reference to the significance of work and the opportunity of work for younger Australians&mdash;not a word. If unemployed Australians need any proof that the government, like Pontius Pilate, is washing its hands of them, they need only to consider last week's abysmal mid-year review, with the government finally acknowledging that the budget had blown out and that unemployment would rise rather than fall.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What makes the government's lack of interest in unemployment in this bill unforgiv 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> able is that the research that it has itself carried out demonstrates clearly that its own policies are impacting on unemployment. According to Michael Millett, government research late last year revealed that even with sustained, faster economic growth unemployment would be unlikely to fall to what were described as politically acceptable levels by the turn of the century. The ominous warnings of that research have been reinforced in the last few days by further bad tidings which will do nothing to improve the jobless rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet, as retail sales slump to a 30-year low, the government still wants Australians to believe that it can deliver. Even as bankruptcies for 1996 rose 23 per cent on the previous year, the government says that things are looking great. The Prime Minister referred, I think, to a `rare conjunction of economic circumstances.' Next he will be telling us, `You've never had it so good.' Even as the nation's biggest bank predicts a dangerously low growth rate of 2.75 per cent and others realistically consider the possibility of negative growth, the government says that things are on track. This self&hyphen;delusion is dangerous for this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us have a look at what the Treasurer has been saying. This is the man who tried to turn water into wine with his first budget, but ended up with $3 billion worth of bilge. Last week, according to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, the Treasurer claimed it would be easier to sell a second wave of labour market reforms if unemployment remains high. The paper concluded that the government would attempt further workplace reform because its assessment of the Australian economy was that unemployment will get worse. If we were ever to have a fair dinkum charter of budget honesty, the Treasurer would be out of a job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This week we have seen both the federal director of the Liberal Party and the minister for employment and higher education, another who has found honesty a difficult benchmark&mdash;remember the story of the Wright family&mdash;ducking the issue of whether the government could reduce unemployment. They were starting to maintain that all you need to do is to look serious about tackling the problem. What an abject cop-out. This is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="331"> the party that has steadfastly refused for years to match Labor's commitment to a five per cent unemployment rate by the turn of the century and this same party has the audacity to bring before the House a bill intending to establish stricter scrutiny of fiscal performance. At the same time it sets no targets for unemployment and disseminates fudgy figures on unemployment. No wonder unemployment does not feature in the language of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill quite clearly demonstrates that the coalition's commitment to fighting unemployment is paper thin. It has no intention of making unemployment its top priority. If it were to do so, you would see unemployment projections featuring prominently in this bill. The Prime Minister's commitment to fighting unemployment has become a non&hyphen;core promise. The unemployed are finding that, as John Howard seeks to reinvent himself as an economic messiah, it is they who have been forsaken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I want to make a few points about the opposition's concern regarding the specific provisions of the bill. In some respects, it is a bill which provides for even less accountability than recommended by the government's own Commission of Audit on this question of charter. For example, the commission recommended making the economic forecasts in the budget&mdash;the mid&hyphen;year review and the pre&hyphen;election report&mdash;the responsibility of economic bureaucrats instead of their being at the discretion of the Treasurer. The government has only agreed to this in respect of the pre&hyphen;election statement, not in respect of the budget and the mid&hyphen;year review. New Zealand, by contrast, requires relevant bureaucrats to certify the economic forecasts for all parts of the economic cycle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition would ask the question: why is the Treasurer not prepared to submit himself to the same level of honesty as obtains in New Zealand? We wonder about the veracity of the forecasts in his first test&mdash;the recently released mid&hyphen;year review. This proposal before the House is in stark contrast to the Treasurer's practice while in opposition. He asked the then Treasurer that the 1995&hyphen;96 economic forecasts in the 1995&hyphen;96 budget be certified by the Secretary to the Treasury as 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> having been prepared without political interference. That was duly done in writing. But there is no equivalent provision in this bill to bind the Treasurer to undertake the practice that he required the Labor Treasurer to undertake. So why is there this inconsistency?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the issue of fiscal principles, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, having considered the issue of fiscal principles, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee does not see a need to formulate binding statutory principles of fiscal responsibility. In any case, such fiscal principles would be so imprecise and so wide open to interpretation that there seems little point in prescribing them in legislation. That committee is also wary of the idea that there are enduring fiscal principles.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So, given those sorts of observations, we believe that this legislation should be referred to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. In recommendation 19, report No. 341, the committee said that any fiscal reporting bill, such as this bill, should be referred to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts subsequent to its tabling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regrettably, the government ignored this recommendation when the legislation was introduced. We would think they should take up the opportunity now, remedy the situation now. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts is an expert body which should examine this legislation. Indeed, any obstruction by the government of this proposal suggests that it has something to hide.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a member of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts in both this parliament and the previous parliament, it is indeed a pleasure to support the introduction of the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill 1996 in this House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note that the previous speaker referred to the JCPA. It was, in fact, report No. 341 that recommended the establishment of fiscal responsibility legislation. Interestingly enough, that report was tabled back in 1995, when the Labor Party was still in government, so it was interesting to listen to the comments by the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) when he referred right back to 1983&mdash;some 14 years ago. The Labor Party have got very long memories when they want to, but not when they do not. The 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="332"> member for Batman was referring to the situation that the Labor Party inherited in 1983. The coalition, in the lead&hyphen;up to the 1996 election, made a commitment to the Australian people that we would have a charter of budget honesty. It did not take very long for proof to come forward of the necessity for this charter of budget honesty. It was within weeks of the election that the coalition in government found out the parlous state of the economy which had been deliberately concealed by the Labor Party in the lead&hyphen;up to that election campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Going back to the member for Batman, listening to his address to the House this morning on this bill, I welcomed his support for the bill. But, if the Labor Party knew in 1983 of the need for the introduction of a charter of budget honesty or fiscal responsibility legislation, why didn't they act then? If the Labor Party knew of the need for fiscal responsibility legislation in 1995 when the then Public Accounts Committee recommended the introduction of such legislation, why didn't they act? If the Labor Party knew it was necessary to introduce this as a sign of faith with the Australian people, why didn't they go to the election in March 1996 with that on their platform? They did not, because they knew they could not. They knew they could not, because they knew the people of Australia would not believe anything the Labor Party had to say about honesty in public life. There is no way that the voting public of Australia would have believed any utterance of the then Prime Minister, Paul Keating, about government honesty because his track record was absolutely abysmal. His track record was absolutely abysmal as far as honesty was concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the almost 12 months since that election, I have not heard&mdash;I will stand corrected&mdash;one member of the Labor opposition defend the former Prime Minister on that point, because they know that the l&hyphen;a&hyphen;w tax cuts broken promise was the central plank in the loss of that election last year. They know that following the leadership of Paul Keating in the lead&hyphen;up to the 1996 election was what cost them the election. But the coalition were able to communicate to the Australian people that we 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> understood that the Australian people were sick and tired of the smoke and mirrors tricks of the Labor Party for the previous 13 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to hear members of the Australian Labor Party debating this bill today and talking about honesty in government. For goodness sake, we had 13 years of Labor in this country, 13 years of Labor running up debt and deficit and trying to use sleight of hand tricks all the way down the line on the Australian people. The Labor Party treated the Australian people like fools and idiots. It treated them as though they had no understanding of the Australian economy. The Labor Party was in government for 13 years. The member for Batman knew about this situation, he alleges, in 1983. The JCPA reported in 1995. What action was there from the Labor Party? Absolutely none!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition promised this legislation to the people of Australia during the election in March last year. The now Prime Minister (Mr Howard), then the Leader of the Opposition, made it quite clear in one of his early headland speeches. The recommendation was in report 341. It was part of the policy platform that we presented to the Australian people in the lead&hyphen;up to the March election last year. Now here it is, being introduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All the Labor opposition can do is criticise elements of the budget that this government brought down in August last year. The members of the Labor Party do not talk about the principles or the philosophy behind the introduction of this legislation. They talk about the politics of the budget, a lot of which we were forced into because this sort of legislation was not in place last year and so we did not have access to the information. The now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) was challenged time and again to release the information, and yet he refused to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very important that the Australian people note that, within 12 months of being elected to office, the Howard government is introducing the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill. This bill puts in place a legislative framework for the conduct and reporting of fiscal policy. It implements our election commitment to bring greater financial ac 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="333"> countability and transparency to the federal government. It opens the books of the nation to greater public scrutiny, which in turn will instil great public confidence in the financial management of government.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the messages that the coalition managed to get through to the Australian people in 1996 was what the then Prime 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Minister, Paul Keating, amongst other things, had done to the Australian economy and the legacy of his 20&hyphen;plus years in federal politics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1983&mdash;I return to that year because the member for Batman introduced it in his speech this afternoon&mdash;foreign debt was $23 billion. In 1984, it was $28 billion; in 1985, $51 billion; in 1986, $75 billion; in 1987, $83 billion; in 1988, $93 billion; in 1989, $100 billion; in 1990, $124 billion; in 1992, $180 billion; and at the time of the election it was nudging $200 billion, of which nigh on $100 billion was generated by the Commonwealth government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister of the day, and during that process the Treasurer, said to the Australian people, `This is quite acceptable. The equity's there. Our country's worth it. If we've got to flog it off to pay our debts, we'll get good money for it. Don't worry about it, it's okay.' The then Treasurer and the then Prime Minister have left for greener pastures, but the debt still remains.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government did not create the problem we are faced with, but this government has the backbone, the steel and the honesty to talk to the Australian people, to look them in the eye and say, `We will fix the debt. We will fix this problem that was created by Labor.' And we will. This is part of the straight talk that we are engaging in with the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Everybody on the opposition side in this debate today has tried to explain away the $10 billion. The member for Batman talked about the deficit of 1983. It is now 14 years later. That is ancient history in this country. We are talking about what the Labor Party did for 13 years. If the Labor Party supposedly learnt its lesson in 1983, it did not learn it very well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party has done nothing but rack up debt and deficit for 13 years. It has not told the people of Australia about it. It has not told the people of Australia why it was doing it, where the money was being spent, what it proposed and what impact it was going to have on the people then and on future generations. The Labor Party refused to tell the Australian people. We are not going to sit in this chamber today and be lectured 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="334"> by the members of the Labor Party about honesty. They have absolutely no credibility in terms of political honesty. There is no doubt about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note an article that was written by Michelle Grattan about this particular issue in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 30 January. It was headlined, `There's a price, but honesty will pay off.' There is no substitute for honesty, Mr Deputy Speaker. She said in her article:</PARA>

So let's not hear anything from members opposite about the Labor Party's time in government and the honesty of ALP governments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is not opposed by the opposition in principle. What we do object to is its underlying hypocrisy and its inherent unfairness.

The joint committee is the most appropriate body to consider the further detail of this piece of legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Any attempt by any government of any persuasion to improve the reporting of its fiscal position to the Australian people should be encouraged.

That is all this legislation is: a crude attempt by this Prime Minister to exorcise a terrible political ghost from his past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fourteen years after this current Prime Minister delivered the worst fiscal mess ever to any incoming government, his government introduces a bill which is no more than a shallow mea culpa for the chaos in which he left the budget in 1982 and 1983. These are things that the Prime Minister would like to have us forget. He swans into office in 1996 on a raft of promises that have taken him barely nine months to break in a massive exercise of deceit. But we are not going to let him forget his past, not the long past and not the near past, because this is a prime minister who has an economic history, who does have a past&mdash;and we are going to continually remind the Australian people of it.

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="336"> excess of the growth rate that John Howard as Treasurer left Labor in 1982-83. At that time there was a negative growth rate in an economy that was shedding jobs by the thousands by the day. In 1996 Labor left John Howard with the lowest level of industrial disputation on record. In 1983 John Howard left Labor an industrial mess with the highest level of disputation seen in years. The level of interest rates was not the single digit figure Labor left John Howard in 1996. In 1983 John Howard as Treasurer left Labor interest rates in double digits. So not only did the Prime Minister leave Labor an economic mess in 1982-83; he left Labor a fiscal mess as well. He left a fiscal mess, a budget mess, and now he comes into this House parading himself as a paragon of economic virtue with a charter of budget honesty that he believes can erase his past.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us ponder the fiscal mess that John Howard left Labor in 1982-83. In current dollars, he left Labor a deficit of $25 billion. Honourable members need to get their heads around that. One by one you have come into this House and accused the Labor government of leaving you a deficit under half that. Indeed, if what Labor left you in 1996 was a horrible mess, how would you describe what John Howard left Labor in 1982-83&mdash;a $25 billion deficit in the federal budget and a ramshackle economy, a stagnant economy, with low growth and high unemployment?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wonder what the Treasurer (Mr Costello) would say about the state of the economy that John Howard left Labor in 1982-83. We know the Treasurer is but a suburban lawyer who is quick with the one&hyphen;liners but does not really have a grasp of economics. We can be thankful that in his first budget he has not had to grapple with a current dollar $25 billion deficit of the kind John Howard left Labor, an inflation rate of 10 per cent, an unemployment rate over 10 per cent, a negative growth economy, an industrial museum as far as the Australian economy was concerned and interest rates in double digits. I wonder how Treasurer Costello would handle that economic scenario.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One by one those opposite have come into this chamber and one by one they have 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> attempted to portray the economic record of 13 years of Labor as one presenting them with a massive economic problem. It demonstrates the sort of economic imbeciles you are. If you can come into this chamber and say to the Australian people that four per cent growth over four years is an economic disaster, if you can come into this chamber and say a level of inflation of two to three per cent is a disaster, if you can come into this chamber and say an unemployment rate coming down with a discrete plan to overcome it is a disaster and if you can come into this chamber and say the lowest level of industrial disputation since Federation is a disaster, then you are a greater pack of economic imbeciles then we give you credit for at this point.</PARA>

What if the people listening to this debate throughout the length and breadth of Australia today went to their children and said, `Christmas is coming up.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Don't you dare attempt to lecture us about transparency in budget processes.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was a wise person who once said that if you do not learn from what has occurred in the past, you run the risk of repeating it. It is very obvious from many contributions today, and most recently from the honourable member for Corio (Mr O'Connor), that the Labor Party representatives in this place have no interest whatsoever in dealing with today and the future. This is a great pity for them and it certainly proves that the people of Australia got it right on 2 March last year. We have an opposition in this place which, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> day after day, continues to prove just how out of touch it is with reality. It just keeps proving it. No&hyphen;one believes any of their tired rhetoric, their projection of what might be the value of whatever might have been the problem in 1983. People in Australia are more worried about what happened in 1996; what is happening in 1997, and what will happen in the years ahead, and this is what this government is all about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is all about honesty, openness and accountability in government. They are the three key words which everyone in this place should aspire to uphold. It is about letting the Australian people know that we, as parliamentarians, do not own the books; we are just the custodians. It is about acknowledging that we all know our place and that we are elected to run the nation for all the people. We are elected to mind the books properly and we are elected to make sure the national public accounts, which are the property of all Australians, not just the elected government of the day or the bureaucracy, are open for all to inspect. We are not elected to claim the tax funds collected as our own, but as a matter of great trust which has been placed upon us by the people of this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, for all of those reasons this bill before us today is a vital step in ensuring that no&hyphen;one in politics can keep the books closed for their own purposes, or can keep the books from the people of Australia. It is a duty which all of us in this place should share. We must never be afraid to account to the people of Australia; we must never be so arrogant as to presume that what they don't know won't hurt them. Not to pass this bill, to ignore the need to be accountable and to deal with the truth is a recipe for disaster for any government, and it is a reflection upon all of us who aspire to serve the nation by election to parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All honourable members know well the often cited criticisms by many people of those of us involved in politics. This bill is a statement to the justified cynics in our country that we all want to do better to justify the faith which was placed in us most recently on 2 March last year by our election to this place. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="339">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the last federal election campaign people often said to me that, essentially, they expected when we came to government we would find a worse position than the previous mob had confessed to. Few were really surprised when it was revealed that Mr Beazley had hidden a $10 billion black hole in the economy. It is really just not good enough that there is this sort of deception. As the then opposition, trying to announce alternative policies so the people of Australia could rightly consider them before they voted, we could only go on the financial advice which was exposed by the books held in the hands of that government. The previous government, as we all know, held back the true information, in particular when the now Leader of the Opposition, the then finance minister, was in charge. It is all very obvious this was for political advantage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The books are not any government's political plaything. The people of Australia deserve the truth, which is what they are going to get as a result of this particular bill. It is what we promised in opposition and during the election campaign, and it is what we are delivering. It is certainly very shameful to think standards fell so low during the 13 years of the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know most people do not necessarily understand all of the economic mumbo&hyphen;jumbo, but they certainly do understand plain, straightforward honesty. I think it is very sad that what should be regarded as the quite noble profession and aspiration of entering parliament has been downgraded by a few politicians who choose to put their own interests before the interests of their constituency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is straightforward for us all to understand that the Australian people want a certain amount of certainty which opening up the books of this country always reveals. People want to be able to know what the government forecasts the economy to be, and plan accordingly. Right now we are in a low inflation, low interest rate environment and growth may not be spectacular, but the economy will grow. After all, investment growth is already strong. It is as strong as an ox. Tomorrow is the beginning of a new lunar year, the Year 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of the Ox. Australians of an Asian heritage will know what this means: it means there are going to be stable economic conditions, just as this government rightly forecasts, for the next 12 months. The economy will grow, but it will take a deal of steady and sustained activity, and hard work will pay off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very obvious that Australians all realise that one of the outstanding features of this government, one which distinguishes the Howard government from the previous government, is our straightforward honesty, our openness, our accountability. It might be an alien concept to those opposite, but we are certainly doing our very best to explain time and time again through the course of this debate just how well it can work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For a start, we have done what we said we would do, and this legislation confirms our commitment to the processes of open government and responsible fiscal policy. This bill will prevent future governments going to an election on the basis of misleading information on the fiscal and economic outlook. It will ensure that at all times governments can be held properly accountable for their fiscal and economic policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of this bill, there will be no more fudging of the figures, or dodging of responsibility. There will be no more uncertainty for Australians. This government does not need to be prompted on these matters, of course. Did you see the Treasurer walk away when he realised recently that the budget forecast may not be realised? He faced the Australian people and explained the situation. He did not try to hide anything, or fudge any figures. This is what good government is all about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill will go further. It will enhance this already volunteered approach to discipline, transparency and accountability applying to the conduct of fiscal policy.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;May I say in reply to the honourable member for Bradfield that the difference of view between Australia and the European Union on this issue is not a dispute over Australia's commitment to human rights. Australia's commitment to human rights is unequivocal and our record is second to none. The issue at stake in this dispute is whether or not Australia should sign a treaty which clearly links trade with human rights and which, if this clause were included, would allow either party to suspend the agreement or terminate it unilaterally on the basis of undefined criteria.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The European Union's draft framework trade and cooperation agreement has as its first operative article respect for democratic principles and human rights. The draft identifies these as the basis and an essential element of the agreement and also has non&hyphen;fulfilment provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's position is that the EU proposals are quite inappropriate in a treaty covering trade. They are unacceptable to Australia and ought to be unacceptable to any country that has the human rights standing of Australia. We have proposed the inclusion of our common objectives on human rights with the European Union in a political declaration. The government also considered that the draft agreement in its current form would not protect or advance the interests of Australia's business community, which of course is one of the main aims for such an agreement. The 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="341"> draft did not offer Australia the progress it sought on agricultural trade and in energy. If the opposition is arguing that we should have signed the agreement in the form desired by the European Union, it would have sold Australia and the business community of our country short.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point I would like to make&mdash;and I think it is important that it be made in the context of this debate&mdash;is that suggestions have been made that in some way the government's refusal to accept the human rights clause is related to a possible response by the government to the Wik judgment. Can I make it very plain to the House and to the Australian people that our decision in relation to the human rights clause requested by the European Union was taken months ago, and in fact taken several months before the High Court of Australia brought down its decision in the Wik case on 21 December.</PARA>

The charges related to events in 1988 and 1989 concerning the Bond Corporation's takeover of the Bell group of companies. On 5 February Mr Bond was sentenced to four years gaol in relation to those charges to be served cumulatively with a three-year term of imprisonment he is currently serving in respect of the La Promenade matter.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. Can the minister tell the House how the government is responding to the needs of families and students across the country by providing for a fairer and more equitable payment of Austudy? In particular, what action is the government taking to address concerns about the administration of the actual means test?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="343" SPEAKER="Kemp, Dr David, MP" NAMEID="BT4" ELECTORATE="Goldstein" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Schools, Vocational Education and Training; Minister Assisting the Minister for Finance for Privatisation" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BT4">Dr KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government provides Austudy to students in financial need to make it possible for them to continue with their education. Because it is important that the maximum assistance affordable be provided to those in real need, Austudy payments are targeted to those whose means justify their payment. For a long time there has been community concern&mdash;which I believe would be reflected in the member for Dawson's question&mdash;that there are high income earners, wealthy people in the community, abusing the system by arranging their affairs to reduce their apparent income or assets at the expense of less well&hyphen;to&hyphen;do, battling families.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former Labor government introduced the so-called actual means test to determine the real means of those applying for Austudy. The Liberal and National parties before the last election agreed with the principle of the actual means test, which was that people should not be able to rearrange their affairs to reduce their apparent income or assets and thereby obtain Austudy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We did, however, express our view before the election that there were problems with the way in which this test had been constructed and was being implemented, and we undertook to review it. Following the election we did review the test, and in 1997 it is based on estimates of family expenditure provided by applicants themselves on the Austudy application form; if actual means are below the equivalent of the income test cut-off, they will be eligible for Austudy.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="344">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are discounts under the test for primary and secondary students from isolated families and for bona fide wages earned by students. Farming families who receive a drought relief payment or who are in receipt of farm household support are also exempted. The actual means test only applies to applicants who have opportunities to minimise their taxable income&mdash;that is, for example, those involved in a trust, a partnership or a private company, or those who are self&hyphen;employed; this is expected to be about 23 per cent of the total of Austudy applicants. Most of those who apply for Austudy will not be required to complete the actual means test form.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is aware that there is still significant concern, especially in rural communities, over the operation of the test. Senator Vanstone has acknowledged that there</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">remain difficulties with the application and administration of the test. There have been concerns raised about the actual means test hotline. Originally, there were 15 staff allocated to the hotline. I am very pleased to be able to inform the House that Senator Vanstone has directed that an additional 24 staff be attached to the hotline service. A further 14 staff started yesterday after training and a further 10 people are being trained and will come on shortly to service the hotline. These additional staff should very substantially improve, if not do away with, the problems that have been experienced with this particular service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other concerns have been raised over the way in which the actual means are determined from the information on the form. The government is presently conducting a detailed examination of these concerns with the aim of fixing any genuine problems that exist. Our aim is to ensure that the actual means test operates in a way which is fair and equitable to all concerned, so that those genuinely in need, because of insufficient means, can be most effectively helped.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Has the minister seen reports that the secretary of the ACTU, Mr Bill Kelty, has accused him of lying about the TWU's 11 per cent pay claim and has guaranteed that, if granted, the claim will not spill over into other industries? Can the minister comment on these reports?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="345" SPEAKER="Reith, Peter, MP" NAMEID="WI4" ELECTORATE="Flinders" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Industrial Relations; Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I certainly have seen the colourful remarks of Mr Kelty in this morning's press. I do not want to respond to the colour, but the substance of the debate is very important. The reason it is important is that we want a system that can genuinely give people wage increases. That is one of the central tenets of what we are trying to do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was beyond my comprehension when Bill Kelty said that an 11 per cent increase in award rates was not an 11 per cent increase in pay. In fact, it is the 11 per cent increase in pay which is what he says is the so-called benefit of this claim. If the claim is granted, the fact is that in some key parts of industry it would provide above safety net increases without corresponding productivity increases at the enterprise level. So it would foist higher costs on to a significant number of operators. It will also have a significant impact on industry competitiveness, so hurting jobs, and it will raise prices, particularly in regional areas. That is something we want to avoid. The promotion of a better deal for regional Australia is an absolutely key objective for this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth noting that some trucking companies in New South Wales have already started to increase their charges to reflect the changes which were granted to the New South Wales transport award last year by the New South Wales commission, which operates under legislation very different from that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="346"> which is relevant at the federal level. Those changes were similar in many respects to the TWU application before the commission. The fact is that similar increases in transport charges would be inevitable if its current application before the commission were to be successful. When I talk about flow-ons, I am talking about the flow&hyphen;ons within the transport industry from the big operators who are paying it to the small operators who cannot afford to pay it and for whom those cost increases would have significantly detrimental effects on the operation of their businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The TWU claim may have some benefit for some operators, but certainly not 11 per cent. The reality is that for many others it would not. I urge those employers to pursue the gains that they think are available through enterprise bargaining. I also call on them not to impose their deal onto other operators for whom it is not appropriate. If the TWU's claim were to succeed, it would send a clear message to other unions: `If you can't get a wage increase through bargaining, then try the award route.' According to this model, all you need is a few compliant employers and everyone in the industry can achieve a big increase regardless of the circumstances of the business, and it is obviously unlinked to productivity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not alone in seeking to oppose this application. Natroads, one of the employer organisations in this industry, said in its submission:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If there are to be offsets in return for wage rises over and above the safety net and those offsets vary from enterprise to enterprise, then these should be processed by way of enterprise agreements . . . on a case by case basis, and not via the award.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Australian Chamber of Manufactures commented:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The application if granted will act as a major disincentive to agreement making . . . The application is intended to be a substitute for bargaining at the enterprise level . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The reality is we do want to see a system based much more on enterprises. The beneficiaries of that will be those enterprises and the people who work with them. The interesting development on this whole issue as far as policy is concerned is that, when Labor was in opposition, their stated public policy 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> position was to move to an enterprise based bargaining system on the basis it would improve the conditions for average wage earners. You have walked away from that longstanding position. We have maintained a consistent position. I am very happy to engage Mr Kelty in this debate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. The answer is that we had to look pretty hard but, yes, we did find a bit of criticism. One piece of that emanated from the shadow minister for the environment, who issued a release called `False Security'. I must say I find that pretty amazing. The previous government was very keen to tell us that they were responsible for putting the RFA process in place but they could never actually deliver on it. We never got an outcome, but they wanted to claim credit. Yet they now criticise the very nationally agreed process for finding a balanced approach to conservation and forestry in this country that they wanted to claim credit for.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, of course, the East Gippsland RFA is a very valuable historic agreement. Of the 1.2 million hectares, around half will see forests of value preserved and around half will be available for sustainable forestry. Interestingly enough, that half or so that will be conserved represents a very significant increment over the Janus criteria, which was that we ought to seek an objective of 15 per cent of pre-existing forest types.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of the regional forest agreement, we are going to see, for example, new investment, the likely increase  in product out of the area of some $100 million a year and better utilisation of resources. As a result of heads of agreement struck between the Victorian government and industry, you will see a direct increase in the commitment to value adding. In short, it represents the balance, the sound policy, that Australians want.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is based on intellectual rigour and on scientific assessment. Those assessments took into account huge volumes of research and work that had been put together by Victorians and other researchers over the years. The bulk of the biological data came from what are called flora quadrate surveys, which are detailed studies of areas just 30 metres by 30 metres, one after the other. Information was drawn from the highest levels of academic, state and Commonwealth expertise. There was a lot of external peer review. It is a sound and rigorous process.

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> supplying great entertainment and great information to Australian sports lovers.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do, yes, very vividly. The government believes in an independent ABC, but if it believes that on occasions the spectrum of views expressed on the ABC&mdash;or, indeed, on any other broadcaster, but the ABC has a particular responsibility in this area because it is publicly funded&mdash;is too narrow, and if I have any views to express about the spectrum of views on the ABC I will take the opportunity of being as open and direct in public as I may be if I am talking to anybody in private.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to say to the parliament that the ABC has obligations of balanced objectivity and absence of bias to both sides of the political debate in this country.

I have said that to the faces of people in ABC management. I have said it openly and I have said it publicly, and I will say it again.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. Following Australia's participation in the rescue of the three solo yachtsmen in the Southern Ocean recently, can you inform the House how we can further build on our international reputation in civil search and rescue activity?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="349" SPEAKER="Sharp, John, MP" NAMEID="AJ4" ELECTORATE="Hume" PARTY="NP" MINISTERIAL="Transport and Regional Development" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AJ4">Mr SHARP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Lyne for his question. Earlier today I welcomed Mr Tony Bullimore, whom members would remember was one of those three gentlemen who was rescued just recently by our Australian defence forces&mdash;HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Adelaide </EMPHASIS> in this instance&mdash;after spending some four days in his upturned yacht. I welcomed him to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority's headquarters here in Canberra. The purpose of his visit was to thank the members of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority for their part in his rescue, as, indeed, he had already thanked the members of the Australian Defence Force for their role in his rescue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other aspect of his visit was to provide a debriefing session for those people responsible for search and rescue operations within AMSA to try to enhance our capacity in future years in matters such as the rescue that he was involved in. These debriefing sessions 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that Mr Dubois, Mr Dinelli and now Mr Bullimore have participated in have been enormously valuable in increasing our capacity in search and rescue areas. For example, some very simple and commonsense things such as painting the hulls of these yachts that go in these races bright orange so they can be more easily detected and altering the course of the yacht race to bring them closer to rescue services so the task of finding them is not so great have all been put forward in these debriefing sessions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In advance of all of this, in the middle of last year I initiated a review of our search and rescue operations here in Australia. Mr Pat Crone undertook that review. He highlighted the fact that we have three search and rescue headquarters in Australia, two run by Air Services Australia in Melbourne and Brisbane and another run by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority in Canberra. He recommended the amalgamation of all three of those for the reasons that this would improve the degree of communication between each of those organisations, increase our response time and our effectiveness and, as a consequence, increase our capacity to be more successful in search and rescue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This review will be turned into policy. I recently announced that we will be amalgamating all three of our search and rescue operations in Australia. It will cost some $5 million. It will be in place by July of this year. As a consequence of that, we will have a far more effective, quicker to respond and more successful search and rescue service in Australia to assist the Tony Bullimores of the world and anyone else who gets lost in the 11 per cent of the world's surface area that Australia is responsible for in terms of international search and rescue operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude my answer by saying that, whilst Mr Bullimore survived on chocolate bars for the four days in his upturned yacht, there has been considerable interest in him giving endorsement for those chocolate bars. He proposes to do so. The proceeds of those endorsements will go to a charity in Fremantle to benefit parents and children associated with the Royal Australian Navy. It is an excellent gesture by Mr Bullimore, one that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="350"> we can be pleased with.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DG4">Mr TIM FISCHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There has been a very positive reaction to the trade outcomes and objectives statement across the board from a number of industry spokesmen as it gives a good, effective blueprint to pragmatic, hard&hyphen;edge trade negotiating in a world which consists of a very unlevel playing field. In respect of the specific matters that were addressed, they were discussed in a constructive way. Many of those countries, of course, are lowering their own tariff walls, and we are making good progress in our bilateral negotiations as well as in the regional and multilateral setting, but there is a long way to go and I recognise that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was a particular comment made by the United States spokesman, as part of the Outlook conference and parallel with the tabling of the trade outcomes and objectives statement, which said that the single desk selling of the Australian Wheat Board would be under review again and would be taken to the WTO by the United States. I say simply in respect of that: I will defend the right of Australia to decide upon a single desk selling mechanism for the Australian wheat industry or, as maybe required from time to time, with regard to other industries as may be determined by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that my colleague the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, John Anderson, when he met with US Secretary for Agriculture, Dan Glickman, in Rome late last year, took a similar position. He discussed it there. I discussed it with US interlocutors in Manila in the APEC setting and in other settings, and the position is very clear: the United States itself has investigated the Australian wheat industry, most recently by the General Counting Office of the US, which is an independent arm and one of some note. It found that there was absolutely no risk of citing the Australian wheat industry and its single desk selling power to the World Trade Organisation and that there was no subsidy involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further to that, a former senator of the US Congress, Senator Boren, led a subcommittee investigation which made a similar finding. So the single desk selling power in respect of the Australian wheat industry is a mechanism 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="351"> which is fair, which is transparent, which is above board, which helps hard&hyphen;pressed Australian wheat growers who have no subsidy whatsoever to do battle in a very competitive circumstance, and which helped them forge some additional sales in recent weeks to India, Iran and other places in the Middle East and elsewhere&mdash;in fact, almost a record selling program with the huge harvest that they have to deal with at this time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The trade outcomes and objectives statement is a very comprehensive statement.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Fisher for his question. I can assure honourable members of this House that I am acutely aware of the social isolation which afflicts many veterans who live in rural areas, particularly as they become  increasingly frail. Of the 337,000 war widows, veterans and dependents who receive an entitlement from my department, 31 per cent live outside of metropolitan Australia. These people profoundly feel the effects of isolation as they 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="353"> become less mobile and consequently find it very difficult to maintain social contacts with many family and friends.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the initiatives of this government, in partnership with the Australian Red Cross, is the expansion of the Telecross service in the remote Goldfields of Western Australia. This weekend I will be travelling to Kalgoorlie to meet with those wonderful Australian volunteers who man this service through the Australian Red Cross. I will be happy to meet with those people because they do provide a wonderful volunteer service in remote Australia. In essence, Telecross provides a core service to these veterans at the same time every day. That ensures that these people have a human contact each and every day. If the veteran does not answer the telephone, volunteers continue to ring and will visit the home of that person if there is no answer. I am sure this is of great comfort not only to the veterans and the war widows who live in rural and remote parts of Australia but also to their families, who worry so often about their welfare.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me assure you that we understand the needs of the veteran community, wherever its members live in this nation. The funding to be made available to the Australian Red Cross will enable them to expand their Telecross service and train more volunteers in Western Australia. This could well be a model to be extended further across this nation. It is a further demonstration of our commitment to our veterans, wherever they live.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, he got that wrong, too. On 21 January, Senator Woods contacted me and asked to see me. He told me that the police were in the process of, about to, or had executed a search warrant. On 21 January we had a discussion about the matter and he said to me&mdash;and this was the substance of what I repeated on the current affair program earlier this week&mdash;that there was absolutely no substance in the allegations that had been made. I indicated to him that, if any charges were laid against him, he would have to stand aside. He repeated to me that the allegations were unfounded and that he believed that he had done absolutely nothing wrong in relation to things such as travel allowance and the conduct of the accounting and so forth of his office. He understood that the allegations related to those sorts of matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So on 21 January the former parliamentary secretary informed me in some substance. It was the first discussion that he and I had had about the substance of those allegations&mdash;I having previously, as I have acknowledged, been told by the Attorney-General in the latter half of the previous year that a complaint had been made and it having been agreed between us that the law should be allowed to take its course. Can I take this opportunity to say that the important thing about this matter is that the law has been allowed to take its course. If any principle emerges from this, then it is that, under this government, a member of parliament is not to receive favourable treatment to another citizen where an allegation of a breach of law has been made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hold to the view that it would have been entirely improper for me to have informed Senator Woods of the complaint being investigated by the Federal Police. Some may even allege that that would have amounted to inappropriate disclosure of information. Some would even argue that it could have amounted to tipping off Senator Woods about an investigation which could, in certain circumstances, have represented interference with a police investigation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It remains my view that the law should be allowed to run its course. I remind the House 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="354"> of the warning given by the Attorney-General&mdash;that is, a police investigation is still proceeding. Senator Woods, like every other Australian citizen, is entitled to a presumption of innocence. I do not believe that the government's behaviour in this matter or its handling of this matter has been in any way inappropriate. I regret the fact that I inadvertently made an honest error in the interview I gave two nights ago on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Current Affair</EMPHASIS>. I did not set out to mislead the Australian public, I have not given Senator Woods any favourable treatment, I have upheld the code of conduct of my government and I have no apology to make about my handling of this matter.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The ABS has released its average weekly ordinary time earnings figures today. The preliminary estimates show that AWOTE for full-time adult employees increased by 1.2 per cent over the three months to November 1996, after growing by one per cent over the three months to August and by 1.3 per cent over the three months to May. The figures were slightly up on last quarter's figures, although the difference in the annual growth is not statistically significant. There is no doubt that it is a bit towards the top end of market expectations. Whilst the numbers should not be seen as evidence of any acceleration in wages growth, I think the point needs to be made that there is absolutely no room for complacency on this whole question of wages growth in terms of the better economic management of the economy. The fact is there is little substantive evidence of a slowing in enterprise bargaining wage incomes. In some industries, for example in metals, there have been some significant enterprise bargaining wage pressures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bottom line of all this is that I think it reinforces the point that the greatest risk to the wages outlook is the risk posed by the ACTU's living wage case, which is currently before the Industrial Relations Commission. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> If that claim were granted, then that would significantly increase wage costs leading undoubtedly to an increase in the rate of inflation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was very interested in some remarks this morning on the television by the member for Hotham. The ALP thought it was being really clever. The government had an $8 wage increase in its submission to the commission and the ACTU was going for $20. The ALP sent the shadow minister down to the commission and he thought he would be Mr Reasonable in the middle at $14. Apparently this was the ALP's position, which has caused a certain amount of aggravation down at the ACTU headquarters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shadow minister was down there making an application to the commission, but on this morning's television the member for Hotham, who would like to have the Leader of the Opposition's job, thought that he might bring the ACTU to his support by fully substantiating and supporting not his colleague's submission to the commission but the ACTU's submission. So the shadow minister is for $14 and the member for Hotham decided to go for $20. Why? Basically, as usual, his policy is run by the ACTU, and he was there on the TV this morning showing it for all to see.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government's trade priorities are wrong. They are heading in the opposite direction of international trade, they are heading in the opposite direction for Australia's future, and they are heading in the opposite direction for Australian jobs. The subject matter of the MPI refers to the importance to economic and employment growth of Australia increasing its share of world trade in manufactured and value added products.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did we see yesterday in the trade statement tabled by the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer)? We saw the minister's own statement refer to and document the increasing importance of manufacturers in international trade leading to a decline in Australia's share of merchandise exports. What did we also see in the minister's statement tabled yesterday? We saw that the key sectoral priorities, which the statement refers to, are for unprocessed agricultural and mining commodities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, while the whole weight and shift of international trade is in manufactures and value added, the whole shift of the government's priorities is in respect of agricultural and mineral raw materials and commodities. That is the reason why the government's trade priorities are wrong. They would not see an increase of employment and reduction of unemployment so far as Australian jobs are concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister's own report effectively documents that. In his statement yesterday, the minister called on us to carefully examine the detail. I propose to do so and refer the House and the Minister for Trade to chapter 4.4 of his report, from page 25 through to page 27, under the heading `The composition of world and Australian trade'. The minister's own statement yesterday says as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The composition and character of global trade has been undergoing considerable change over the past decade . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The importance of manufactures and services in international trade is increasing. Australia's export composition has changed in line with this global trend (Figure 4.8). Indeed, Australia's move towards manufactures and services exports has been more rapid than that of the rest of the world. That 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> said, primary commodities remain much more significant in Australia's export mix than they do in the rest of the world.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is graphically illustrated by figure 4.8, which shows the shift in international trade and also represents the decline in Australia's share of that trade in the last 20 years or so. The minister's own report goes on to speak in the following terms on page 26:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite the growth of services and manufactures (particularly elaborately transformed manufactures) in Australia's export basket, primary products&mdash;minerals, energy, and agricultural&mdash;remain of great importance to Australia . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is right, and on this side of the House we recognise that. But the key paragraph which follows that says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The share of Australian merchandise exports in world imports (total market share) has declined from around 1.3 per cent in 1989 to 1.1 per cent in 1995.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian exporters have increased their market shares across all major sectors of world trade with the exception of agriculture . . . Yet Australia's total market share has fallen because the composition of world imports has shifted into areas where Australia has a lower total market share.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What does that mean? That means the shift in international trade into manufactures, services and value added products has substantially increased and we run the very grave risk of being left behind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What do we find outlined in the report and statement tabled by the minister yesterday? What are the government's priorities? In the course of his tabling statement, the minister said that the key approach of the government was to pursue bilateral trade relationships. Chapter 10 of the minister's statement tabled yesterday outlines the key markets for trade and investments, outlines prospects and difficulties and outlines the key sectoral areas so far as a number of listed bilaterals are concerned. On page 63 of the minister's own report it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Chapter discusses Australia's key priorities for the next two years in these markets.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The `key priorities for the next two years in these markets'. A number of countries are listed in chapter 10. What do we find about the key sectoral targets and priorities that are 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="357"> listed? I will go through some of the countries referred to in chapter 10: China, India, Indonesia, Japan and Taiwan. The priorities listed for China are wool, fruit, agricultural products and mining&mdash;before you get to manufactures. There are 13 priorities listed for China. It takes until we get to No. 5 before we get into an area where we see the great shift of international trade and where we see the great potential for Australia. In India, wool, mining and coal are listed before we get to manufactures. In Indonesia, fresh fruit, diary and wool are listed before we get to automotive projects. In Japan, beef, rice, diary, quarantine and sugar are listed before we get to professional services. In Taiwan, agriculture, quarantine, beef and horticulture are listed before we get to processed foods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Seeking to improve our performance in all these areas is laudable, but the minister and the government have missed the entire priority. They have missed the great change that the previous government sought to make to Australia's trade performance: reducing our overdependence upon commodities and raw materials and to move into manufactures, value adding and services. Nothing could have let the cat out of the bag better than what the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) said to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> in January: `Anderson backs focus on raw material exports'. In the course of that article, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia should focus more on improving its exports of raw materials rather than developing processing industries, according to the Minister for Primary Industries, Mr Anderson.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"It is likely that improving the quality of our raw materials will become much more important than value&hyphen;adding," Mr Anderson said."</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The very dangerous nature of this approach&mdash;the continuing overdependence upon raw materials in mining, resources and agriculture&mdash;was confirmed only this week by what we saw in the materials released at the ABARE Outlook Conference. `Bleak outlook for rural industry' in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>  on Wednesday and `Low prices kill rural recovery' in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> . What was the ABARE commodity prices report all about? The great danger of a fall in commodity 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> prices so far as our agricultural primary products are concerned and the great dangers so far as a continuing overdependence upon them is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy let the cat out of the bag in the course of January, he effectively said, `This government is hoisting the white flag so far as value adding is concerned, so far as manufactures are concerned and so far as services are concerned.' They were the most regressive trade and industry statements that we have seen from a Howard minister to date. As I said yesterday, Minister Anderson's view predates Black Jack McEwen's. Even Black Jack McEwen had the view that it was possible to have commodity exports in primary and minerals industries and, at the same time, have some form of manufacturing capacity. McEwen had his own way of ensuring a manufacturing capacity, but at least he thought you could have two thoughts in your head at the same time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not the view of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, it is not the view of the government, as expressed in its own report tabled yesterday, and it is contrary to all the evidence and analysis outlined and contained in the government's own report. What the government seeks to do&mdash;courtesy of this great victory in pre&hyphen;McEwen politics and courtesy of policy foisted upon the government by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy&mdash;is to turn the clock back and take away all the effort and all the success that the previous government had in moving to elaborately transformed manufactures and value adding. It is not enough for a continuing dependence upon agricultural and mineral primary products. We have got to be doing the things that the previous government set about: trying to ensure that information technology becomes an export industry for Australia and trying to ensure that industries such as services, telecommunications and other manufacturing products become important in that shift.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That the government should take this approach is not a surprise to us on this side, because we have seen precisely this approach to trade and industry enhancement measures 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="358"> from the moment they came to office. The great potential gains in the areas I have referred to can be made by small and medium sized enterprises. And what are all the programs that this government has set about effectively gutting? All the programs that seek to assist in this area&mdash;EMDG, gutted by $426 million; ITES, abolished; R&amp;D&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was pleased to see that today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> editorial picked up some of these very points. It states in part:</PARA>

It is disappointing, in this context, that the Minister for Primary Industries, Mr Anderson, believes Australia should only focus more on improving the quality of its raw materials exports rather than developing processing industries. It seems silly to suggest Australia should resist the opportunity of vastly increasing export returns through adding value.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">We have not had any clear thinking from the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and, unfortunately, from the Minister for Trade. The very document that he tabled in this House yesterday is the very document 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> which says that the shift in international trade is into manufactures, services and value added items. This shift, which has seen a decline in Australia's market share in international trade, is then ignored and we are pointed in entirely the opposite direction by the bilateral priorities which the minister's key sectoral priorities outline.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We saw the whole thrust of this when the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy let the cat out of the bag in January: this government is essentially concerned with unprocessed primary products processed and is not interested in or concerned about trying to follow the shift in international trade and continuing the good work started by the previous government in moving to elaborately transformed manufactures and valued added items.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy was also reported in his now notorious article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> in January as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Asian economies were likely to shift more intensively into manufacturing and value&hyphen;adding activities as regional trade was liberalised in the Asia Pacific Economic Co&hyphen;operation region . . . This would lessen Australia's competitiveness in these areas while at the same time greatly boosting Asian demand for unprocessed raw materials which Australia could readily supply.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The minister has that entirely wrong on two points. Firstly, he is putting up the white flag for Australian producers and manufacturers and essentially saying that we are incapable of competing in our own region. Secondly, he has missed the point&mdash;that with an increasing consumer appetite in Asia, Asia is now becoming a great marketplace for consumer items, therefore becoming a great marketplace for value added items, therefore becoming a great marketplace for the sorts of things which Australian industry, with the assistance of proper government policy, can develop and export in greater quantities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous government started the shift to more Australian trade in manufactures and elaborately transformed manufactures. What we saw yesterday is consistent with the regressive view of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy: a move away from continuing that development, a continuing 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="359"> overdependence upon commodity prices. If we do that, we go in the opposite direction to the shift in international trade and we take Australia in the opposite direction of its future, and we take it, by way of government policy, in the opposite direction of exports when increased exports would see Australian jobs increased and unemployment reduced. This government is heading Australia in the wrong direction, and doing that is a great tragedy for Australia's unemployed.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very glad that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Trade outcomes and objectives statement</EMPHASIS>  has achieved many things but one in particular this afternoon, and that is that we have a matter of public importance on trade. I understand the battles of a junior shadow minister trying to get these subjects up. The member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) tried once last year and was knocked off.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important that the whole profile of the trade issue be focused on in here, the highest forum in the land. That is why at the last election the coalition gave a commitment to produce a comprehensive annual statement on trade, one which will be benchmarked and returned to. That is why I was particularly delighted at the start of the parliamentary session for 1997 to produce and table that comprehensive statement, to make an additional ministerial statement and to allow a proper discussion and debate on trade at the highest level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have always been interested in the role that the member for Perth has played over the years, not just as a member but in the inner loop of the office of former Prime Minister Keating. During the summer recess I finally got around to, in addition to climbing Mount Kosciusko and doing one or two other things, reading the account by Edwards of the Keating prime ministership.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="SMITH" NAMEID="5V5">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DG4">Mr TIM FISCHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a nice, communicable gesture. I am glad the honourable member was gainfully engaged in doing some reading as well. I happened to find in that book a very interesting statement. You can just see the scene: another big argument 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> about trade and tariffs was taking place in the Prime Minister's office when suddenly Senator Button came bursting through the door. They got bogged down in a discussion which ran late because former Prime Minister Keating was never punctual&mdash;that is confirmed in the book time and again; I do not know why you did not make sure the Prime Minister was on time more often when you worked in that office&mdash;and then suddenly, in the heat of the moment during this lengthy discussion, came a plea of desperation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did Minister Button, that very senior minister, say in that very inner loop of government? He said this: `Down there at DFAT they have over 80 people on the multilaterals, but how many have they got on the bilaterals?' Why is it that Labor walked away from the bilateral effort? Why is it that they had no case workers getting on with the task of negotiating and exercising negotiating coin to gain better market access on the bilaterals?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We on this side have the capacity to do all three: to pursue an integrated approach which sees more effort with the bilaterals, to continue efforts with the regional trade negotiations through the APEC process and the breakthroughs we have achieved at the multilateral level and to build on work commenced in part by former trade ministers on both sides of politics culminating in the Singapore ministerial declaration in December last year&mdash;just two months ago&mdash;reflecting a great effort on the multilaterals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am just delighted that we have fulfilled this election commitment with the tabling of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Trade outcomes and objectives statement</EMPHASIS>. The fact that this is the first ever comprehensive statement to parliament on trade policy demonstrates our determination to ensure trade policy is more actively used in pursuing our national interest. It brings to trade policy new standards of transparency and accountability, and it sets out our approach of an integrated trade policy framework which has already delivered to Australian exporters some very significant breakthroughs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I welcome the fact that there was one other admission by the member for Perth yesterday. He said, `Of course Minister McMullan'&mdash;the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="360"> member for Canberra&mdash;`went around making statements and of course there were publications authorised and cleared by the minister and presumably he read them.' But at no stage, he admitted, did the government pull this all together to produce some form of comprehensive benchmarking or comprehensive statement. Amen to that. We have; you did not. I welcome the fact that he quoted at some length from the statement, describing parts of it as laudable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to now deal with the particular matters raised. First, in respect of comments that have been made in part by the United States, the Australian&hyphen;United States bilateral relationship is a very important one. It is in very good shape. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has met with President Clinton. There have been high level senior ministerial talks throughout last year, and these will continue throughout this year. I have had lengthy and numerous dialogue meetings with Charlene Barshefsky, the US trade representative. Progress is being made on matters of concern on both sides of the ledger.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the matter of the Australian wheat industry, I confirm that this was investigated and a report was produced in June 1996 by the US General Accounting Office. It concluded that there was no basis for finding that the Australian Wheat Board is an unfair trader. The single desk capacity of the Australian Wheat Board and the Australian wheat industry is legitimate sovereign policy to be exercised by the Australian government, and it is one we are much more strongly about than the federal Labor government was in its period of office where it kept changing its attitude to it. It is one that I and my colleague the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) will defend as he looks and reviews aspects of the structure of the wheat industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He also signals that, if these matters can be brought forward, Australia would be interested in looking at credit arrangements with regard to exports of the United States's wheat crop. I think this is one area where, at the end of the day, there will be a considerable and considered understanding reached. As the great Australian wheat industry, which makes 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> such a great export contribution to Australia's trade performance, looks at different structures and the like, they might be wise to consider the fact that some of the options would involve trusts and other mechanisms which are not easily traded. Others would involve more commonly used and more commercially valuable shares to land&hyphen;holders and wheat growers. They ought to be considered very carefully indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are matters which the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy is pursuing in order to get the best structure for the Australian wheat industry for the year 2000 and beyond. That does not in any way cut across his absolute commitment to value adding. He confirmed that commitment on the floor of the House yesterday. I strongly defend his statement that he supports value adding, and that is best done where there is comparative advantage for Australia. Indeed, I quote exactly from the minister's answer to the contention put by the member for Perth:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a misrepresentation of my position. I make it plain now, as I always have, that we must pursue value adding opportunities wherever we can.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I hope that the member for Perth will take absolute note of that statement by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and that that is the end of this particular matter. In the same way that you do not take responsibility for your reportage and the misrepresentation that may occur from time to time, this is a matter where this has happened. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy made a declaration at this dispatch box just a day ago&mdash;and he made it very clearly&mdash;that he supports value adding where it helps.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He went on to make a very good point. He said that what the federal Labor government was about was a great deal of value subtracting in respect of their economic performance&mdash;value minusing. He talked about a situation in the meat industry where the cost overhead structure was such that we faced the prospect of Sizzlers and other chains of restaurants importing beef from the United States because it would have been cheaper landed and delivered in Sydney, Albury and Melbourne than Australian beef would be. It 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="361"> is a disgraceful circumstance. It is the outcome of years of value subtracting policies when you get down to the detail of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will not dwell on that, other than to turn to the waterfront and point out the exactitude of Labor's performance in that area by giving one very good example. P&amp;O Australia are the managing agents for Botany Bay container port. They also happen to be the same company that are the managing agents for a temporary container port in Buenos Aires, Argentina.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of Buenos Aires, Argentina, they had two years to develop a temporary site. They did not have the best of equipment and they were in a cramped area&mdash;an old finger wharf setting&mdash;but they got their act together. This time last year they were, on a benchmark rate, shifting containers at between 35 and 40 containers an hour. On the same benchmarking, what was happening back in Botany Bay where you have permanent hard standing, state&hyphen;of&hyphen;the&hyphen;art crane equipment, a rail connection par excellence and a dual carriageway suburban arterial road connection par excellence? On a good day, 15 containers an hour. Now you start to see why we are genuine in saying that the Labor years were about value subtracting in overheads and costs faced by our exporters and industry generally and why we are truly about value adding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One other point was made by the member for Perth which I think needs to be corrected for the record. It was the only specific criticism he turned up with regard to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Trade outcomes and objectives statement</EMPHASIS>&mdash;and he is quietly furious that his side never got around to doing one in its 13 years of government. I refer to the matter of Mexican wool tariffs. I said all along that there were breakthroughs over time and they came in two stages, and this is what the shadow minister forgets. Yes, back in January of last year there was a movement with regard to wool tops&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="SMITH" NAMEID="5V5">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just a movement.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DG4">Mr TIM FISCHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There was a reduction to zero in regard to wool tops. But it was in January this year that further action was taken. I quote from a cable from a meeting on these matters which I had in my capacity as 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Minister for Trade well after the Labor Party had left government. The cable states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Fischer subsequently raised the matter of noils and waste at the second meeting of the JTIC in Canberra in June 1996 and received assurances from Mexican Trade Minister Blanco that the exemption would be referred to Mexico's Foreign Trade Commission with a favourable recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We have been following up regularly since then and our efforts have now achieved the results we wanted. It has been an effort to bring about the final reduction which was designed with regard to wool noils and waste, and that has commenced from 1 January 1997. It was gazetted in December by the Mexican government. I thank the Mexico government for their clear-cut decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mr Stephen Smith interjecting</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DG4">Mr TIM FISCHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What you do not realise is that there were two types: firstly, wool tops, a reduction which took place under you; and, separate to that, wool noils and wool wastes. These are quite properly claimed as being part of a win-win situation for the wool industry and the opening up of a Mexican wool pipeline of considerable value to industry&mdash;and detailed well enough in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Trade outcomes and objectives statement</EMPHASIS> .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to say in very clear-cut terms that the Australian coalition government has been in office for some 10 months and it has been and is a very busy period. We have dealt with a number of key issues, some emerging from left field and others having been left to us by the outgoing federal Labor government, most particularly the budget deficit circumstances, the Beazley black hole&mdash;a fact they had not addressed and something they were warned of repeatedly. Indeed, it was revealed in very categorical terms in that same book on Keating which came out after the 1993 election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, they just failed to cut the mustard in getting the budget back towards a surplus, notwithstanding periods of economic growth. That was something we had to rectify. We had to rectify it in the interests of exporters and we had to rectify it in the interests of providing a lower interest rate framework for small, medium and large 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="362"> business. This matter of trade policy cannot be divorced from the domestic circumstance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yes, there have been adjustments to the export market development grants scheme. I might add that, in terms of the budget announcement there, the tourist industry is to be lifted to a full rate of export market development grant&mdash;something Labor never did. We have proceeded with the lifting of the tourist industry to a full rate of EMDG. We are providing assistance whilst constrained by the budgetary circumstance we inherited from the federal Labor government. We are moving to close up that deficit. We are providing a framework which has lowered interest rates. We are still continuing with the export market development grants scheme, but making it a simpler, more effective scheme and one less able to be rorted, because I am not interested in providing grants under the EMDG scheme for people who are not exporting but simply lifting the money out of the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that after two days the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Trade outcomes and objectives statement</EMPHASIS> walks tall. When it is circulated widely, it will do so even more. It is a very good and comprehensive first effort in finally bringing the whole issue of trade to this, the highest forum in the land. I thank those in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and elsewhere who greatly helped in the compilation of this statement. But, more particularly, I look forward to further breakthroughs on the trade policy market access front. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a reference to you, Minister, rather than to the Mexican minister: Minister Blank, the Minister for Trade from Australia. It is an important time for this MPI to come before the parliament because we had 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a pretty weak effort yesterday by the Minister for Trade on trade matters, and we have had an even weaker one today. We had the situation yesterday where the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) was even more pathetic in his attempts to wiggle off the problem he has caused for himself with his comments about Australian's dependence on commodity trade. It is an important time for this discussion because it comes a couple of days after the report by the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics that forecasts commodity prices into the future and shows the stupidity of the approach that has been outlined by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The debate also comes after the government has continued its approach of slash and burn on the range of important policies that were put in place by the previous government to ensure that value added exports, manufactured exports, particularly elaborately transformed manufactured exports, were matters that were getting the attention they needed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After all, those areas of world trade are the most rapidly growing aspects of world trade. They are the areas where Australia really has to increasingly make its mark if it is to survive in a very competitive world. Those areas which the government has knocked off completely are DIFF and the trade enhancement programs. We have already heard from the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) about export market development grants and the cuts that have occurred there. We are all aware in this House of the attack by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) on the importance of research and development. We have seen the threats to the car industry and the pharmaceutical industry. We are aware of the attacks that the government has made on bounties on various important components of our manufacturing and value added effort.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Appropriately, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> today is carrying a story on a report that the government has from consultants on the competitiveness of Australia in the rapidly growing area of world trade: information technology. President Clinton, I think to his credit, has achieved very significant reform and liberalisation of information technology trade 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="363"> internationally. What does this report say about Australia? The most fundamental thing is its criticism of Australian government industry policies which are simply not competitive&mdash;this is the government's own report&mdash;with governments such as the United Kingdom, Ireland, Singapore and Malaysia. The report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia is only getting a tiny share of internationally mobile foreign direct investment in electronics and other information industry sectors . . . Yet the Asia&hyphen;Pacific rim is now the focus of more than 45 per cent of global electronic production and is receiving more than 60 per cent of new investment in the strategically crucial semi&hyphen;conductor fabrication activity.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is precisely the point which the minister missed of the MPI introduced by the member for Perth: under this government, Australia is simply not being competitive&mdash;and it has been told so by its own reports&mdash;and does not have the appropriate policies in place to address areas that are critically important in the growth of world trade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The debate also comes at a time when we had the mid&hyphen;year economic and fiscal outlook forecast by the Treasurer, which presented a revised net export contribution to GDP growth of a negative quarter of a per cent&mdash;that is, net exports are a negative factor on our economy in the context where we desperately need that contribution to our economy to create the jobs that we, as Australians, all need. So it is singly important that this parliament devote considerable attention to this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Without unduly confusing the House, I do not often quote Malcolm Fraser in positive ways&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. Malcolm Fraser, when he is not masquerading as an Easter Island granite platform and scaring tourists to those places, occasionally writes articles to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> . In an article that he wrote that impressed me back in January he made the following comments:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Shortly before Christmas the sugar industry was served notice that it would lose all import protection by the middle of this year. The Productivity Commission report on the automotive industry recommends that tariffs be reduced to 5 per cent. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The report goes on to discuss sugar and that, perhaps, should be the subject of further debate. On the automotive area, he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the automotive industry we have a similar circumstance. East and South&hyphen;East Asian countries producing motor cars do so under very heavy protection, running to quotas and to tariffs up to 200 per cent. They do this because they are determined to expand their own industries. The US limits the import of Japanese cars to 16 per cent of the domestic market and has a 25 per cent duty on light commercial vehicles. The Europeans limit the importation of Japanese cars to 8 per cent of the European Union's market.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Where is the recognition of this uneven playing field? The Australian car industry, picking one example, is currently subject to debate because of the attention the Productivity Commission is giving it. Where does this reflect itself in the report that this government has presented? One of the very few references, which I frankly think is somewhat bizarre in the report that the minister tabled yesterday in the context of Japan, our major trading partner, was where he said `there are no specific barriers of concern to Australia in the context of auto and auto parts'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One does not have to be a regular reader of the financial press, including today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, to realise that there are massive problems in relation to barriers to access, particularly from the US, to Japanese auto markets and auto component markets. We have a situation where we are simply not on a level playing field. Our automotive manufacturers are facing a situation, driven by blind ideology in the absence of an industry plan of the sort that the previous government had under the Button car plan with its focus on exports, where those crucial links between further trade liberalisation&mdash;which the former government embarked on&mdash;and progress being made by trading partners and of proper industry policy development are simply being missed by this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a range of other areas in this report that we had from the minister yesterday which shows lack of substance. We have references in the report to the importance of this year being the Year of South Asia, yet our Prime Minister (Mr Howard), in what could have been an immensely symbolic gesture, simply 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="364"> failed to go to India despite the expectations of the Indian authorities. It is good to see the member for Aston (Mr Nugent) in the chamber because he, along with me, is aware of the importance of that market. I think we are also aware of the importance the Indian authorities were placing on Australia's involvement in it and the opportunities that would have been presented if the Prime Minister had attended, but he simply failed in that important symbolic gesture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a pretty wimpy response in the report to the United States&mdash;our second largest market but also, frankly, our most difficult, given the trade imbalance that exists. We are aware of the `roll over on your tummy and scratch me' approach that the government has taken to the United States efforts on the Howe Leather matter. This minister has failed singly to sort out the problem that Australia's biggest company, BHP, is facing in its project with Iran and Pakistan because of the US seeking, in an extraterritorial way, to apply its law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what does the minister do? He takes the big stick out to Hungary&mdash;Hungary of all countries. I am sure in Budapest they are absolutely terrified of this threat, this aggressive bilateralism and attack on Hungary, by this government in international forums.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I make my comments specifically, I would like to respond to some of the comments made by the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) and the previous speaker, the member for Maribyrnong (Mr Sercombe). I suppose I have to extend some sympathy to the two opposition speakers because they are really scratching to find anything of substance to talk about. We have produced a very meaty document&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Trade outcomes and objectives 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> statement</EMPHASIS> &mdash;and all they can do is scratch a bit around the edges.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that the member for Perth, for example, really did not have any significant criticisms to make. We got down to looking at some of the tables of priorities. He suggested to this House that the tables under the various country headings had as key priorities agricultural and primary industry matters. Any cursory reading of the document&mdash;let alone a deep reading, which you would have expected from the shadow minister for trade&mdash;would demonstrate quite clearly that those tables are not meant to be in priority order. They are laid out to a format.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, if you read the footnote to each of those tables, and I draw the shadow minister's attention in particular to page 72 of the report, you will find it says very clearly&mdash;and this is repeated at every single set of tables&mdash;`For reasons of commercial confidentiality and the protection of Australia's negotiating position, this column contains only some selective desired outcomes'. It is not in priority sequence&mdash;it makes no claim to be&mdash;yet we heard at least five minutes of drivel from the gentleman from Perth about the fact that we had got the wrong priority order. It is just a straight distortion. That is unfortunately something we have come to expect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also heard something about the EMDG scheme and the changes to that scheme. But, of course, he did not talk about the very constructive things, which organisations like Austrade are standing up and applauding, we are doing by starting to change that scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He quoted from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>. If I have time, I will do some of my own quoting from today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>. He also spent a lot of time attacking the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) for putting primary industries first. I would have thought that that was very much the role of the minister. The Minister for Trade and the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Fischer) has given us a very balanced approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the member for Maribyrnong said, I spent a week or so with him in India last year looking at a number of these matters. I was disappointed that he felt it necessary to open 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="365"> his speech not in any constructive and positive way, which I think people would like to see conducted in this House, but in a way which resorted to trivial abuse of the minister. He talked about Minister Blanko and all that sort of thing. It does him and his side of this chamber no credit at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the competitiveness of industries like Australian information technology, which does have a number of major problems, I draw the honourable gentleman's attention to the fact that this government has been here for 10 months. Those problems have not occurred just in the last 10 months; they have occurred over the last 15 years. What we are talking about is the legacy of the 13 years or so of the previous government's administration. People in glasshouses really are not in a position to throw stones.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are of course good opportunities in India. It was unfortunate the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) was not able to go. The Deputy Prime Minister and a number of other ministers went. Only this morning I received a briefing from Austrade, which was extremely positive on the outcome of that new horizons program in India.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me remind the House that in this matter of public importance we are talking about `The importance to economic and employment growth of Australia increasing its share of world trade in manufactured and valued added products.' We might also add `services' to that statement and it would be a general statement that most people would obviously agree with. Australia certainly has outstanding opportunities in many countries in the health field, the education field, the environmental management field and a whole range of other fields.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thought there was a very interesting item on the front page of this morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> written by Greg Sheridan, the foreign editor. In reporting on this document, which has been the subject of discussion this afternoon, Greg Sheridan wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">ONE statistic from Tim Fischer's trade statement yesterday is more eloquent than the rest of the 200 pages put together.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And it is a very important statement. He continued: </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It tells you everything you really need to know about Australia's trade performance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Between 1989 and 1995&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">and I would remind the House that that was when the Labor Party was in government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's exports as a share of global imports declined from 1.3 per cent to 1.1 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In other words, Australia is a nation of declining relevance in global trade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite all the changes of the past decade&hyphen;and&hyphen;a&hyphen;half, despite all the increase in Australian exports, our exports are still growing more slowly than global exports. We are falling further and further behind. We may have changed more rapidly than at any time in our past, but the cruel facts are that we have not changed fast enough to keep up with the demands of the global economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our trade performance is poor and we will have less ability to control our own economic destiny as a result.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is the legacy that the previous government left to this government, and that is what we are trying to fix up. It is the sort of legacy that they do not like to talk about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it becomes a bit rich when the gentleman from Perth stands in here and criticises us for our poor performance and quotes how badly we are doing in the world when he, as either a member of the previous government or a senior adviser in the office of the Prime Minister of the previous government, was an integral member of that government's bequeathing to this country of this quite appalling state of affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would now like to refer to this document <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Trade outcomes and objectives statement</EMPHASIS> which was tabled yesterday by the Minister for Trade. If one turns, for example, to chapter 10, one very quickly has an opportunity to see many of the opportunities that are here. The gentleman from Perth was complaining that we were preoccupied with primary industry. I draw his attention to page 65 of the document which deals with China. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In recent years, manufactures exports, such as high&hyphen;speed ferries, optical fibre cable, and telecommunications equipment have increased.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We have in fact been moving in that direction and we are starting to make further changes in the things that we are advocating in this report. We have listed in the annexe to that section, on page 72, a whole list of key areas 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="366"> where we are going to put priorities over the next couple of years. It is not only in the wool area and the fruit area, important as those are, but also in manufactures, automotive components and a number of service areas such as banking, legal and insurance, telecommunications, education, engineering and accounting. There is a vast opportunity in China.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Equally, there is a vast opportunity in Hong Kong. A number of members of this House, including those from the other side, were in Hong Kong a couple of weeks ago on other matters but, as a by&hyphen;product, we were able to see some of the outstanding work being performed overseas by Australian companies and taking advantage of those opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If one goes on through this report&mdash;and there is not time to go through every chapter&mdash;and turns to the section, for example, on Indonesia, it talks not just about agricultural products but very clearly about major ETM exports, including processed metals, machinery, building products, transport equipment and electrical products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One could say exactly the same sort of thing in respect of Malaysia. I have had the pleasure of being in Malaysia in the last few months and I know that the Prime Minister intends to go there some time this year. He will see at first&hyphen;hand, in talking to companies in Malaysia, the outstanding opportunities that we are starting to create. This government is all about putting in place the infrastructure and the opportunities for Australian companies to get out there and take advantage of that situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things that this government has done is to undertake major restructuring of Austrade so that it is more responsive to the areas of need of Australian companies that want to get into overseas business&mdash;not just the big companies but also the small companies. I could go on to talk about Japan, Korea, Singapore and a whole range of others, but perhaps I could conclude by again quoting from Greg Sheridan at the conclusion of his article this morning in which he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is . . . part of the ongoing process of educating&mdash; 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">he is talking about trade liberalisation and trade outcomes&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australians about the overriding importance of trade to their future. But the bottom line is the bottom line. Australia is a very small part of world trade. And it is getting smaller. And that's bad news.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is right. That is what we inherited from the Labor Party and that is what this government is all about fixing up. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I only intend to take a few more moments of the time of the House on this matter. The Charter of Budget Honesty Bill is a very important bill. It will very much enhance the discipline, transparency, accountability and openness which apply to the conduct of government in this country, particularly during the hurly-burly of elections. In the past&mdash;most recently at the last election&mdash;we often saw governments of the day holding back the true picture as far as the books were concerned. When I commenced my remarks before question time I quite clearly made the point this is simply not good enough. The books we as parliamentarians are talking about are not ours to control and conceal; they are matters which we deal with because of the trust placed in us by the Australian people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of this bill, governments will be required to factor in the medium&hyphen; and long&hyphen;term impact of their fiscal policies and reveal 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> them to Australians so they can also plan their role in the economy. It is not just the short-term impact of government policies we are dealing with here. It was certainly the increasing practice of the previous failed Labor administration. This bill means fiscal policy will incorporate short-term issues, such as cyclical economic downturns, while recognising there is a great importance in medium&hyphen;term issues, such as the sustainability of government debt and government saving, matters which obviously, as the various election cycles through the 1980s proved, the previous government simply chose to ignore between elections and hide at election times.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have always believed in open, honest and accountable government. I think it is a basic tenet which most people in this place always seek to uphold. Put simply, if a government is doing its job properly it should never be afraid to open up the books which it administers. As a member of the Liberal Party from Queensland, I appreciate the sacrifice of some who have gone before me, particularly those members in the state parliament such as Ian Prentice and Guelf Scassola, who back in 1983 moved for a public accounts committee in the Queensland state parliament. They wanted the people to know back then what was happening in the books in the state of Queensland. Those people and those who supported them were proved right in the long term, even though they were unfairly judged at an election which followed soon after their moving of suspension of standing orders in an attempt to try to convene the public accounts committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I guess it is a case of being wise after the act. If the public accounts committee system had begun to operate from 1983 onwards in Queensland, perhaps a lot of the political fallout which came out of the Fitzgerald inquiry process may never have eventuated. I think all in this place would agree&mdash;the Fitzgerald inquiry unfortunately become evidence confirming the very worst thoughts of a lot of people in this country about politicians. Yet it could have been averted if there had been a system of openness, honesty and accountability in place.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="368">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here in the federal parliament matters of openness, honesty and accountability are very well exercised but are now going to be even further enhanced as a result of this bill. The sums involved in the situations involving members of parliament in Queensland are totally insignificant when you compare them with the sums which have been involved most recently in the failure of the previous government to disclose the true picture of the books. This failure was perpetrated in particular by the current Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) when he was finance minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are plenty of newspaper clippings in the parliamentary library within this building which can prove this point, so I will not labour the point in this House any longer. But one thing is certain&mdash;such disregard for the views of average Australians and such disregard for allowing average Australians to know just how well or otherwise the stewardship of the books has been conducted should never occur again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those sorts of reasons, this bill is very important. It really is a matter of trust. It is a matter of raising the standard. This is one of the key themes of this Howard government. This bill will also give greater certainty to average Australians. They will be able to plan beyond the election cycle. They will be able to understand the government is not simply looking at what will keep them in office next time around but is, in fact, looking at the medium and longer term as well as the short&hyphen;term cycles. Let us face it, when an election is called, all too often it kills off economic activity. We cannot allow it to be a continuing cycle in this country any longer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most of all, this bill will ensure all in this place and those in the other place lift their game. With the books wide open, it is quite simple&mdash;we cannot hide the facts. People will be able to see just how well we have conducted government in this country on behalf of the people of Australia. For all those reasons, there is no doubt this bill will be very well received in the Australian community. I commend it to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This has been an interesting debate on the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill. It has 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> been interesting to hear parliamentarians on the government side in speaking to legislation about a charter of budget honesty being so dishonest. The dishonesty from almost every speaker opposite that I have heard or in every speech that I have read has been amazing. Just now a reference to newspaper reports in the last election implied that the then government knew the Treasury estimates. The whole argument has been based on the fact that the government knew the figures and would not release them. They know that that is not true. But in 1983 John Howard did know.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We did not see Ted Evans come forward last year and say, `I told the Treasurer the figure,' as John Stone did in 1983. In 1983, John Stone, the Secretary to the Treasury, came forward publicly and confirmed that he had advised the then Treasurer prior to the election of the $9.6 billion budget deficit in prospect. That is $25 billion in today's terms. Ted Evans has not done the same.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This whole argument has been hung on such a dishonest principle. They preach to us piously about budget honesty. Almost every speaker was saying the same thing. The member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) was fascinating. He talked about the $200 billion foreign debt and then said that $100 billion of it is the government's. How dishonest can you get?

The member for Lyne, as I said, talked about a $200 billion foreign debt and then said that $100 billion of it is the government's. He knows that is wrong. We all know that is wrong. What kind of honesty can we expect from those opposite when they do that?</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="369">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been constant references to the report of the Joint Parliamentary Committee of Public Accounts. Some members opposite have said that the previous government ignored the recommendations. The report was tabled on 29 November 1995&mdash;in the last weeks of the last parliament. Who do you think you are kidding?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By the way, as members now know&mdash;those who are new may not have known before but will now understand&mdash;parliamentary inquiries require ministerial consent. In other words, the previous Treasurer, the previous government, endorsed that inquiry. It was chaired by a Labor parliamentarian and had a majority of government members. In other words, the Labor government was encouraging further evolution of the reporting system. But some of the key elements of the committee's recommendations have been dropped, some of the really important ones which were about honesty&mdash;for example, the ones about the figures being vetted by the departments, not by the Treasury.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that we have just seen a review come forward which we know is shonky. It is as shonky as the last budget of the now Prime Minister. We all know that growth will not be the figure that has been projected in the budget and restated in the review. This Treasury review came through the Treasurer's office. It has been fiddled. The Treasurer could not fiddle some of the projections, but he fiddled the others to try to lessen his own little deficit.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am very aware of the language. I am very aware of all the claims and accusations made by those opposite over the last 11 months and particularly during this debate. The Treasurer has the option of being in here but, quite frankly, if I were him I would not waste my time because this is such a lightweight exercise. The real key, which came forward from the parliamentary committee, was the distinction between the political office and the departmental office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee wanted and recommended that the figures being put forward be not vetted by the Treasurer. That has not been adopted. In fact, the Treasurer has kept the fix in for himself. What the Labor Party wanted on that committee has not been agreed to, yet those opposite have not only lambasted us for not adopting the recommendations in the report, which was tabled in the last weeks of the last parliament, but also gutted some of the key elements of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whether or not history is important, there were two fascinating things about 1982 and 1983. The first one was the deficit in 1983, but the more interesting one was the last Howard budget of August 1982 when the unemployment figures for the whole year had already been exceeded by the time they were actually tabled. That budget was so shonky. Go back and look at the figures and see how much it blew out by and look at the speech that was made at the time they were tabled. By the time they were tabled the figures were already out of date. The then Treasurer, the now Prime Minister, came into this parliament with a budget which was as shonky as any of all time. He made Phil Lynch's rubbery figures look like they were casts of steel. That was the last budget of the last Liberal government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have improved. This time your figures have taken five months to be out, but back in 1983 they were out by the time you tabled 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="370"> them. When I say that the figures in this current budget review are false, the fact is that the Reserve Bank has made it pretty clear in its comments that it knew retail sales were down and the Treasurer in his remarks made it clear that he knew retail sales were down. The growth figures for the last quarter of the calendar year, the December quarter, may be negative. They may not, but it will be very close to zero. Therefore, the projected budget growth of 3&frac14; per cent is not going to happen. We know that. We have known that for months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet in the budget review what did you focus on? `That rotten Treasury; they have given us bad forecasts.' Welcome to the world. Go and look at the forecasts in the last budget of the previous government. Go and look at the forecasts of every budget. There is a difference between the Treasurer's office fiddling, massaging and printing the figures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you were so genuine about your concern, change the legislation so the Treasurer's office cannot interfere. If you are so concerned, get the Treasurer's fingers out of this process. If you are so concerned, make it come from Treasury and the Reserve Bank alone, not from the Treasurer's office. We have heard so much about honesty. I think today of all days it is ironic that we are debating this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does this whole business actually mean? We have seen the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) admitting, almost hourly, to having misled the parliament and the public. We have seen the Prime Minister admitting that things get forgotten. `To the best of my recollection' is now stamped across the Prime Minister's forehead forever and a day. What is wrong with his memory? His short-term memory is disastrous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about the honesty of this whole budget approach. We are all being inundated with responses from constituents. You are being inundated as much as I am. I had a case as recently as today of a person losing social security benefits. Fortunately, he came to me. Fortunately, he actually got up and complained. This man was supposed to receive a letter in the mail. Because he had not responded to the letter, he was cut off benefits. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> He has got no money. It is just gone. This man had worked for the last 15 years. His employment record is superb. He is not someone who has been a long-term beneficiary. After hours of argument and checking, this afternoon the department finally acknowledged that the letter was not sent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You are all getting complaints related to Austudy. We are; you are. You are all getting social security complaints. You all know that we are being inundated. What is the cost of that? What is the cost of what you are doing? Can you put a dollar figure on that man's angst today? Can you put a cost on what we are doing to the community out there with all these supposed savings and all this supposed honesty?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People think honesty means being open, not fiddling around with numbers. What you have told the world is that people on the dole are all bludgers.

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="371"> people were not voting on economic crisis, but now they have got one. You talked the economy down. The government has frightened people enormously and is now trying to jawbone them into spending their money because it has got them so terrified.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's attempt to justify its own ideology has led it into the greatest trap of all&mdash;the use of fear to attack their opponents. In doing that, you have to recognise that people will listen to you. They think, `If it is so bad, I should worry.' They have worried and they have been worrying ever since. They were not worried about the future in March of last year, but they are worrying about it now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People have cut spending and confidence is down. All the business investment in the world is not going to solve that because the fact is, as you well know, Mr Deputy Speaker, coming from South Australia, that an awful lot of our investment now is going into the mining industry. The more we invest in mining, the fewer jobs there are. Our mining exports have grown by 128 per cent over the last 12 years or so while the work force has gone down by 10 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are speaking about this wonderful government and the honesty of it all! Let us look at the change in job numbers and the confidence of the community. In 1982, when the now Prime Minister was Treasurer, the decline in the manufacturing work force was eight per cent. In one year under John Howard, eight per cent of people working in manufacturing lost their jobs. That is an amazing figure. Yet we are now being lectured by the same man, who wants to talk about honesty. Has he ever admitted to that? Has he ever owned up to what he did and to why he was then so unpopular? Honesty is not simply about fiscal matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen gross dishonesty in relation to the aged care system with the idea that up-front fees would somehow generate more money rather than less, to mask the half a billion dollars in cuts in capital grants. You all know this now because I do not doubt that nursing homes and hostels in the constituencies of honourable members are now coming forward, telling members what the facts are and what this is going to do to their hostels 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and nursing homes. I am getting it. I do not doubt that other members of parliament are as well. That is dishonest. The implication was that it was going to attract $130 million worth of investment in aged care services, in residential services. It is not. It never was going to. That was always dishonest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ones who have been hurt most viciously in recent days are young Australians. The Austudy cases I am getting are mind blowing. I am just tearing my hair out. We saw the minister today washing his hands of the issue. I could not believe the absolute dishonesty of that approach. He was washing his hands of the matter saying, `We have put all these people on the phone lines.' Fat lot of use that is! People are being told that it is going to take three months for their cases to be reviewed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know of a case of a single parent asked to take into account all her spending for the next year, including income from all sources. Knowing that she qualifies for Austudy, of course she included the Austudy income in the figure, as she would have to do in all honesty. Guess what? That rules her out of Austudy. She thought, `That must be a mistake&mdash;a simple clerical mistake.' Can we get that corrected? No, we cannot. It has to go to Canberra for review, and they are taking up to three months because there are something like 20,000 cases the same. That is honesty for you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Look across the board at young Australians, whom we had all that campaigning about. There was the youth bus up the coast, all those meetings and thousands of young Australians turning out to indicate that they wanted to have confidence in the coalition. What has the government done to them? The government has shifted the Austudy age of independence to 25, so anybody starting a university course under 25 whose parents' income disqualifies them from Austudy will never get it. That is the first thing. The government also made the means test apply to young Australians on jobsearch until they are 21. In other words, they under parental responsibility until they are 21.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also changed the Austudy rules. It is not about helping them; it is about saying that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="372"> they are all cheating. The implication all the way through this is that everybody is a cheat, a liar, a fraud and a crook. They are guilty so they have to prove their innocence. Members of the government all know this because they are all getting the complaints that we are getting and they are hurting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time there is increased HECS funding so we are seeing people suddenly moving away from studying sciences. In the parliament this week the Prime Minister made an absolute fool of himself with regard to the comments of the Victorian Minister for Education. He did not realise that the Victorian minister had, in fact, accurately projected that the HECS increases were causing a decline in science enrolments. They have cut university funding as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is great confidence in young Australians. The future of the country is being gutted. They are being told, `We will not support you. There is no place for you. You are still under your parents' control and your parents' income.' What is more, they are being told, `Your parents are cheating.' That is what they are being told. This is terrific stuff!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then members of the government start talking about us when we were in government. I just cannot believe the dishonesty that is involved. For them to get up there and start lecturing about budget honesty! Budget honesty is about telling people what you mean to do and what you are actually doing. The idea of cloaking it all in numbers and fiscal rectitude and so on is a load of codswallop because, as far as the people out there are concerned, budgets and those things are not what affect them. They are affected by your policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are being blatantly dishonest in what you are doing and are then pretending that it is all about these projections, people might believe it for the first few months, but already they are realising that your projections are not all that good anyway&mdash;the ones you attacked us for in the last couple of years. The $3 billion deficit we are just seeing emerging will be bigger and bigger because you are killing the economy.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When speaking in this place it is sometimes easy to forget that there are people out there listening to the radio broadcast of parliament. They may be in their cars, in their lounge rooms, at work or sitting on the beach on a warm sunny Australian afternoon. I know that a few of our mums and dads are listening to the broadcast and I am sure that a very old friend of mine, Otto, is also listening to this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to tell Otto about a fiscal initiative I know he would be very proud of&mdash;that is, the charter of budget honesty. At first glance, Otto would say that this charter is long overdue. The charter of budget honesty is what it says&mdash;a genuine attempt to be honest about where the budget is at and, most importantly, where it is going.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the major initiatives in this bill is to provide for an intergenerational report card. It is somewhat ironic that, in a nation and in a parliament such as this, where we sometimes struggle to deal with the great complexities of our society on such a regular basis, a process of preparing a report card on our fiscal direction is such a simple idea. What a terrific initiative!</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="373">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under this proposal at least once every five years, the government will release a report on the long-term sustainability of current government fiscal policies. By `long-term', we mean 40 years into the future. In a sense, for my friend Otto this may be seen as a report card into history. The intergenerational report will project the effects of current fiscal management. It will report on the impact of current revenue and expenditure programs. It is the use of a fairly trendy form of modern accounting known as `intergenerational accounting methodology', where 40&hyphen;year projections of things such as demographic data, productivity, employment and all the other variables in the nation are considered in the context of current policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As my good friend Otto knows only too well, it is always a dangerous ask to predict budget variables into the long term, let alone 40 years hence. Indeed, making assumptions about long-term budgetary outcomes is a hairy business. I am perhaps one of the very few people in this House to have just a touch of sympathy for Treasuries around Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite all the moaning words of the opposition, Treasury forecasts should be kept in perspective. For example, a one per cent error margin in a Commonwealth budget of $266 billion is over $5 billion. Even in the most accurate and respectable financial forecasts there is usually a one per cent margin of error allowed for. I might add that, often from a statistical point of view, financial forecasters are relying on more certain information than figures such as inflation, GDP growth and even wages growth may provide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My generosity to the Treasury does not, however, extend to the opposition. There is little doubt that in this debate there has been quite a deal of revelation about exactly what the previous Prime Minister and the previous Minister for Finance said prior to the election about the state of the Commonwealth budget. But they made a $10 billion miscalculation, a $10 billion mistake.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth reminding the House about some of the words of the previous Prime Minister prior to the March election in 1996. On 30 January 1996 on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS>, Paul Keating said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But again, let me remind you, Fran, we have the Budget in surplus. I mean, how many governments around the world have got a Budget in surplus?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I have a further quote from this program&mdash;and it is obviously a program the previous Prime Minister was very fond of. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So I mean, this government has been, certainly in the Western world, in the OECD area, the high priests of budget accountability, and we've remained that. I mean, I don't know why you wasted the time with a question like this.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is typical Keating aplomb. On 8 February 1996, AAP reported Prime Minister Keating as saying that there is no problem about the portents of the Australian budget. Then on 13 February 1996&mdash;so we are inching closer to that budget period&mdash;AAP again, the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The budget is in surplus. At source, we don't have an underlying problem.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Then we had this beauty, this great Keatingesque charm. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>  on 14 February&mdash;the Valentine's Day massacre, you could argue&mdash;Paul Keating says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The budget, for God's sake, is in surplus for this year in the middle of the year. We have surpluses in prospect for the next three years.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It may be forgivable if it were someone who could claim to be ill-informed or misled about the state of the nation's budget, but the thing is that the Prime Minister at that time, Paul Keating, knew what the state of the budget was. This was verified by the statement from the now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) on 29 January, when he told the third Australian Pensioners and Investments Conference:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This strategy&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">meaning fiscal consolidation&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">has led to a small budget surplus in 1995-96 and growing surpluses forecast over our forward estimates period.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So what happened was that both the former Minister for Finance and the former Prime Minister were saying, `No, the budget will be in surplus.' That was a $10 billion miscalculation. I have always been curious since the day of the election to understand how the Australian Labor Party would handle it. Perhaps they would do well, given the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="374"> recent court case outcome, to ask Mr Alan Bond to give the ALP a line on how to explain away some multibillion dollar miscalculations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The mistake was significant. It would almost be forgivable to allow for a miscalculation of that proportion if the Australian Labor Party did not have form on this issue, if they did not have good form on the fact that they have always played with rubbery figures. The most obvious example of this&mdash;and I refer to the previous speech of the member for Newcastle&mdash;was when Tony Cole, the previous Secretary to the Treasury, advised the Australian public that the One Nation figure estimates were prepared not by Treasury, not by the Department of Finance, not even by the Reserve Bank but by the Prime Minister's office. They were rubbery figures&mdash;changing the figures to suit the situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased that the intergenerational report will be based on Treasury estimates, not rubbery figures. I am also pleased that the assumptions that will form the basis of the projections in the intergenerational report will be based on a broad range of criteria, including expected demographic changes in Australia. It is fair to expect that if the intergenerational report does include the analysis based on 40-year demographic projections, then it could be a very revealing document.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is welcomed by the Australian people. It will also undoubtedly be welcomed by the financial markets, who might well be calling for the government to issue 40-year bonds on the basis of these projections&mdash;although I would hasten to add that the 40-year bond market would not be a terribly liquid market, given the difficulties in creating a deep and active market in 12-year bonds. However, there is always a chance. The openness of this government is welcomed by the public as well who will be able to see that the fiscal pain, or the fiscal pleasure for that matter, that we are enduring is not going to be a burden for our children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My friend Otto who is listening to this debate will also warmly welcome this disclosure. Disclosure is the basis for this bill. Apart 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> from entrenching the existing publications&mdash;such as the budget economic and fiscal outlook report, the mid&hyphen;year economic and fiscal outlook report and the final budget outcome report&mdash;this bill provides for a fiscal strategy statement, which is a more comprehensive statement of the government's short-term and medium&hyphen;term fiscal plans and, most importantly, the pre-election report, which obviously sends a shiver through the veins of the opposition, because it will be giving the voting electorate a budget&hyphen;like report on the state of the nation's books before the election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst the fiscal strategy statement may well be the document that most excites the financial markets and economic and business purists, it will be the pre-election report which will have the most significant impact on the nation. It will force the political parties to think carefully through and cost conservatively their promises. This document is only about accountability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to be that coalition governments, whether they be at the federal level or at the state level, are the only ones that seem to be introducing processes of accountability. For example, at the state level, particularly in New South Wales, it was the Greiner government that introduced monthly financial statements. It was the Greiner government that introduced quarterly statements in the government <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS>, which gave a detailed analysis of the overall budget. It was the Greiner government that introduced comprehensive budget papers based on both government financial statistics and budget and non-budget basis. And it was the Greiner government that provided consolidated financial statements which were introduced in New South Wales in 1989 which cover the entire audited public sector&mdash;not unaudited accounts, not even a two&hyphen;page press release, but audited comprehensive financial data.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> These coalition initiatives in the 1980s and 1990s at the state level have been extended right around the states of Australia. Who can forget the most significant, the most disastrous, financial transaction in the history of this nation&mdash;I am sure, Mr Deputy Speaker Andrew, you will not forget it&mdash;and that was the decision of the State Bank of South 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="375"> Australia to open up a subsidiary known as Beneficial Finance. Because there was no comprehensive reporting analysis of the activities of the State Bank of South Australia and because the state of South Australia had no comprehensive reporting mechanism, including the activities of the outer budget, they were allowed to get away with what could only be described, in the saddest terms, as South Australia's financial holocaust. It was an absolute disaster, and all this accountability the coalition governments are introducing is about preventing those sorts of events from occurring in the future. Of course, at the national level, we have seen a $10 billion mistake from the previous ALP government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Releasing a two&hyphen;page statement on the budget for the six months to January 1996 compared with our over 100&hyphen;page report on the state of the budget in January 1997 is the very best example of the difference between the Australian Labor Party and the coalition in their attitudes towards accountability in the public sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is no wonder that the Australian Labor Party are nervous about budget honesty. One interesting effect of this debate has been that over the last few days a few former Australian Labor Party members have been coming up to me and saying they wished that the New South Wales branch of the Australian Labor Party would introduce its own charter of budget honesty&mdash;because who can forget the Sussex Street debacle. But I will not labour that point for the moment. As my good friend Otto knows, there are some things that just never change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps the Australian Labor Party should seek some of Otto's wise advice, for Otto was a learned man. I will quote from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Times</EMPHASIS> of London about Sir Otto, as he became:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He was for many years one of the most influential figures in the world of high finance, serving first at the Treasury and thereafter at the Bank of England. After working for 20 years at the Treasury and reaching the elevated position of Comptroller of Finance before his fortieth birthday, he joined the Bank of England during the governorship of Montague Norman and played a major part in national and international financial affairs as an 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> executive and director of the bank for another quarter of a century.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He was a very talented man, particularly when it came to his advice to the Australian government. I will quote again from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Times</EMPHASIS> :</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The activity which brought Sir Otto most prominently into the public limelight, however, and did in fact give him great responsibilities was when he undertook, at the request of overseas governments, to examine the financial situation of the countries concerned and to advise on financial and economic policy.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">At the time, as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Times</EMPHASIS>  records, Australia was in extremely difficult financial and economic straits. This was in 1930. Sir Otto was asked to examine Australia's whole economic position and to report to the state and federal governments. His report was one of the most outspoken documents of its kind ever published. He described Australia as being out of budget equilibrium and out of exchange equilibrium and pointed out that Australian credit was lower than any of the other dominions. So perhaps the Australian Labor Party again&mdash;and I am giving gratuitous advice&mdash;should go and speak to him. Of course you will need something more than the traditional ways to speak with him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The verdict of most Australians, again from the time, was faithfully reflected in the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Argus</EMPHASIS>, which wrote at the time that Sir Otto fulfilled his mission with conspicuous tact, placing unpleasant facts on record in a manner that left no sting, and that he left the abiding impression of a kindly, courteous gentleman who has rendered conspicuous service to the Commonwealth. He was a man of outstanding intellect. Probably no finer brain, as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Times</EMPHASIS> says, has been applied to the practical, detailed complexities of 20th century national and international finance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is somewhat ironic that, whilst the Australian Labor Party continues to oppose our level of accountability through the charter of budget honesty, their own state government in New South Wales continues to release on a monthly basis something that is known as the Niemeyer report, which is a regular update for the people of New South Wales on the status of the New South Wales budget.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="376">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sir Otto passed away in 1971&mdash;and I am sure that he is not using the Parliamentary and News Network to listen to this broadcast&mdash;but something that is clear about Sir Otto is that he is listening and he is watching this debate and he is having a little laugh to himself and saying that his friends in the Australian Labor Party should heed his advice and recognise that openness and accountability in the disclosure of public sector finances is something that you should not be afraid of doing.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been privileged to witness an amazing speech in the parliament. I thought I was inured to shocks, given my service in this place, but this is the second surprise I have received. The first was to learn that one of the newer government members, newly elected in 1996, had stated in his local paper that he was convinced that rich children were more intelligent than poor children. Of course, that viewpoint appalled me, as it did a number of other people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I listened to the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey) referring to Otto. I have to confess to the House, almost by way of personal explanation, that I so doubted that he could have been referring to Sir Otto Niemeyer that I went and checked and said, `Surely he's not speaking about that gentleman?' Of course, in the rest of his speech he did. I suppose what shocks me is that a government member could get up and praise a gentleman who caused so much pain and suffering to Australians during the Depression. Clearly, I was not around then, but I certainly had relatives who were and who remembered the hardship, the bitterness and the stress of those days. I think the charter of budget honesty does have some things to commend it, but I do not think any legacy of Sir Otto Niemeyer should be prayed in aid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As members of parliament, when we engage in slanging matches across this chamber we tend to turn off the ordinary men and women of Australia. They expect better behaviour from us. So I should say from the outset that, sure, a charter of budget honesty sounds like a good thing and something one ought to be intrinsically in favour of. It is interesting that it was given its greatest weight during the last 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> election, notwithstanding that Labor actually had a record of improving the information associated with the budget&mdash;for example, publishing three-year forecasts of outlays and having a six-monthly review of the budget and publishing that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But during the election there was a disagreement between the then Prime Minister and the then Leader of the Opposition. Basically the then Prime Minister said, `We've been no slouches in providing information. Indeed, Mr Howard, we're providing a helluva lot more information than you did as Treasurer. We've got a six-monthly review published and we'll publish the data that you require in due course.' The then Leader of the Opposition said, `No. It's an election period and I'm entitled to have an update of information by the responsible bureaucrats.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have to say that the now government really cannot complain about the people's verdict on this and on other debates that occurred during the election. Clearly they were the winners. In fact there were some on our side saying that we were not benefiting by the stance we were taking. Therefore, I support the proposition that at election time there should be a report prepared by officials who would be seen to be neutral and not politically involved&mdash;that is, the head of Finance or the head of Treasury&mdash;certifying as to what the state of the economy was.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the member for North Sydney pointed out, one of the problems in doing that is that, with the best data in the world, you still have to make judgments about growth and trends and make estimates&mdash;after all, that is what a budget is. A budget is not a snapshot that looks to the past so that you are accurately, with no mistake whatsoever, reporting past events. A budget is really a prediction about the future&mdash;the ensuing 12 months. It is inherently difficult.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the member for North Sydney wants to say, `Look at the Labor Party; don't they actually have a terrible record in financial matters,' then I have to say that I think the only Treasurer since Federation who has been absolutely renowned for rubbery figures was the late Phil Lynch, whose budgets were laughed at. They were so manipulated that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="377"> they were laughed at. I am not particularly trying to score points on that matter. All I am saying is that budgets are about estimates and predictions of the future over a 12-month horizon and that inherently&mdash;notwithstanding great expertise and great expenditure on computers and number crunching&mdash;it is quite easy to get them wrong, even when they are not deliberate wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what does this mean for ordinary Australians? Are we now going to have a superior form of election campaigning where people will actually have greater faith in us&mdash;that is, when a government makes an election commitment, the people will have greater belief that that commitment will be carried out? The member for North Sydney is very proud of his government and proud of their record of openness and honesty. But let us go through some of the election promises they made&mdash;and I see the shadow minister for the aged, family and community services, the honourable member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), is at the table. For example, this government made a promise that they would not abolish the dental health program&mdash;a program that assisted 600,000 people in the 1996 calendar year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Is this charter of budget honesty going to prevent a promise like that to vulnerable Australians being broken in the future? If I went back to my electorate and said, `We ought to be excited; I know the government is introducing a charter of budget honesty and we're all going to be much more honest,' they would say, `Are they going to break promises?' If I went to the Rooty Hill senior citizens, they would ask, `Are they going to bloody break promises and are you going to do the same if you're given half a chance? Does this charter prevent it?' Regrettably the answer is no. You are still going to be able to go into an election and cruelly deceive the Australian people the way they were deceived in 1996. They said, `Were not going to do anything for the dental health program.' They did not even tell them that they were going to introduce a fee on nursing homes. That was not even told.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As members of parliament&mdash;not as ministers or parliamentary secretaries or members of the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> shadow executive&mdash;can we be sufficiently confident and complacent to say, `Look, those things don't matter. We are passing this Charter of Budget Honesty Bill and just because we continue to break promises it does not matter'? I think that is wrong. I actually welcome openness and honesty in this place. Perhaps we ought to try to use a different word because I think it is a bit tarnished these days&mdash;if you like, `more accountable and responsible government'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For a political party that is in government, it is easy to go into an election and make firm commitments because it has the machinery of government to cost its promises. It is much more difficult for the opposition. By the way, this charter of budget honesty does not really help the opposition with that task. It is always very frustrating for governments because they tend to make certain speeches&mdash;such as the headland speech in the last parliament&mdash;and not specific promises and they leave as late as possible the specific promises. Under this charter, these opposition promises can be costed only if the request is put through the Prime Minister and the Prime Minister agrees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People are going to say, `That is not the sort of hands&hyphen;off, impartial separation that we would like to see.' When you are costing promises, some of the underlying assumptions are always difficult. What oppositions did&mdash;and the government was no exception when it was in opposition&mdash;was have firms of accountants cost their promises. I think that was a welcome advance. So even this charter of budget honesty does not guarantee too much. It makes it difficult for the opposition to have its promises costed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Worst of all for the men, women and young people of Australia, it does not guarantee anything about a promise being broken. If we are talking about honesty, when the government of the day makes a promise and does not keep it&mdash;such as not abolishing a dental health care program benefiting 600,000 people in one year&mdash;surely we ought to have a system whereby the citizenry can take such an arrogant government to court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that the government members have been queued up to give a rah, rah to this bill, but we do have a responsibility to go back to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="378"> our electorates and talk to people. What ordinary people worry most about is governments and oppositions doing what they say and there being some relief for them, other than the next election, should they not do it. So that is what I would be suggesting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope no future government speaker attacks me because I have failed to go through the whole list of broken promises during the election. I know that when we were in government we did not keep all our promises. I cannot say that we had a perfect record, but it is a bit overbearing to hear some of the contributions by government speakers thinking that they are all light and purity when I think the 1996 budget was probably one of the worst budgets that I have ever experienced&mdash;and we had a pretty bad one in 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Joint Committee of Public Accounts does a lot of good work for this parliament. In the last year it brought down an important report into the role of the Auditor-General. If parliaments really are to become effective, there are a number of ways and means that we need to look at to guarantee that we can claw back some of the power that has, by default, gone almost completely to the executive. One of them is the committee system and the other is independent officers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I sincerely hope that, as part of its so-called commitment to honesty, they will look at the report of the joint committee into the role of the Auditor-General, who, they say, should be clearly spelt out as an officer of the parliament. I have taken a real interest in the role of the Ombudsman because I think that her role is equally important to the parliament. In fact, I introduced a private member's bill on this issue. I regret to say that the government was not sufficiently interested to pick it up, but my bill tried to strengthen her independence and cement her role as an independent officer of the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot understand why the government objects to referring this bill to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. It is true that sometimes in committees we can get very partisan and very ideological, but that is the exception rather than the rule. I found when I was pleased to served on that committee that most, if not all, members took a genuine 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> interest in the problem and wanted to come up with workable solutions. Clearly, this is the committee that should look at such legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the committee that has an opportunity to take expert witnesses&mdash;if the Liberal Party wants to do it, that is fine&mdash;from people in Treasury and in Finance, from academia and from interested citizens about this charter of budget honesty. Is this what Australia needs at this particular time? I am happy to concede that we certainly need something. I am even happy to say, as I did when I started this speech, that intrinsically I am in favour of a charter of public honesty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Attorney-General (Mr Williams) is on record as saying that he is principally concerned not so much with people's rights but with their responsibilities and duties. Do you know what, Mr Deputy Speaker? When you look through the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill, it can be seen that no responsibilities, no duties are required in it&mdash;no duties, no responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that in the age in which we live, people are no longer interested in tokenism. Once upon a time I think you could have got away with a bit of flowery rhetoric, saying, `We're fixing everything up,' `We're going to be super&hyphen;honest,' `This is a great innovation,' and `We will not have to do anything more about it.' But I think those days have gone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe there is a very well&hyphen;informed public out there who will be really surprised by the fact that this legislation will not stop people from breaking election promises and that, if they do break them, ordinary citizens will have no recourse. We can have a charter of budget honesty with dishonest election promises unfulfilled, and there will be no recourse&mdash;and this is somehow improving the parliamentary system in Australia! This is something with which we should be rushing around ASEAN countries saying, `Look, aren't we really good? This is what democracy is all about, this is what truth and honesty are all about'!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also incorporates the creation of a five&hyphen;year intergenerational report, which has been commented upon by a number of speakers. That report will look at the government's 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="379"> current policies and assess those policies in the light of future demographic changes. For example, the number of aged people in our community, rather than lessening, will increase dramatically and then very steeply. I think it is very appropriate that there be, if you like, this kind of audit or report. I suppose it will test whether or not a government, in the way it is operating with its policies, is taking into sufficient account, for example, the projected increase in the aged. I think that is a pretty good innovation, and I am sure it will be supported by all opposition members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wanted to refer also to the fact that, of course, with a lot of fanfare, the government had a National Commission of Audit. This was set up to review all aspects of, and make recommendations to, the government. But I have noticed that the government is walking away a little bit from the conclusions and recommendations of the Commission of Audit&mdash;and this charter of budget honesty is no exception. Unfortunately, I cannot find the reference to elaborate on that. Perhaps, given that time has run out, I will leave it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As members of parliament in this place, we have a joint responsibility&mdash;government and opposition&mdash;to improve the regard in which the people of Australia hold us. Therefore, I believe it is very important for us not to be hypocritical in anything we say; that when we say we are doing things that will improve standards&mdash;in this case, election promise standards&mdash;we really do them; and that, if we fail or if those standards are broken, there ought to be relief so that ordinary citizens should have the right to make a government accountable in the courts for promises and commitments it made during an election period. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to enter this debate on the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill 1996, and I note that the opposition will not be opposing this bill. I am especially keen to make a contribution to this debate because of my previous role in the New South Wales parliament as Parliamentary Secretary, and subsequently Assistant Minister, to the then Premier and Treasurer of New South Wales, the Hon. Nick Greiner.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the coalition came to government in 1988 following 12 years of the Wran&hyphen;Unsworth government, we found it almost impossible to decipher what the real financial situation was in New South Wales. During the campaign we heard a great deal from the Unsworth government at the time about the rosy forecasts for mid&hyphen; and long-term projections. We heard of the so-called great economic record of the Wran years&mdash;alleged strong growth, low inflation, low levels of government borrowings, and so it went on. But, in fact, when we came to government we found that was far from the truth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The similarities between the Wran&hyphen;Unsworth government and the Hawke-Keating government do not escape me, and the similarity is striking as it applies to the lack of transparency in presenting the budget and covering up the real economic position as it applies. When the coalition came to government in 1988, we had to establish an inquiry to find out exactly what the situation was. In fact, we found that the problems were roughly double what we had anticipated. As far as the economy was concerned, we had anticipated a state debt of something like $22 billion; we found it was nearer to $45 billion, and that was of grave concern to all of us. I would cite the fact that the Wran&hyphen;Unsworth government moved borrowings across from the borrowings column into the incoming column as a glaring example of how one can manipulate these kinds of figures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a type of budget honesty that comes into play, and I think having legislation to cover it is the most effective and best way to go about it. However, if rectifying the situation in New South Wales is as important as it was perceived and has proven to be, then how much more important is it at a national level with a budget that is 10 times the size of the New South Wales budget?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In accordance with the pre&hyphen;election commitments made by the coalition, the bill will establish three specific requirements underpinned by legislation to guarantee, as much as possible, the greatest possible fiscal discipline and detailed background information that is accurate and patently clear. These three specific requirements are: firstly, it will 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="380"> require the government of the day to publish a budget update signed off by the secretaries to the Treasury and the Department of Finance at the commencement of each federal election campaign; secondly, it will require any future government to set out fiscal strategy and report against it; thirdly, it will require the government to commit itself to responsible and accountable fiscal policy. The bottom line is that not only will parliamentarians be better informed but, more importantly, the people of Australia will be better informed and able to judge the performance of governments on that information. Who can argue against that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Without an overseeing clarity in government fiscal management, the temptation for governments to borrow beyond their means to repay to get out of trouble is very tempting indeed. But, ultimately, moneys borrowed have to be repaid or they keep going down a black hole, resulting in a legacy for future generations of Australians to address.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the growth in the Commonwealth general government net debt. We have seen that grow from around 2&half; per cent of GDP in 1972, 25 years ago, to more than 19 per cent today. It is indicative that the greater the mismanagement of the economy federally, especially during the past five&hyphen;year period prior to the 2 March 1996 election, the greater the borrowings by the Hawke&hyphen;Keating government in a vain attempt to get out of short&hyphen;term trouble.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, during that five&hyphen;year period, there has been a scandalous 500 per cent increase in Commonwealth general government debt that now stands at more than $90 billion. In fact, Australia's AAA credit rating was lost during that five&hyphen;year period and Australia has been downgraded on one occasion in addition to that since that five&hyphen;year period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clear and transparent accountability in government will serve as a disincentive to future governments of Australia to blur the exact situation without fear of discovery by the electorate with the appropriate consequences in the ballot box. Additionally, all future governments will be on notice that they go to an election with deliberately misleading information on fiscal and economic projec 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tions only at grave risk because the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill will expose such covert acts before irretrievable damage is done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn now to what I believe is one of the most important aspects of this bill as it refers to fiscal reporting. More often than not&mdash;it is almost traditional&mdash;an incoming government invariably accuses the former government of hoodwinking the people and going into an election deliberately withholding specific details as to the true state of the economy. More often than not these claims are justified, as the rot usually sets in well before a government is ousted. Therefore, the people of Australia, who should never be underestimated for their astuteness and intelligence, ultimately have to pay a heavy price resulting from the corrective measures that an incoming government has to undertake.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) spoke about budget honesty and governments not being all light and purity and having to break some election promises. I found it strange that he would say that because no government wants to take a tough line on the economy. No government wants to hurt the electorate or any sectors of the electorate, but when one makes certain promises in the lead&hyphen;up to an election, not having access to the information that is required to make the promises, and when one comes into government and finds that the information given by the government of the day was based on rubbery figures, then I suspect that people accept the fact that these promises were made in good faith when they find that the situation was not as it was portrayed at the time to the then opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased that the opposition has decided to support this bill. It will be a new period in Australian politics. It will be a new period in the lead&hyphen;up to elections because, in the past, promises were made and incoming governments invariably had to say, `Well, it was made on the premise, based on the information we were given and, therefore, unfortunately, we have to take a different line on this issue.' In fact, people were hurt and are being hurt. The risk of that occurring in the future after the measures in the bill take effect will be greatly minimised.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="381">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also note that the bill will make it mandatory for the Secretary to the Treasury and the Secretary to the Department of Finance to detail, in a pre&hyphen;election report, the most current financial and economic situation as it applies, and future projections as well, so that the people in the opposition will be fully aware and informed, so that an economic scorecard can be arrived at by the people and so that the opposition can make realistic promises based on the best possible facts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to that, the bill will ensure greatly increased access to costings from Treasury and Finance officers during the course of the election period not only by the opposition but also by the caretaker government. I am very pleased to support this bill.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on this callous government's savage attack on youth&mdash;the heartless decision by this government in abolishing the youth training allowance for certain people under the age of 18. The previous Labor government recognised that some young people under 18 who did not intend to continue their education needed some financial assistance to look for work or training. We gave them an allowance to assist them to this end.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under Labor everyone, regardless of the parental income, was eligible for the youth training allowance at a minimum of $65.67 per fortnight. This payment was to assist 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> young people in looking for employment. It also gave them a form of independence in that, small as it was, it enabled them to spend it how they wanted, and they were not constantly having to go to their parents for money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what has this new government done? From 1 January this year it has applied a parental income test, which has resulted in many young people who were previously in receipt of this allowance being cut off from this benefit. So much for this government's commitment to families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I understand it, if a family's combined income exceeds $22,700 per annum, a dependent person between the ages of 16 and 18 no longer qualifies for job training allowance. They must now be fully supported by their families. A family with a combined income of $22,700 per annum now would find it extremely difficult to financially assist their young ones to compensate for the loss of this allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government, with its commitment to the family, introduced the family tax initiative, which provides a rebate for dependent children. But what do we find? You cannot claim this rebate for a dependant unless they are at school. So here we have it: if you are between the ages of 16 and 18 and you are not at school, you will have no allowance to try to find a job and no tax rebate because you are not at school.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Numerous people have contacted me in utter disbelief that any government could be so heartless in targeting the young in the community. An example is a young 16-year-old who was doing some training on a building site and was receiving the youth training allowance. His father was earning $30,000 per annum and his mother had just been retrenched. He put in a full day's work. Although the money was only a pittance, he was pleased to be working, in the hope that it would give him some training that might lead to a job. Now he is ineligible for this and has been told he can continue training in this job but will get no money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Coming as I do from the Illawarra region, with its much higher than average youth unemployment, it is this area that has been 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="382"> particularly hard hit by this government. Government members just do not understand. We hear them standing up here day after day bleating about small business and talking about ethics. There are more millionaires on that side today than there have been in parliament since federation. How can they understand the plight of the young unemployed people in the Illawarra?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You had only to listen to the garbage they went on with today when the minister at the table, the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp), was responding&mdash;they were banging their desks. They do not understand how the young people think and feel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tonight, as they return to their well&hyphen;positioned homes on the Gold Coast and other places and to their comfortable lifestyles, and as they sit down to a lavish evening meal, let them consider the plight of the Illawarra family earning $24,000 or $25,000 a year, with a couple of teenagers not being able to go out tonight because their parents cannot afford it. I suspect they would not be eating the same sort of food that many opposite will be eating, which perhaps will be washed down with a nice drop of red. This decision has left these young people totally dependent on their families for all monetary support. They feel cheated. Many have asked me why they should bother looking for work or training when it is such a drain on their family's purse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was just one of the many hidden nasties contained in the last budget. Now it is being felt. The people of the Illawarra did not realise that this nasty was coming, although I had put out numerous press releases. It was not until the nasties actually hit that people realised. That is what we are finding&mdash;the nasties are coming home to roost. More and more people will be contacting members like me, and I suspect they will be contacting the millionaires opposite to tell them just how difficult it is for these young people. For a government which talks so much about family and family values, it amazes me that they constantly target the young. Why do they hate the young? Why are those on the other side

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Recently in this chamber I highlighted my concerns about high interest rates on business overdraft loans. I also highlighted the difficulties experienced when young people attempt to open savings accounts. The attitudes of the major banks are hardly conducive to increasing our savings. That is what I wish to highlight tonight in the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am concerned about the level of household savings in Australia. Over the last 20 years, these savings have declined at an alarming rate. Back in the September quarter of 1976&hyphen;77, just 20 years ago, household savings as a percentage of household disposable income were in fact 13.1 per cent, according to the Parliamentary Research Service. That has continued to decline throughout the years. By 1987 it had dropped to about five per cent, and in 1995 it had declined to an alarming 2.5 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This decrease over the past 20 years in household savings ratios is indicative of a complete change in attitude in the Australian community towards savings. There appears now to be a reliance on debt and borrowing, with very little incentive or inclination for people to actually save. The levels of savings within the Australian community have now reached dangerously low levels and must be addressed. Obviously it is not something that can be done easily or quickly, but it has to start with the young people&mdash;the young people we care about. There has to be a conscious shift in our attitude to savings and the acceptance of using credit cards and running up huge credit card bills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mentioned in an earlier speech in this place the fairly obvious shift away from customer service that has been undertaken by the major banks over the last few years. I believe that this has had major implications for attitudes towards savings. Banking institutions are seen as negative places. They are seen as places without customer service and without incentives to invest your money.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="383">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While low interest rates obviously are a magnificent achievement in the long run to help the Australian economy, they also have an effect on young people when they are receiving possibly only one per cent interest on their bank accounts. Again, major banks should be looking at marketing children's accounts with reasonable rates of interest, possibly three per cent to five per cent. This would give children a much greater incentive to continue to save.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most of our lifestyle habits are formed in our early years, and these are habits we continue throughout our lives. A positive initiative would be the reintroduction of the school banking system. Many people of my age or older would remember the school banking system when at an early age, from five to six years old, we would take our two shillings or 20c along in the little brown envelope to be deposited through the school banking system and be marked in the passbook.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously we cannot go back to the so&hyphen;called good old times, but I believe that if schools were able to introduce a system of banking each week, sponsored by all or one of the major banks, this would encourage and create a savings regime&mdash;a savings habit&mdash;in our young children. They would see the rewards of their savings over a long period of time and would learn about the implications of earning interest. Certainly this would create an attitude towards savings that would be continued throughout their lifetime. We have to get away from this attitude of `I want it. I want it now. If I haven't got the money, I'll borrow it. I'll use the bankcard. I'll use the credit card facilities. I won't worry about implications or the repercussions or the fact of the interest that I'll have to pay.' I guess it is very much like the attitude of the previous Labor government not to be concerned about debt. When you have a government that is running on debt, running on deficit, obviously these attitudes are carried through to the community. They are picked up in the general community and, of course, they then flow through to our young children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition government is taking control of the finances of this country. It is endeav 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ouring to do something about the damage, the huge debt and the deficit that the Labor Party has left as a legacy for our children by being financially responsible and getting out of debt and deficit. If we can encourage families and children to take a lead from the government by starting to plan a savings goal for the things they want in the future, Australia would be a far greater and stronger nation.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="383"><TITLE>Unemployment</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to bring to the House some of the views of a constituent of mine on the very vexed question of unemployment. Vicki Hyde has expressed her concern about the current trend of blaming the unemployed for the shortage of jobs in our community. A number of things are of specific concern to her. First of all, the introduction of the dole diary. The dole diary requires that unemployed people apply for eight jobs a fortnight. There are a number of practical problems associated with this, including the fact that there are often not eight suitable jobs available a fortnight for which a person can realistically apply, particularly in South Australia. Jobs today, even casual factory jobs, now require written applications and rigorous interview procedures. For example, my constituent personally knows of people who applied for a casual factory job and were required to attend two interviews and psychological testing. Another person was required to attend three interviews for a job as a casual bar person.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This process is very time consuming and psychologically and emotionally draining. It often takes three or four weeks from the time of application to the final outcome, which is often rejection. To gain a job in the current competitive climate, applicants need to prepare well and come across at their best for each interview. Vicki Hyde debates that it is realistic to expect someone to go through the same process for eight or ten jobs at the same time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been an enormous increase in casual and part&hyphen;time positions over the past two or three years, and most jobs currently advertised in the CES and through the press are of this nature. If a person has regular 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="384"> casual work, is it realistic to expect that person to apply for eight other jobs every fortnight? For one thing, the time taken attending interviews would jeopardise the work they already have, not to mention the psychological and emotional insecurity and strain in the process. To jeopardise their current casual employment in this way would be foolish, given that jobs are often gained by commencing on a very casual basis and desperately trying to increase hours to create a viable position&mdash;if this is possible in the face of government funding cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Mail</EMPHASIS> on 12 January there was an article, entitled `Jobless rebels face huge fine increases', with the emphasis on imposing fines on unemployed people who fail the activities test. These fines are greater than the fines imposed for drink driving in New South Wales. The current philosophy seems to be that anyone who is unemployed lacks a work ethic and needs to be forced, through a variety of penalties, to look for work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The thing that concerns my constituent most about that article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Mail</EMPHASIS>&mdash;and others like it which make scapegoats of both individuals and the unemployed in general&mdash;is that, in the current draconian system of dealing with unemployment, there has never been any public acknowledgment by the federal government of the difficulties of finding employment in the current economic climate or the psychological and emotional suffering experienced by the unemployed. This current philosophy on unemployment and the idea of the dole diary could only come from someone who has never experienced&mdash;the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) made this point&mdash;either first hand or second hand the pain, the frustration and the anger of unemployment. Indeed, the workers at the coalface in the DSS, who are in the unfortunate position of dealing daily with the issue, had work bans on the diary for a considerable period of time because they were able to see the difficulties associated with such a measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that this government wants to deal with the issue of unemployment purely in the realms of economics to create the ethos that the unemployed are financially 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> trying to rip off the system. Yet there is much more to unemployment than economics. The financial suffering felt by the unemployed is only a fraction of the problem. Lack of self&hyphen;confidence and self&hyphen;esteem and feelings of worthlessness are a major part of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If unemployed people care only about getting the maximum financial benefit from the system, why are so many prepared and, indeed, grateful to enter labour market programs where they work full&hyphen;time for six months for a net wage of $250 a week? Doesn't this prove that their need to build skills, self&hyphen;confidence and self&hyphen;esteem is a much greater consideration than financial gain? But now the federal government has even taken away these labour market programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had major problems with structural unemployment for many years with no sign of the situation improving in the future. Perhaps it is time the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) and the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) listened to the workers on the ground, the young people on the ground, invited their views from direct experience and visited the unemployed at the few remaining skillshares so that they see first hand the effects of their policies. Perhaps then the federal government can start dealing with the effects of unemployment in a more compassionate and realistic way. Making scapegoats of and persecuting the victims will solve neither the economic nor the social effects of unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Vicki Hyde thanks the House for the opportunity to express her views. I hope that coalition MPs will take some note. It is a thoughtful and sensitive letter and it has got insight. It is a letter which I think perhaps all coalition MPs ought to read.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="384"><TITLE>Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras</TITLE>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras is on again on Sunday, 1 March. The program&mdash;115 pages&mdash;is of the usual high quality production and gutter quality content. Most Australians, I hope, would be disgusted by this particular document if they had the chance to read it. It is predictable that the event has, once again, received glowing endorsements from a number of political leaders. It is disappointing that the Governor-General has seen fit to describe it as `an important contribution to the cultural diversity of the city and the nation'. It is gratifying, to me at least, and I am sure to many Australians, that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has chosen not to provide an endorsement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of prominent Australian companies have been named as sponsors. These companies include Telstra, Qantas, Smirnoff, Tooheys and Grace Bros. Many other companies have taken out advertisements. The event will be televised, though not directly, I understand, by Channel 10. At least the taxpayers at large will not be paying for the television coverage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps I should say that these companies, like the politicians involved in it, have most likely been intimidated into supporting the mardi gras. The fact that I would not personally choose to sign a message of support, however, does not mean that I believe that homosexuals should be vilified or discriminated against in most circumstances. Homosexuality, as I have read and understood it, is a result of a whole range of complex factors&mdash;psychological, biological and environmental. Some manage to find freedom from it; others are caught up in a spider's web from which they cannot escape.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is obvious from reading the program that some politicians, particularly the Democrats, seem to believe that the mardi gras actually contributes to a greater understanding and acceptance of the homosexual lifestyle. I would have thought that it does exactly the opposite. Many homosexuals want to be left alone and do not publicly flaunt their lifestyle. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> However, for many it is a sad and lonely lifestyle, anything but gay. They cannot, however, expect our affirmation of their lifestyle or expect that we should stand by and allow it to be promoted in the way it is promoted by the Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note that this year the Democrats are actually participating&mdash;or marching, as they put it&mdash;in the mardi gras. I see a press release here from Elisabeth Kirkby, MLC, saying, `Democrats throw down the gauntlet' and `Entire Upper House ticket and two senators to march in the mardi gras.' The two senators are Senators Stott-Despoja and Lyn Allison. They will be joined by former Senator Sid Spindler. It would probably be quite amusing to see Sid sitting on what is called the `glam&hyphen;mobile'. Apparently, the theme that they have adopted for their particular entry in the mardi gras is `keeping the bastards glamorous'. Senator Kernot says in the program, `Have a wonderful and glamorous mardi gras'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras does glamorise a most unhealthy lifestyle. It promotes a lifestyle where disease and drug abuse is rife. In my view, it is a blot on our international reputation. I hope that other decent Australians will be encouraged to speak out against it.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="385"><TITLE>Unemployment

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I confess, following those remarks, that it is a bit of a contrast to start talking about industry, employment and jobs. In a sense, I also want to bring to the new year of the parliament the sense of frustration of those people in Australia who elected a government with so much expectation. They actually believed a lot of the rhetoric and campaign material from the present government that it is actually serious about jobs, employment and training. There is a great deal of frustration when, nine months out, nothing is happening. The frustration that they feel, I feel particularly on the issue of what is happening with our metal resources and reserves in Australia. </PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We currently export about 150 million tonnes of iron ore a year, at about $30 to $40 a tonne, and going up year by year. If we were to convert all of that to a form of pig iron, it would be worth about $170 a tonne, about five times as valuable, perhaps six times in some cases, or even seven times, but certainly at least five times as valuable. If we were to convert it to steel, it would be worth $500 to $600 a tonne. In either of those cases, even at the pig iron level, it would wipe out our balance of payment problem. At the steel level we would have a massive surplus on trade and in the process we would also employ many tens of thousands of Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One would have imagined that when our biggest steel maker, BHP, one of the world's biggest, indicated mid&hyphen;year that it was seriously looking at reducing its steel making in Australia, and therefore reducing our exports of steel by at least $1 billion a year, probably closer to $1&half; billion, you would have thought the government would have said, `That is important.' Anybody who elected the government with an expectation that they would address the problems of the country would have thought, `Here is the great chance to prove it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During budget week in August I raised in this House and with a parliamentary committee a suggestion that this was an appropriate topic for a parliamentary committee to consider, and it is, and it should be. The committee actually agreed with the government majority. A Liberal Party chairman wrote to the minister asking for approval for a parliamentary inquiry. The answer was no.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is hard to believe&mdash;I am sure members opposite will have to go and check the records&mdash;and imagine that a government can consider that cutting $1 billion of exports is not worth looking at. We persisted. Over time we finally got the government to agree to an inquiry by parliamentarians. It is not a parliamentary inquiry, which therefore reduces the status of parliament and the role of parliamentarians. So we have an informal group of parliamentarians. On 20 December the minister finally agreed that that group of parliamentarians could actually make recommendations. It took four months.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a committee, chaired by Senator Tierney. I do not know what we will look at. We have had no indication of what is proposed in terms of any details or methodology. I do know that there is no-one there from Western Australia. Virtually all of this iron ore that we are exporting is being exported from Western Australia, but the government chooses not to put anybody from Western Australia on the committee. As far as I can see, it does not intend going to Western Australia to even talk about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was supposed to be a national inquiry looking at metal&mdash;iron and steel&mdash;and Western Australia does not matter. These are the people who worry about the battlers, the jobs and the small states. For anyone who is wanting an accurate reflection of what they are really on about, here is a good example. This inquiry should have been done by a parliamentary committee, but at least it is being looked at. It will only be a complete inquiry if it covers the total issue, which is: selling more metal and less ore.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="386"><TITLE>Marijuana</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 9 January this year I received a letter from a constituent who I will not identify for reasons that will become obvious. I asked her if I could read it to the House. The letter states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Dr Nelson,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our handsome, intelligent, loving 22 year old son committed suicide just before Christmas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He had smoked marijuana, perhaps in Year 11, certainly in first year University. From age 20, he had fallen into deep and debilitating depression which no treatment could lift, and latterly the doctors told us he was schizophrenic. The psychiatrists who treated our son are convinced that his schizophrenia and depression were triggered by smoking marijuana.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There has never been any mental illness of any kind in either branch of the family, so much so that we did not know how to handle our son's depression when it first arose. We have always been a close-knit and loving family. Our son we regarded as highly intelligent, very good at maths, he gained 95 in the HSC. This is the story that I am hearing from so many parents who have suffered the agonising loss of a child through suicide&mdash;no family history of mental instability, children, mostly boys, who were given every advantage, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="387"> loving families, all intelligent and full of promise&mdash;stories just like ours.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We believe that something has to be done to turn the young against pot, to convince them that marijuana is a dangerous and lethal substance which is killing our most intelligent young men. We are putting out warnings and educating the young about the dangers of tobacco&mdash;how is it that we do not seem to be putting the same urgency into publicising the case against pot?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You have the power. Please launch a campaign to change public attitudes towards marijuana, so that it is not simply regarded as a harmless `soft' drug. The actual statistics of the deaths, suicides, ruined brains, failed lives must first of all be talked about in Parliament, then publicized, then hammered home in young person's magazines, and put forward in schools. It seems that the attitude of the baby boomers is `Well I smoked pot in the 70's and look, it didn't harm me.' I know that it is supposed to be only a small minority&mdash;our son was one&mdash;who suffer these terrible effects from pot, but these are the brightest boys in the community. Can Australia afford to lose even such a minority?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You could start, as a medical man, by asking questions in Parliament about the real truth on the marijuana figures, and the real harm done by the fact that many smokers of pot, if the marijuana triggers off schizophrenia, cannot work, cannot live normal lives, ever. Go for the hip-pocket&mdash;tell the Government that these young men, if they live, are a drain on the State for the rest of their unhappy lives. Delve into the statistics on the brain degradation that occurs, question suicide statistics. I think the public will probably be horrified by the true figures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is nothing so potent as an idea whose time has come. In a generation, we have changed attitudes towards tobacco. We have to try to change attitudes towards pot&mdash;simply put, marijuana kills. Please do something. We do not want our son's death to be in vain.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Whilst clearly I and, I am sure, every member of the House would have the greatest sympathy for these parents and would identify amongst our own constituency families who have suffered similar tragedies, not all of the things which have been said by my constituent are necessarily true, but there are certainly elements of truth within it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many Australians do not appreciate, for example, that you are six times more likely to suffer from schizophrenia if you are a marijuana smoker. For some young people, smoking even half a marijuana cigarette can be a catastrophic event, and one-third of all those 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> people who are forcibly detained in psychiatric institutions in Australia are there because they have had a psychotic episode induced or precipitated by the use of cannabis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I spoke to a large private school several years ago that had a problem with marijuana. Some 30 boys had been smoking it and the drug had been introduced to the boys by one of the parents. Unfortunately, a significant number of young people believe that it is no more harmful than smoking cigarettes or drinking alcohol. It has all the problems associated with tobacco and, indeed, a lot more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things that cannabis and other drugs change is the integrity of one's intellect, the ability to think, the ability to solve problems, and your personality. Paraplegia, the loss of limb, the loss of eyesight and other catastrophes can be overcome, but the legacy of drug use and abuse is something that cannot. Frankly&mdash;and I accuse my own government of this&mdash;I think spending $37 million a year on drug and alcohol education is nothing more than a tokenistic effort when I consider some of the nonsense upon which public moneys are expended.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset, let me indicate quite obviously that the opposition does not oppose the amendment to the Sydney 2000 Games (Indicia and Images) Protection Bill 1996. Quite the opposite: obviously, it is important that manufacturers and retailers of approved material which bears any of the symbols of the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games be offered protection. The simple fact is that this amendment&mdash;which comes, I might say, pretty quickly after the passage of the original bill itself&mdash;does go to the need to add a couple more protections.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real issue at heart here is that the amendments enable Olympic Games organisers and licensed users to take action against retailers, distributors and parties in the supply chain, rather than having to pursue through the supply chain the unauthorised person who applied the indicia or images to goods and services. That really is what it is all about: you can simply take the action against whoever is illegally putting out material.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that in any Olympic Games&mdash;and certainly it will be the case in Sydney, as was demonstrated from Atlanta&mdash;the opportunity for people to recoup considerable sums of investment will come by the retailing of products. Therefore, the importance of having some security on the images and on those products themselves&mdash;knowing that the return will go to the specific people who manufacture them under licence&mdash;so that there is a return that goes back to the organising committees, is quite appropriate. As I have indicated, we have no objection to the purposes contained in this amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did want to ask one question, though, and I would be pleased if the parliamentary secretary would take this matter on board. It arises out of the whole idea behind the use of the word `Olympics'. One of my colleagues, the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), has asked me just to seek clarification on whether the term `Olympic Village', which I understand applies to a nursing home in West Heidelberg, is in fact going to be affected by this bill, and whether they are going to have to change the name of their organisation. It is a community group or a school: I am not quite sure what it is, but certainly the term `Olympic Village' is used. I said to my colleague that the answer was no, and that they can continue to use it, just as Olympic Airways continues to fly under that logo, and so on. I see officials nodding in the background. That will be good enough for me, so the parliamentary secretary does not need to worry about it. I thank the officers for that confirmation, and I will pass it on to the member for Jagajaga.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to say one or two more general things. As somebody who is the shadow spokesman for the Olympic Games, I take a great deal of interest in the media coverage of the lead&hyphen;up to this very special event and, quite frankly, I have to say that I get sick to death of some of the media in this country pursuing angles about the development of the year 2000 games from a negative perspective. Nothing demonstrates this more than when the announcement was made 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="390"> and the unveiling took place of the three caricatures of Australian animals to be the symbols for the year 2000 games.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next day, one of the Sydney dailies ran an analysis piece by an anthropologist or a zoologist, or something or other, that talked about the fact that the representations of those animals really were not drawn to scale and were not drawn properly, and that the personalities that were ascribed to those three particular characters were not appropriate. One was supposed to be fun loving, one was supposed to be a bit sporting and I forget what the other one was. To me, it just seemed so nonsensical that what I thought were three excellent representations of Australia to be the mascots for the Olympics in the year 2000 were subjected to this sort of analysis in one of the Sydney newspapers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People do not seem to be going out of their way to promote the positives of the games. What they seem to be doing is looking for a way in which they can put a negative on every aspect of it. For example, I know that when they were talking about trying to settle down the executive positions in SOCOG and who was going to take the next rung down of management, criticism was coming out that it was taking too long to do that. There has been some criticism that perhaps the construction of some of the infrastructure is not on target, and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are bound to be some hiccups in the development of a project of this scale and magnitude. But the benefit that ultimately will come to Australia outweighs any of those sorts of concerns. SOCOG and, I am sure, the Paralympics organising committee take to heart some of those criticisms. So, too, does the Olympics minister in New South Wales, Michael Knight, who&mdash;as I am sure my friend the parliamentary secretary opposite would know&mdash;absolutely throws his heart and soul into this particular project. He lives and breathes nothing but the Olympics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a consequence of this constant harping by certain elements of the media about the perceived negative aspects that could be put on any of these announcements, I would think some of those journalists, if they are operating under instructions, should kick up a fuss. If they think they are getting a name for themselves by doing this, they should have a good hard look at themselves and not ask zoologists, anthropologists or psychologists whether or not the Olympic emblems are appropriate and whether they have the personalities that were supposedly ascribed to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The indicia and images that go with the Olympic Games are just so important, as we saw in Atlanta. Quite frankly, the symbol for Atlanta was just a dead loss; I do not think too many people thought it was flash at all. I think the symbol for the Sydney games is very good. I know some people talk about it in negative terms and, as I said, you will find people who do that when it is announced, rather than simply say that it is something that represents Sydney and Australia. Similarly, when we talk about logos that come out, people always seem to want to look at some way in which they should be knocked. I think they must not have too much else to do with their time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Olympic Games is going to be a substantial event in Australia's history and the benefits which will flow to Australia because of it will be outstanding. I again indicate to the committee that we have absolutely no objections to the proposals contained in this amendment. I wish it speedy passage through this place and I commend the government for taking the necessary action to protect those retailers and others who have paid considerable sums of money for the rights to produce material for the Olympics that contain the appropriate logos, and so on. They deserve the protection of this legislation.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="391">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The main legislation has a sunset clause which concludes not long after the Olympics. Again, that is appropriate. It saves us from a lot of shonky people being out there and from a lot of material being dumped in Australia now, in the lead&hyphen;up to the Olympic Games and during the games. We support the amendment wholeheartedly. I notice the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith) has just came in. I have made a couple of comments about logos, and so on, and I suggest that he read <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> at some stage.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity given by this indicia and images protection amendment bill to make a few comments about the 2000 Olympics and I would endorse the remarks of the member for Cunningham and shadow minister. I think it is very important for all of us in public life to get behind the Olympics and make them great.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recall a few years ago, my former boss John Hewson saying that he strongly supported Sydney's bid for the 2000 Olympics because it would make us fix up the largest city in the country. It would impose a deadline on us before which we would have to put Sydney in tiptop shape. Now we have got the Olympics. That is fantastic, and I guess today I want to pose the question: are we doing enough to make Sydney a great national showcase as we Australians go on display before the world? What is going to happen in the year 2000 is not simply two weeks in summer, but a decade of economic opportunity. It is a once in a lifetime opportunity and I have a terrible feeling that in some important respects we might be letting it slip through our fingers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that the tempo of construction has recently been lifted at Homebush Bay and I congratulate the New South Wales authorities and the organising committee for all their hard work in this regard. I think there is little doubt that the Olympic site will be in absolutely top condition. It will be a great state. It will be a great site. We will have a great stadium. We will have a great village. But the question is, will we have a great city? I speak not as a planner, not as an engineer, not as a sports administrator, certainly not as a parliamentary secretary; I speak simply as an Australian and as a Sydneysider. I do not speak as an expert. I speak as an interested and concerned layman because it is not Sydney's Olympics, it is Australia's Olympics. It is a great national project; it is not just a big local project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure that people coming to this country from overseas will give us a big A for running the actual Olympics themselves. Will they give us a big A for running our country? I am sure that they will conclude, having been here in the run-up, in the duration, and in the aftermath of the olympics that we are good sports. But will they conclude that we are also good organisers?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The trouble is you get off the plane at Mascot and you try to get yourself to Homebush Bay and you are instantly stuck in a maze of suburban streets and, worse than that, you are stuck in what can only be described as inner city alleyways. You get off the plane at Mascot and try to go to the city&mdash;well, thanks to the former New South Wales government we will soon have a railway line, and I congratulate the former government for that. Thanks to the current New South Wales government, if environmental approvals go as they should&mdash;as I believe they should&mdash;we will have a decent eastern distributor and I congratulate the current New South Wales government for that. But if you try to get from the city to Homebush Bay by car&mdash;and let us face it not everyone will go by train and very few people will be able to go by ferry&mdash;you are not going to be able to do it easily. You will get stuck in the same maze 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="392"> of suburban byways, in the same back alleys which sadly have afflicted our city and its transport for generations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not fair to say of Sydney that it is a first world city with a third world infrastructure, but it certainly is not true to say that we really are in a tiptop standard for the end of the 20th century. We have freeways and tollways that come to dead ends in the middle of residential areas. We have arterial roads designed for the 1950s carrying the traffic of the 1990s. We have a rail system which has not been significantly expanded for 60 years. In my own area, we have had suggestions for transport improvement dating back to the 1870s&mdash;would you believe&mdash;when the first suggestion for a rail line to Warringah was made. In the 1930s, Bradfield, the engineer who designed the Sydney Harbour Bridge, wanted to put a railway through to the Warringah peninsular. That did not get anywhere. In the 1970s we were going to extend the Warringah expressway. That did not get anywhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In the late 1980s and early 1990s the former state government set up a section 22, a transport planning committee. In the end that broke up with inconclusive results.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I give my wholehearted support to the Sydney 2000 Games (Indicia and Images) Protection Amendment Bill 1996. This bill is a refinement by amendment of the principal act which was introduced prior to the Atlanta Games. This amendment bill makes the operation of the principal act much more effective because action can be taken against retailers, distributors and/or parties in the supply chain rather than there being a series of long, costly and potentially forlorn pursuits against unauthorised persons who apply the indicia or images to goods and services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment bill also allows SOCOG, SPOC and licensed users to take action against those who aid, abet, counsel and procure breaches of the legislation. The amendments are very important because they enable swift action to be taken against ambush marketeers who initiate the unlicensed use of the indicia or images, those in the retail supply chain standing to benefit commercially from such illegal use, and the professional urgers who help the ambush marketeers to get their unlicensed product to market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Images for these games are of special importance and personal interest to me because Syd, Olly and Millie, the Sydney 2000 Games mascots, were in fact designed by my nephew, Matthew Hatton. He does not stand to personally gain from this legislation because his graphic design was done on a contract basis but those who are in copyrighted receipt of the application of his genius&mdash;SOCOG, SPOC, and the licensed users of the mascot images&mdash;will gain legislated protections which will enable ambush marketing to be swiftly dealt with.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="393">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Matthew Hatton's graphic design and the work of the team who worked with him to bring those designs to reality have created simple, powerful, vivacious and strong Olympic mascots for these games, and they make a wonderful marketing tool for the Sydney 2000 games. The radiant energy of this trio allied to their appealing nature will allow SOCOG to project these images as indicative of the vital, fresh, innovative and friendly games that will usher in the new millennium. SOCOG's capacity to generate the income they expect from the use and production of these images, of the mascots and their associated use in other media, needs the protection afforded by this amendment bill and those of the principal act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Sydney 2000 Games now has a cheerful, friendly and dynamic trio of ambassadors to ignite overseas interest in the uniqueness of Australia and Sydney's Games. Syd, Olly and Millie are a potential goldmine for SOCOG and licensed users of these images. They have to be protected from pirates and privateers who, without compensation to the copyright owners, SOCOG, would seek great commercial benefit from their unauthorised use.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The danger of such illegal use is far greater with these creations than with mascots made for previous Olympics. Even if one looks in a most generous spirit at some past efforts&mdash;Atlanta's Izzy or the Munich Games' dachshund&mdash;one would not think that they were a marketeer's dream. In fact, the disaster that was the Montreal Olympics, where the people of that city will continue to pay the cost of those Olympics well into the next century, was probably added to by the fact that the mascot was a rather nondescript furry ball that possibly was a beaver.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, only a few of the previous efforts had the spark and vital essence that allowed them to be highly marketable&mdash;and LA's eagle was a notable example. I commend the team which worked with Matthew to realise the mascots for these Games. They have produced a brilliant, innovative, highly marketable and appealing product. The revenues to SOCOG, SPOC and the licensed users should and will be protected by this amendment bill and the principal act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am concerned, however, that the provisions contained in this bill and the principal act will cease to operate after 31 December 2000. I understand the logic and the unstated rationale behind the decision that there will be no further need for protection provisions once the Games have finished. However, this is short&hyphen;sighted. The marketability of Syd, Olly and Millie will not cease with the Games. I believe that they will be so well established and so definitive an expression of the spirit and nature of the Sydney 2000 Games that they will continue to be of commercial benefit to SOCOG at the start of the new millennium on 1 January 2001.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These characters will continue to spawn uses in a wide range of media in the new millennium. They will have the iconic force of the characters invented by May Gibbs and the larrikin appeal of Blinky Bill and his mates. They should continue to be protected from unlicensed profiteering after the Games are over. To not do so would be to deprive SOCOG of ongoing revenue to underwrite the Games into the next century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rights and protections granted by this bill and the principal act lay a very firm basis for SOCOG to argue its case with the International Olympic Committee for the extension of protection to other countries. That is extremely important. They are now taking steps in that direction because, if the indicia and images protected in Australia are to gain revenue from overseas so that overseas companies not affected by our legislation could use the indicia and the images to affect and produce goods that would be used in Australia and compete with what is being done here, that could have a detrimental effect on the revenues available here. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="394"> However, if the International Olympic Committee, in the light of the principal act and the amendments and the arguments put forward by SOCOG, grants rights in other countries, the income for SOCOG generated by that would be very important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I put my support behind that, and I ask for the parliament's support. I commend the minister for bringing in the principal act and for this amendment bill. It is extremely timely. It will underwrite the importance of all that has been put together and the hard work that everyone has done to ensure that these Games will not cause great grief to the people of New South Wales in terms of providing for the costs of those Games.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It ensures that the people who pay their money to become licensed users of those indicia and images will be properly protected and that the ambush marketeering that was evident at a number of Games will be cut back markedly. We can expect that they will still try to do it, but the force of the principal act and this bill mean that it will be very difficult for them to do so. I commend the bill, and hope it has a swift passage through the parliament.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The organisation of the Olympic Games is a massive undertaking, involving massive amounts of expenditure on materials, staff and organisation of all the associated paraphernalia that has come to be associated with the Games. The Sydney Games will be an absolutely magnificent spectacle. I am sure we all accept that. While we look at it now and think there is so much to do, over time, as all of the workmen complete their tasks, as all of the organisers finetune what they are doing, we know that we are moving to that great event in the year 2000.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As part of that, it is important to finetune legislation, which is important to facilitate the proper marketing of the games. It is sometimes forgotten that the games will be, in terms of organisation, a massive undertaking. At the same time the finer details are sometimes overlooked in that rush to get things finished, get things organised and get things up and running. It important that, in this case, the government has consulted with a wide range of people and has taken and drawn upon the experience of the Atlanta games, particularly with what occurred in relation to the ambush marketing there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just briefly, as has been explained by the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Hatton), ambush marketing really amounts to the unauthorised association of businesses with the marketing of the games without paying for the marketing rights. At times, one almost cringes at the amount of commercialisation that has become associated with the games. That has occurred over many games. If one looks at the Olympic Games of 1956, it is easy to say that was a magnificent spectacle too. But with the overall commercial infrastructure, the marketing, the organising, the television and so forth, all of that has become more and more pronounced over at least probably the last 15 to 20 years. Now we have a massive undertaking in terms of the cost of organising the games, of putting in the capital infrastructure and merely providing  all of those things that make for a great games. So, in this day and age, it is necessary to ensure that those who are using the symbols, and are trying to profit by them, pay for them because of the cost that other people and governments have had to bear in getting this thing up and running.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, it is estimated that it is going to cost about $2 billion to stage the games. That may even be slightly on the conservative side, and it is going to be shared by the organising committees and the NSW and Commonwealth governments. It is expected, for example, that the Commonwealth government's overall allocation will be of the order of $400 million. It 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="395"> is also expected that the revenue that needs to be raised in addition to government contributions will be in excess of $700 million in order to complete that process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is no mean feat and that really has to be recognised, particularly by businesses. Certainly, we will have no problem with those who are scrupulous. But there are always those who are lurking on the side, as we found from Atlanta, trying to get in to take their share of the market but not pay their fair share of the royalty, if I can put it that way. That was certainly demonstrated, as I said, in Atlanta where two international organisations did not have licensing agreements with the Atlanta organisers but attracted large numbers of people to their respective sports pavilions and the interactive theatre while implying that somehow or other they were part of the games. One did see this a bit during the staging of the Commonwealth Games. There were people on the sides who were not paying their fair due, their fair share or any sort of royalty to the organisers&mdash;who were putting in the money, the time and the infrastructure costs&mdash;yet these people were benefiting and sometimes reaping significant financial rewards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not going to be a financial bonanza for the organisers and for the governments. There are going to be significant costs for which the funds have to be found. Taxpayers are going to be asked to contribute but I think the majority of Australians want to contribute and want to see a successful games. As we see already in Sydney, even though the games are more than three years away, there is a certain excitement about the prospect of the games. There is a certain buoyancy in the New South Wales economy, particularly in the Sydney area, in real estate and all of those things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As part of that process, the bill is designed to ensure that those who are perhaps going to trade on the edges are not going to be escaping through the safety net and avoiding their respective responsibilities to contribute their share. When one looks at all of that and, at the same time, embraces the reality of the commercialism of the games, it is quite clear that it is necessary to have this legislation and eventually reach the conclusion that we need to have a successful games, a games that will be doing Australia proud.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I come from Brisbane, the city that staged the Commonwealth Games, and I am proud to say that there are in my electorate a number of present and potential Olympians who will also be part of this process and who will also be relying on the revenue collected to be able to come to the games. They will need the support of the organising committees, and this particular proposal is garnering that support in terms of the dollars and cents that will be needed. It is obviously clear, too&mdash;and I have no difficulty with this&mdash;that a certain rivalry has occurred over the years between Brisbane and Sydney; but the beauty of the games is that we are shedding that rivalry and are now having a certain unity right across the nation, and this bill is a recognition that we need to get together to achieve those ends.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am particularly proud to say that I hope that people such as Sharon Cripps, who was an Olympian in my electorate, will also be running in the Sydney 2000 Games, as will the Paralympians, a number of whom are in my electorate, who will also need that support. Remember too, that this is not just a games for people of whole body. Paralympians will also be running and swimming and all of the rest of it, and will be involved in this thing; and so we have got to be behind all of those athletes. As part of that process, we must recognise that this legislation is ensuring that there will be a successful games, that people will be required to contribute fairly, and that no profit takers and no racketeers on the side will be taking away the gloss that I am sure the games will give to the country.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="396">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend this bill and I commend the thoughts behind the amendment to the particular act. I believe that this&mdash;amongst many other projects along the way, legislatively, administratively and, of course, on the ground&mdash;will contribute to a wonderful games for Sydney and Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I comment in particular in relation to the details of the Sydney 2000 Games (Indicia and Images) Protection Amendment Bill 1996, I would like to congratulate the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith), who is in the chamber today, on his extended effort in the management of the preparation for Sydney 2000, since I know from first&hyphen;hand experience that the development of the proposals and preparations for the Sydney Olympic Games and the Paralympic Games is a mammoth logistical process. I know that all of his efforts and the efforts of his department are significant in relation to that preparation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Sydney 2000 Games (Indicia and Images) Protection Amendment Bill 1996, which relates to both the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games and the Sydney 2000 Paralympic Games, is primarily concerned with the preservation of the financial integrity of the Sydney games by facilitating licensing revenue through the protection of the use of indicia and images associated with the games. Without such protection, there is a serious threat of the loss of critically important revenue, as the value derived from being licensed to use the indicia and images may be reduced by what is known as ambush or parasitic marketing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These forms of marketing are essentially the unauthorised association of businesses with the marketing of the Olympic Games. By `unauthorised', I mean that the relevant governing bodies&mdash;in our case, the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games, known as SOCOG, and the Sydney Paralympic Organising Committee Limited, known as SPOC&mdash;have not sanctioned or licensed, directly or indirectly, the association. As a result, the effectiveness of an official sponsor's message is weakened or ambushed. This may seriously undermine the attracting of further licensed corporate sponsorship. Moreover, ambush marketing clearly threatens the overall integrity of a specific event.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ambush marketing tactics have unfortunately become commonplace in large sporting events, including the Olympic Games. Some of the well known cases of alleged ambush marketing at recent Olympics include the 1988 Seoul Olympics where one of the world's largest beverage companies carried out a marketing campaign to, `Send the families of US athletes to Seoul'. Although this tactic may have implied an association with the Seoul games, the company at issue had not paid the organising body to act as an official sponsor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A second example refers to the Nike-Reebok sneakers war at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. Reebok was the official uniform supplier to the US team. However, certain members of the gold medal Olympic basketball team, the `Dream team' as it was known, who had personal sponsorships with Nike, threatened to boycott the medal presentation ceremonies if forced to wear the official Reebok team uniform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A further example is the 1994 Lillehammer Winter Games when Wendys hamburger restaurant chain, a competitor of official sponsor McDonald's, purchased over $8 million worth of United States television air time during the telecast of the games. If you would like to get an indication of just how significant that purchase would be, during the recent Superbowl a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="397"> 30-second commercial cost around $500,000 for air time, and up to $3 million. That is for a most significant event, so it was significant air time. Wendys used this air time to run commercials depicting spoofs of winter sports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Two years earlier at the 1992 Winter Games in Albertville, Wendys had engaged in similar tactics by featuring Olympic gold medal figure skater, Kristi Yamaguci, in its television ads during the games. Wendys has learnt that ambush marketing can be terribly effective. A post&hyphen;games poll conducted by a leading market research company found that 57 per cent of all respondents incorrectly identified Wendys rather than McDonald's as the official sponsor of the games.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ambush marketing strategies were also a problem at the Atlanta games last July. Fuji Photo Film, although not an official sponsor of the games, erected billboards primarily in the Atlanta area featuring Olympic decathlete Dan O'Brien. According to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Wall Street Journal</EMPHASIS>, the United States Olympic Committee, the equivalent of our AOC, successfully persuaded Fuji to hide its logo on these billboards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A further example of ambush marketing tactics arising out of the Atlanta games, and Olympic organising committee vigilance in response to these tactics, related to the activities of the US Postal Service. Although not an official sponsor of the games, several months before the games the US Postal Service announced a marketing program involving Olympic stamps. In an effort to protect the interests of an official sponsor, United Parcel Service, the US Olympic Committee threatened to file a lawsuit against the US Postal Service. The US Postal Service, of course, ultimately backed down before any suit was filed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today's Olympic Games are big business. Corporate sponsorship is one of the most critical forms of revenue raising for the games, although it is a relatively new phenomenon for the modern Olympics. According to an article published recently in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sloan Management Review</EMPHASIS>, the first modern Olympic Games in 1896 were largely funded, around 67 per cent, by private donations with the balance coming from stamps, tickets, coins and medals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was not until 1956 that the first Olympic Games were televised. By contrast, over 80 per cent of the revenues from Lillehammer and the Atlanta games were derived from television rights and sponsorship. In fact, as recently as 20 years ago it was seriously debated within the International Olympic Committee whether that organisation had any business soliciting corporate sponsorships.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1976 summer games in Montreal marked a real turning point in this regard, serving as the first Olympic Games whose organisers sought out, albeit ineffectually, corporate sponsors. Their efforts were less than effectual because the province of Quebec was left with a deficit of over $1 billion after the games and the taxpayers of that province will not repay that debt in full until 2005.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we take a look at some figures from Montreal we can appreciate how much has changed in the past 20 years. According to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Wall Street Journal</EMPHASIS>, Montreal's organisers sold 628 sponsorships for the paltry sum of $7 million. US television rights to the games were sold for $US25 million. This is no less than astounding based on today's going rate. US television rights to the Atlanta games alone sold for more than $US450 million. That is eighteen times the Montreal amount. Illustrating a continuation of this trend, in 1995 the IOC negotiated an astounding $US4 billion contract for the US television rights alone to the Olympic Games through to the year 2008.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="398">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is therefore an established fact within the IOC that the games mean big business. At the same time, however, the IOC has made it clear that it takes a harsh view on ambush marketing. In 1993, a marketing executive of the IOC was quoted as saying that ambush marketing is not a game; it is a dearly serious business and one that has the potential to destroy sponsorship and one which, if left unchecked, undermines the fundamental revenue base of sport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, the host city contract for the Sydney games requires that the host country provide adequate protection for official sponsors. The cost of hosting the Sydney games will be somewhere between $A2 and $A3 billion. The cost of our games, however, will be shared between the organising committees and the Commonwealth and state governments. Although SOCOG plans to sign about half the number of sponsors that supported the Atlanta games, the organising committee is nevertheless expected to raise approximately $700 million through official licensing and sponsorship fees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">SOCOG has so far done an excellent job in attracting over $500 million in sponsorship agreements. According to SOCOG's chief executive officer, Dr Mal Hemmerling, that is not only 12 months ahead of SOCOG's revenue raising schedule, but also the first time that any organising committee has been so far ahead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These sponsors include some of Australia's leading companies such as Westpac, Telstra, BHP, Westfield, AMP, Energy Australia and Ansett Australia. For their generous and exclusive support of Sydney 2000, these companies deserve protection from ambush marketing activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In June 1996, this parliament legislated the principal act, which authorises SOCOG and SPOC to use and to license others to use indicia and images associated with the Sydney games. The principal act incorporated many of the recommendations set forth in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cashing in on the Sydney olympics: protecting the Sydney Olympic Games from ambush marketing</EMPHASIS>, a report presented by the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee in March 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government recognised the importance of putting in place a principal act before the start of the Atlanta games in July 1996. However, at that time the government recognised that the legislation may require some amendment. As the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism noted in the second reading speech for this bill, having the principal act in place in June 1996 permitted SOCOG and SPOC to take advantage of the significant marketing opportunities associated with the Atlanta games. The government also believed that amending the legislation at a later date ensured that there was sufficient time for consultation with the organising committees as well as those groups which will be most affected by the amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For trade and domestically produced goods, the principal act permits action only against the unlicensed entity who actually uses the Sydney games indicia and images for commercial purposes. The government believes that the act, as it stands, may therefore make it difficult to effectively control ambush marketing activities. The amendments set forth in this bill extend the potential liability to retailers, distributors and other parties in the unauthorised entity's supply chain. In addition, the amendments enable the Sydney organising committees and licensees to take action against those who aid, abet, counsel and procure breaches of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The changes in the legislation mean that retailers and distributors of goods bearing the Sydney games indicia and images will need to ensure that the persons who apply the indicia and images are licensed to do so. To facilitate compliance with these provisions, the legislation provides that a register of licensed users shall be regularly available for inspection.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="399">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The SOCOG has proposed additional measures to ensure public awareness of the legislation as it relates to the use of the Sydney games indicia and images. For example, SOCOG proposes to disseminate widely a list of licensed users. Retail and other affected industry associations have agreed to cooperate with the games organising committees in the dissemination of this information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the legislation does put additional burdens on retailers and distributors of goods bearing images of the games, the government believes that the legislation represents a balanced and workable solution that addresses the interests of all affected parties in a fair and reasonable manner, and without placing an undue burden on commerce. These changes to the legislation are proposed after significant consultation with the games organisers and other interest groups. As the minister indicated in the second reading speech for this bill, we are confident that the organising committees and the affected industries will work together in a cooperative manner which will add to the effectiveness of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth noting that neither the principal act nor the amendment bill operate to prohibit entities from exercising their existing rights under Australia's intellectual property laws. In addition, neither the principal act nor the amendment bill prohibit entities from using the Sydney games indicia or images to provide factual information or for the purposes of criticism or discussion. For example, the legislation would not prohibit athletes from using the Sydney games indicia and images for the purposes of providing a factual description of their activities in the games. To take that one step further, should Shane Warne become a decathlete in Sydney in 2000 he will be able to wear his Nike earring as part of the festivities of the games.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be 10,000&hyphen;odd athletes at the games and millions of television viewers around the world, and I believe all of us here today are aware that the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games and the Sydney 2000 Paralympic Games are events of the utmost significance, not just for the city of Sydney, but for all Australians. That includes the people of North Sydney who will participate in this event in a quite extraordinary way. The most significant event of the Olympics, the one that dates back to the time of ancient Greece, is the marathon run. On 1 October 2000, at probably a very early hour I would imagine, given the heat of Sydney at that time, the gun will go off in North Sydney for the beginning of the marathon, which will pass over the Sydney Harbour Bridge, and hopefully all the marathon runners will make it into the Homebush stadium.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the people of North Sydney will certainly have an intimate part in the marathon run. Most importantly, the marathon runners will be able to get a very good sighting not just of the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the magnificent harbour, and not just of the beautiful vistas around the harbour on the way to Homebush Bay; they will also get a fantastic view of one of God's electorates&mdash;North Sydney. That is very important. And on that occasion I think we will be able to convince the state government, notwithstanding the fact that they have severe budgetary problems, to lift the tolls so that the marathon runners will not have to pay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As my colleague John Fahey, the Minister for Finance, said in 1993 when he was Premier of New South Wales, the Sydney Olympics and the Paralympics offer the opportunity to inspire a generation. The Sydney games will give all Australians an unprecedented opportunity to show the world the diversity, skills and natural beauty of our unique nation. This legislation is further evidence of the government's commitment to make the Sydney games a success. As law&hyphen;makers we have a responsibility&mdash;indeed, an obligation&mdash;to do all that we can to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="400"> ensure that the Sydney 2000 games are carried out in a highly professional and fiscally responsible manner. This legislation is just one way in which we can fulfil that obligation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. I think Darwin and Alice Springs is a bit far out of the way! This bill introduces some amendments to the Sydney 2000 Games (Indicia and Images) Act, passed by this parliament in 1996. Specifically, the purpose of the bill is to introduce a licensing regime that restricts the use of several key words, phrases and images, specifically with the Sydney 2000 Olympics. It allows for injunctions to prevent breaches of the licensing requirements. It compensates those sponsors who may face damage from an unlicensed rival. The bill would give the Australian Customs Service the power to seize goods that they suspect contravene the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is suspected that the cost of hosting the Olympic Games in 2000 will be between $2 billion and $3 billion. The figures are obtained from the second reading speech of the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Sydney 2000 Games (Mr Warwick Smith). He said it would cost in excess of $2 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The parliamentary digest figures say that it is between $2 billion and $3 billion. Television rights have been sold for record amounts and the New South Wales and Commonwealth governments will provide limited funds to cover costs, but the commercial sponsorship is required to provide a large portion of the remaining costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Corporate sponsorship will be the second largest source of revenue from the Games and therefore it is important that the sponsors are given exclusive rights and that they get value for their money. In fact, the host country is obliged under the contract between the host city, Sydney, and the Australian Olympic Committee and SOCOG to provide adequate protection for sponsors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the bill was introduced by the honourable minister, Madam Deputy Chair, I have received a brochure from the Sydney SOCOG which lists the major international and Australian sponsors. It is a very impressive list. As mentioned by the member for North Sydney, the Sydney 2000 Games is going to be probably the most prestigious games that will be held in the Southern Hemisphere for many a long time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the highest level of sponsorship in the team millennium Olympic partners includes global sponsors Coca&hyphen;Cola, IBM, Visa, Fuji Xerox, UPS, Kodak, McDonald's, Panasonic and Time with international rights. The team millennium Olympic partners also include an impressive list of Australia's leading companies such as Westpac, Telstra, BHP, Westfield, AMP, Ansett Australia, Energy Australia and Swatch with national rights as well. No doubt, as we get closer to the year 2000, other smaller organisations will come on stream in terms of providing sponsorship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill involved much consultation with interested parties, including Games organisers and, more importantly, retailers. It was decided that a register of licensees would be readily available to business for verification of merchandise and therein not disadvantage retailers.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="401">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for North Sydney mentioned the fact that if Shane Warne were to participate in the decathlon he might be able to wear his Nike earring. At the same time I can remember watching a television program recently which said that some large organisations which are not official sponsors of particular games or other sporting activities get well&hyphen;paid athletes who are very well known and put them in their sporting apparel, which sometimes does not contravene the spirit of the franchise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That may be legal or illegal, and perhaps the minister might be able to tell me at some later date. If I remember rightly, Reebok were the major sponsors for running shoes for the last games. But one of the competitors wore gold Nike running shoes. Obviously it would have upset the Reebok company, because they had paid an enormous amount of money for an exclusive franchise for their product, to have a rival company gazump them by having one of the world's best athletes wear its shoes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Hopefully, this bill will stop ambush marketing. In March1995, the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee, at page 22 of its report, defined ambush marketing as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The unauthorised association by the business by their names, brands, products or services with a sports event or competition through any one or more of a wide range of marketing activities; `unauthorised' in the sense that the controller of the commercial rights in such events, usually the relevant governing body, has neither sanctioned or licensed the association itself or through its commercial agents.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In other words, corporations would be able to use the Sydney Olympic symbols for their own commercial gain, without paying a fee. If this were a frequent occurrence, SOCOG would lose money, and sponsors, who have paid large licence fees, often as high as $40 million, would see their previously guaranteed exclusive rights eroded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To protect official sponsors from this sort of advertising, the bill sets up a regime which limits the use of key words for commercial purposes. These include the millennium games, Sydney Games, Sydney 2000&mdash;or any combination of the words games and 2000&mdash;Olympiad, Olympic, share the spirit, summer games, team millennium, any combination of the words 24th and Olympic or games, use of the word Olympian or Olympic with gold, silver or bronze, and the use of any visual or oral representation representing a connection with the Olympic or Paralympic Games.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the legislation does allow for some exemptions. Businesses already using prescribed words, such as Olympic Airways, can continue to use them so long as they do not try to infer a formal relationship with the Olympic Games. The exemptions also include the reporting of factual information relating to the Olympics, as in the use of news stories or tour operators. Sporting bodies are also given some leeway so that they can effectively promote their teams and athletes in order to raise awareness and to fundraise. It is recommended that these bodies negotiate a memorandum of understanding with the games organisers in order to safeguard their activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Olympic Games to be held in Australia in the year 2000 will be an opportunity to showcase our nation to the world. It is therefore important that SOCOG is able to raise the funds necessary to run the Olympics well. As the bill is an important way of protecting the financial integrity of the games and involves minimal Commonwealth financial outlays, I have pleasure in commending the bill to the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I think the whole Australian community should be gearing up for the year 2000. When we in the Northern Territory hear of the number of visitors expected to visit Australia for the 2000 games, we are very keen to make sure that everything works out well in the lead 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="402"> up to the games and, of course, the games. Visitors coming to Australia need to feel that the organisers have the capacity to provide the transport facilities, the accommodation facilities, and all the other technical facilities that are required in the running of the games.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously, people in Western Australia, South Australia, the Northern Territory, and other parts of Australia are hopeful that once the games are over there will be an influx of visitors to their state or territory. That will have a benefit for tourism, which is very important. We can take note of what happened after the Commonwealth Games in 1988. It is reported that after the people had visited Brisbane there was a great influx of visitors to the southern capitals of Australia. Obviously that had the benefit of the revenue derived from it. I congratulate the ministers involved in the passing of this legislation and wish them well for the year 2000.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In briefly summing up, I thank all those that have contributed. Firstly, Mr Martin, the member for Cunningham, on behalf of the opposition has indicated that they will support this amendment to the bill which we passed in the parliament back on 28 June. We thank him for that support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Abbott, the member for Warringah, indicated some concerns about the movement of people visiting Sydney in the year 2000 for the games. He should be assured that there is extensive activity taking place in New South Wales to develop a road system and a rail system, and so on, to meet the expected arrivals. A lot of work is being done also with regard to Sydney airport but it is not appropriate to deal with all of that here at the present.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Blaxland (Mr Hatton) indicated that he had a personal interest in the graphic design development for the mascots for the games and wondered about the extension of the protection to cover the mascots usage beyond the cut&hyphen;off date in the legislation, 31 December in the year 2000. The mascots are protected under the definitional sections of the principal act in section 9, but SOCOG also could register the mascots as trademarks to protect them for a further 10 years beyond the games. I think that that is a point that he perhaps could take back. I would certainly raise that with SOCOG and Minister Knight who will be in Canberra next week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Dickson, Mr Tony Smith, did a detailed overview of the benefit of the games to the nation and I think all members appreciate that fact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Hockey, the member for North Sydney, gave a detailed and well&hyphen;researched coverage of the issue of sponsorship; this amendment to the principal bill is primarily about protecting the activities of sponsors who register under the principal act. The cost of the games has been said by many speakers to be somewhere in the vicinity of $2 billion to $3 billion. The licensing fees alone, which this bill primarily seeks to protect, are of the order of $700 million. Personally, I think it will be worth considerably more than that, but here we have the Commonwealth parliament in a bipartisan way taking a very positive step to provide the protection to underpin the flow of funds required to meet the $2 billion to $3 billion expected costs to sponsor what will be undoubtedly the pre&hyphen;eminent Olympic Games in our lifetime, occurring as they do on the turn of the century. The millennium games will, in fact, be a wonderful showcase for Australia, so it is incumbent on all of us to do everything we can to make sure that we do it well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other matters that I wanted to briefly raise were touched on by several of the speakers, and indeed Mr Dondas, the member for the Northern Territory, raised the issue of the benefit to the rest of the nation. It is not just, of course, the Sydney Games. The benefit to the rest 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="403"> of the nation is pre&hyphen;eminent in all of our minds as is ensuring successful visits prior to the games by overseas teams&mdash;I addressed that in question time yesterday. Follow&hyphen;up visits are also going to be particularly important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the activities engaged in by the New South Wales government and by this government is the development of an Olympic business round table. Detailed discussions and strategies are being developed to make sure that the private sector is able to secure longer&hyphen;term economic dividends from the games in the form of more jobs through increased overseas investment and trade and international tourism. Detailed discussions with Austrade and the Australian Tourism Commission and other Commonwealth departments, together with the Olympic business round table and the New South Wales government have been undertaken for some time and we expect, as we go a little closer to the games, that there will be a more public manifestation of those discussions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth has already contributed $150 million to the facilities for the games. We have undertaken to fund up to $25 million to stage the Paralympic Games. We have provided $25 million for the Sydney showground to be relocated. We are passing this legislation, which in its minimum form will underpin a value to the games organisers of some $700 million. We have established two ministerial committees, both of which I chair; one relates to taking an overview about passenger facilitation, Sydney airport, telecommunications, customs, meteorology and so on. We have some 35 Commonwealth departments and agencies involved in a coordinated approach working with SOCOG and New South Wales to ensure that every contingency that we can possibly think of is covered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other key committee is a committee of the National Security Committee which I chair on security matters. That committee brings together all the security agencies of the Commonwealth to work with New South Wales police, SOCOG and international agencies in ensuring that every step is taken to make sure that, during the course of the games, we have covered every potential eventuality that might occur in that particularly difficult area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other area for which I am responsible relates to the funding of the athletes so that they can excel in the 2000 games. We hope Australian athletes will be able to do as well as they did in Atlanta, which was the best ever Australian performance at an Olympic Games. We have somewhere in the vicinity of $135 million per year under the Olympic athlete program. There will be about $360 million that will be provided by the Commonwealth government for the preparation of our athletes for the year 2000; that is a very significant amount. So, all in all, the government is well progressed down the path of ensuring that the Sydney 2000 games are able to be achieved to the satisfaction of all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment follows a great deal of consultation. It builds on the principal act. It relates, as other speakers have said, to the protection of licence holders and provides a speedier method by which prosecution can take place to ensure that protection becomes a reality. It is something that is absolutely essential to the financial wellbeing of the games. I think it was the member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey) who referred to the difficulties in Montreal; that they will still be paying their games off in the year 2005. We want to avoid that prospect in this country in the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am therefore particularly pleased that all sides of the parliament have been able to join with the government in ensuring that this legislation is put into effect. I thank all speakers for their very useful and helpful contributions on an important national issue that will capture the attention of all of us, certainly in the year 2000, if not as we get closer to it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This legislation amends the Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Act and enacts the Road Transport Reform (Heavy Vehicles Registration) Act. The Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Bill is essentially technical and non&hyphen;controversial. It relates to clarifying the regulation making power under the existing legislation, which was passed by the parliament in 1995, and various other technical amendments, which I will not address in my contribution to this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Road Transport Reform (Heavy Vehicles Registration) Bill is essentially designed to create a framework for uniform national regulation of road transport by heavy vehicles which is a product of a process established by the former Labor government, through the National Road Transport Commission, to produce uniform regulatory structures regarding road transport throughout Australia. What the Road Transport Reform (Heavy Vehicles Registration) Bill does is establish a regulatory framework through which we will achieve uniform regulation of heavy vehicle transport throughout Australia. It does not go to a huge amount of detail because essentially, as is the case with most legislation of this nature, the regulatory processes will be through the making of regulations, rather than provisions in the act of parliament itself. It is supported by the opposition, as is the amendment to the Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will comment, briefly, primarily on the second of the two pieces of legislation, the Road Transport Reform (Heavy Vehicles Registration) Bill 1996. It is part of a broader picture which, as I indicated, was introduced by the Keating government in 1992 with the agreement of all states and territories and the support of the then opposition. The opposition strongly supports the continuation of the reform process that was established at that time and has been working reasonably well till now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a fairly difficult process, because the nature of road transport is by no means uniform across the country. The sorts of circumstances that prevail, for example, in rural Western Australia with respect to road transport are very different from circumstances that prevail in metropolitan Sydney and metropolitan Melbourne. So in some respects there are pressures for differences which have had to be worked through in the process of negotiation and discussion between the states and territories and the Commonwealth, through the NRTC process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My observation to date has been that this process has worked pretty well. All the stakeholders remain committed to it and, in my understanding, fairly satisfied with the progress that is being made. I took the opportunity to be briefed by the NRTC people some time ago, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="405"> and I have been impressed with the work that is being done and the progress that is being made. This piece of legislation is an important step forward in developing that process of uniform national regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The road transport industry is a very difficult industry to regulate. There is plenty of history to indicate to us that simply legislating, simply putting regulations on the books, is not necessarily going to achieve the outcome that we as parliamentarians might desire. It is not easy to ensure that rules and regulations are being adhered to when you have got a large number of heavy vehicles using the roads at all times of the day, right across the country. Policing is always going to be difficult in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many smaller operators in the industry. It has been a pattern in recent times that we have had an increasing number of owner&hyphen;drivers or small companies emerging who in some instances have been breaking regulations with relative impunity. It is a serious problem, particularly with respect to issues such as driver hours. Many long haul journeys are necessary because of Australia's size, particularly along the east coast between Brisbane and Melbourne, and across the Nullarbor, and it is very difficult to ensure that drivers are driving only the maximum hours&mdash;which until now have varied from state to state, ranging from 11 hours to 14 hours of non-stop driving. It is very difficult to ensure that you can police this properly. The consequence of drivers breaking these laws is potentially loss of life on the road, fatigue, accidents and serious road trauma.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, while you have intense competition, while you have ever mounting competitive pressures on businesses to diminish their costs, which often include substantial transport costs, then you are going to end up in a situation where the pressure on price for transport is reflected in people breaking the rules. That is precisely what is happening. It is difficult to estimate how much, but, as a very good indicator of how serious the problem is, the three major operators in this industry in the past&mdash;Mayne Nickless, Brambles and TNT&mdash;all in some form or other have exited or have been in the process of exiting from the general road transport industry over the past year or two. The reason is that their capacity to make reasonable profits out of their operations in this industry and at the same time comply with the law has more or less been obliterated by competition from smaller operators. In some instances the competitive advantage of those smaller operators is not that they are more efficient, not that they are better at what they are doing, not that they are doing it more quickly&mdash;legitimately&mdash;but that they are breaking the rules. They are forcing drivers to drive ridiculous hours&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="HOLLIS" NAMEID="DH4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DH4">Mr Hollis</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And they are not doing proper maintenance.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YU5">Mr TANNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my colleague indicates, they are not properly maintaining their vehicles, not maintaining them in a safe way; they are breaking a whole range of regulations that are there ultimately to protect people who use the roads&mdash;not only people who are driving the trucks but also other road users. That is a serious problem and I certainly do not believe that simply passing legislation is going to resolve these issues. It is something that requires a great deal more.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The National Road Transport Commission has come up with a proposal called `fatigue management', which is a slightly more sophisticated strategy for dealing with the issue of driver hours. I am fairly sceptical about the prospects for this approach because, amongst other things, it actually lengthens, technically, the number of driver hours that can be driven legally. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="406"> This is under a regime where the drivers are supposed to manage the amount of time they are actually in the saddle, so to speak, and it is supposed to ensure that they have breaks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Time will tell how effective this approach is going to be. As I said, I have some substantial reservations about it, but I am prepared to accept that the National Road Transport Commission needs to make some attempt to tackle these issues. I would actually prefer to maintain a fairly strict regime. The old logbook system clearly works more in the breach than successfully in observance. There are other options, some of which have some difficulties. Electronic monitoring is one of the possibilities that is opening up but there are some difficulties with that. Clearly, it is a controversial prospect, but we need to be putting a lot of effort into this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the government for continuing the process with the National Road Transport Commission. This piece of legislation is one of the steps and I urge the government to pay particular heed to these issues of safety, hours and maintenance, which are all part of the total picture in this industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, we are seeing a pattern of exploitation in the road transport industry. It has been there for a long time and it is gradually mounting. We have a situation where owner drivers no longer have any form of industrial regulatory protection. An attempt was made to put that in the industrial relations legislation of the former government; it was effectively neutered by the High Court, and it is has now been removed in the new workplace relations act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, it is something that is difficult to regulate, but it is a key component of the problems in this industry. Many owner drivers are very vulnerable to being exploited because ultimately they have to get their vehicles on the road and they have to get some revenue coming through no matter what the circumstances. So it is extremely important that we pay some attention to some form of industry protection for owner drivers as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The key issue, and the underlying theme pertinent to the question of registration of heavy vehicles, is that of fair competition in the industry; not only fair competition within road transport but also fair competition between road transport and other modes. There is a lot of inflammatory and inaccurate material around about the contribution that the heavy road transport industry makes to road trauma. In fact, 70 per cent of accidents involving large trucks are caused by drivers other than the driver of the truck.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an important statistic that we need to note. The sort of thing that you sometimes see on tabloid current affairs shows about drivers high on drugs and all these killer trucks on the roads is often grossly exaggerated. We need to concentrate on the facts and not so much on the tabloid presentation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a problem and, as a parliament, we need to make sure that we steadily diminish that problem. The difficulty we have at the moment is that it seems to be increasing because of the competitive pressures which mean that there are lots of people out there&mdash;lots of small companies and owner drivers&mdash;who are under ever increasing pressure to bend or break the rules.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The end result is unfair competition, which impacts adversely on those who do adhere to the rules, including the larger companies. At the same time, it potentially places lives at risk because there are drivers on the roads who have been driving for ridiculously long periods of time and who are almost by definition going to be a safety risk. There are vehicles that have not been properly maintained and a range of other problems. So I urge the government to treat this issue very seriously and to put as much support as it can behind the NRTC to ensure that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="407"> the entire road transport industry&mdash;a highly competitive, productive and efficient industry&mdash;operates on the basis of fair competition and a fair deal for its drivers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was disappointed to see that the government has chosen to intervene in the recent wages case with respect to the Transport Workers Union and the Australian Road Transport Industry Organisation. The government has put the view that this deal is about trying to enforce higher wage costs on a lot of smaller operators in the industry, thereby changing the balance in the competitive arrangements between them and the big operators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I take a different view. My view is that most truck drivers do not get paid very much to start with and, of all the workers around the place, they would be pretty high on the list of people who should be paid more. One of the reasons they are not is because of the problems of regulating the industry and the fact that, at the bottom end, there is this intense and often illegal and unfair competition which imposes enormous downward pressures on their wages. Therefore, it is important to ensure, not only that there is proper regulation in the industry to minimise that, but also that there is some sort of fair wages outcome. That is reason why the government was wrong to intervene in that case. Truck drivers should get paid a reasonable wage for what is ultimately a difficult job, a skilled job and a job that has lots of disadvantages&mdash;the long hours, the time away from families and the like. That should be done by ensuring that that job has actually got a decent rate of pay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a final comment to make in that context. This is not meant by way of any criticism, either of the current government or the former government, but merely as a suggestion to which I hope the government will give some consideration. In tackling this set of issues in the future, one of the things that we have got to start focusing on is rewarding the good firms, because there are plenty of small and medium sized road transport operators out there who do the right thing. In spite of the fact that it hurts them, and in spite of the fact that they run the risk of losing contracts to the competitor around the corner who does not do the right thing, they do it. They ensure that their drivers have proper breaks, are not driving 20 hours at a stretch or 36 hours with only a three&hyphen; or six&hyphen;hour break in the middle. They do the right thing, they ensure that their maintenance is adequate and that they do not cut corners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things that we as a parliament and as legislators need to do is to build structures which guarantee that, in some form or other, those who do the right thing actually get rewarded through the processes of regulation. I do not have any specific suggestions as yet, but it is something that I intend paying some attention to. I urge those on the government side to think about that because it may be one way of starting to diminish some of these problems. It would create some incentives for these companies and these operators to abide by the law, and not put them in a position where the only incentive is to be a good corporate citizen and where the negatives they face are those of losing contracts, losing work. We need to add something else to the equation that will ensure that we have a much higher degree of compliance with the existing regulations and any future regulations than we do at the moment. As I indicated, the opposition supports both pieces of legislation that are before this chamber at the moment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I note, however, his recognition of the very competitive forces that operate, below the bigger trucking companies, within those smaller operators who go out to seek contract rates that are almost the bare bones of making profitability. Both he and I would be aware of that very difficult set of conditions where the smaller companies subcontract and tend to break the regulations. I agree with him about that competitive nature of the industry. I note, however, the very strong and entrenched position of the TWU and its relationship with some of the bigger trucking companies about which I will debate with him at another time. So I am pleased to hear the support of the shadow minister and the initiative of the former government on this very important national issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This goes back to arguments that some of us have been close to in terms of section 92, that road transport operators could use some state jurisdictions to register their operations and achieve some savings and travel across state boundaries because of section 92. The licensing of particular interstate truck drivers, again, was a matter of concern over many years where, say, truck drivers in Victoria who travelled to New South Wales and Queensland were not subject to those state regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before the shadow minister leaves I would just like to compliment the former government on the standard national gauge because in similar terms to this bill, the standard gauge was achieved during the time of the former government, having been on the books since 1927. I place on the record my very strong support for the completion of that gauge. That is compatible with the legislation we now have before the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To look at some of the details of the bill, this is one of the vital, but probably not well known, micro&hyphen;economic reforms of recent years, moving to national uniform and consistent regulations for road transport. In Australia we are well aware of our major shortcomings. One of the features of our history since federation has been the differing rules and regulations applying from state to state. That is all too evident to people who have an interest in these matters. States have fought over rail gauges and regulation for their road industries. There are also the arguments about daylight saving between Queensland and the southern states. Hopefully, here in the federal parliament we can get consensus in this road transport area that might lead to a more sensible, rational approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The wider community may have some understanding of the issue if they consider the differences in general road rules and different rules applying to driver's licences in different states and territories. Traditionally, Victoria has had a different right of way rule for turning at intersections. The ACT has different rules for obtaining a driver's licence which allows a full licence to be obtained at the age of 17. We even have different blood alcohol limits across the states, especially for those with provisional licences, which seems a strange set of circumstances. The same inconsistencies have affected the commercial transport sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These two bills are important steps down the path of ensuring a national uniform system of regulation for road transport. They will bring about administrative savings to governments and efficiency benefits to the industry. The first step down the path to uniform national road transport regulations occurred in 1991 at the Special Premiers Conference, a part of the new federalism concept initiated by Prime Minister Hawke and a forerunner to the COAG process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was following that conference that the National Road Transport Commission was established. It was overseen by ministerial council to implement the nationally uniform or consistent road regulations across Australia. The NRTC is in the process of developing the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="409"> new national road transport law through six modules. These modules include road transport charges, vehicle and traffic driver licences as well as compliance and enforcement. All of these issues are matters which this parliament and state parliaments have grappled with for many years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The two areas that are dealt with by these two bills are the transport of dangerous goods and the issue of registration for heavy vehicles. In each case the proposed regulation and legislation undergoes a thorough process of scrutiny by industry players, enforcement agencies in each state and territory, and governments in each jurisdiction. All such proposals ultimately must be accepted by the ministerial council before they are enacted into complementary legislation at the Commonwealth, state and territory level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most recent annual report of the National Road Transport Commission reports that the 1995&hyphen;96 year saw these national transport reforms really taking effect. I am delighted to see that progress at long last is being made. Thus, we are moving from the planning, argument and debating stage to the implementation stage in several areas, and the reform process is beginning to bear fruit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have already seen in 1996 the adoption of uniform national registration charges for heavy vehicles in all Australian jurisdictions. I well recall the arguments on that in terms of livestock transport, the definition of heavy vehicles, and the intransigence of New South Wales in conforming with some of the desires of the former Labor government to try to get a national position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The two bills before the House will help us move down the path towards uniform road transport laws in areas of heavy vehicle registration and the transport of dangerous goods. The dangerous goods part of it seems innocuous enough but, in my view, that is a helpful precedent because everyone in every state can agree that dangerous goods transport is a problem. In Victoria we have the argument about Point Lillias and Coode Island in terms of transport of dangerous goods, so it is a particular issue near and around my electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation to control the transport of dangerous goods in Australia dates back to the turn of the century when most Australian states legislated to control the transport of explosives on the basis of the United Kingdom's Explosives Act 1875. Later this century, most states legislated to control the transport of flammable liquids. It was not until 1973 that the first moves were taken towards developing a nationally consistent framework for regulating the transport of dangerous goods. This goal was partially realised in 1980 with the establishment of the Australian Code for the Transport of Dangerous Goods by Road and Rail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">1994 saw the passage of the original Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Act, which sets out the broad legislative framework for establishing uniform laws across Australia. I recall some of the debate on that act and, as I say, that sets a precedent for some of these other nationally uniform regulations. This was followed by the Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Regulations and now the amendment bill is before the House, which will ensure that the regulations can be implemented in practical terms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These reforms are designed to enhance the safety of transporting dangerous goods, to improve the national consistency of these laws and to ensure improved compliance and enforceability. They will also improve the complementarity of the rules for other modes of transport, as well as international practice. The regulations set down uniform requirements for the classification and packaging of dangerous goods, placarding and marking of vehicles and containers which carry such goods in bulk, transport documentation, procedures for transport 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="410"> and transfer of dangerous goods, and emergency provisions. There will also be a uniform system for licensing drivers of vehicles carrying dangerous goods in bulk. The regulation will go some way in clarifying the roles, duties and responsibilities of those involved in the transport of dangerous goods. Most importantly, we will have a system of regulation for transport of hazardous substances which is recognised all over Australia, wiping out the expense and complication associated with numerous state and territory laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think anyone on either side of the House could complain about those sets of objectives and I am hopeful that they will be implemented in a practical form at the state level. Citizens will feel more comfortable when they see some of these very large vehicles carrying dangerous goods, knowing that if an accident occurs, action will be taken, people will understand what to do and fire prevention authorities will have sufficient information to handle such an unfortunate happening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the heavy vehicle registration, which has always been a bone of contention with the transport companies and state government, the same objective applies to the rules governing the registration of heavy vehicles. Heavy vehicle registration is yet another aspect of road transport to be affected by differing rules in different jurisdictions, be they state or federal. The National Road Transport Commission aims to ensure that the rules governing requirements for registration vehicles over 4&half; tonnes are uniform and consistent between all states and territories. The Road Transport Reform (Heavy Vehicle Registration) Bill will set out the broad legislative framework for this important initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The national scheme will mean that, for the first time in Australia's history, we will have uniform requirements for new registrations, re&hyphen;registrations, renewals, registration transfer, interstate conversion, suspension and cancellation, and conditional registration. Some of the main features of the proposed scheme include the availability of three, six and 12 months or part&hyphen;year registration. I think, again, all these are fairly straightforward and commonsense recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just note the long debate and discussion that has been going on as usual between the Commonwealth, who had a desire to make an Australia&hyphen;wide position, and some of the states, who always complained that they had special conditions. They would not budge in making what I see as a very sensible piece of legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new concept of a registered operator as opposed to the traditional term `vehicle owner' as a name in which a vehicle is registered and the requirement that vehicles must be registered in the same state as their principal base of operations helps to identify and curb some of the schemes that some of the smaller companies were using to beat taxation systems and some of the registrations that were historically operating under the section 92 regime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cost of implementing the scheme will not be met by the Commonwealth but by the states and territories. The NRTC estimates that the establishment cost of the scheme to the state vehicle registration authorities will be $12.4 million overall. However, the streamlined and efficient uniform registration system will provide benefits of around $10 million to those same authorities overall. Vehicle operators themselves are expected to gain around $14 million dollars in benefits, and I am quite confident that they will be very pleased, once the scheme settles down, with the paper warfare and the general administrative structures that will be in place, and with the fact that they will not be dealing with, in some cases, four or five individual state governments. Enforcement agencies are estimated to benefit by $1.5 million. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The introduction of a uniform scheme for both the registration of heavy vehicles and the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="411"> transporting of dangerous goods will bring about administrative savings as well as efficiency gains to the vitally important road transport industry. These are two early achievements in the development of uniform national road laws&mdash;an important micro&hyphen;economic reform in the road transport sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the other projects which the NRTC is also working on in order to develop uniform and consistent rules will hopefully bear fruit in the next few years. The commission has looked into the issue of truck driving hours, an issue which has been given considerable attention to date. I note that the shadow minister mentioned that in his contribution to the Committee. Presently, no two Australian jurisdictions have the same driving hour limits for truck drivers, thus creating significant difficulties for interstate operators to comply with the law, even if they had a genuine desire to do so. The commission is working towards a national system which could strike an appropriate balance between road safety, efficiency and current industry practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Meanwhile, the commission has initiated a training course for fatigue management in the trucking industry. Again, the shadow minister mentioned the considerable problem of the long hours worked by truck drivers. It is something that the management of the trucking companies, governments and individual Australians have been grappling with. I do appreciate some of the competitive pressures; on the other hand, we do need some form of regulation to ensure the safety of those operators, who sometimes drive 12&hyphen; or 14&hyphen;hour stretches, thus endangering both their own lives and the lives of other Australians in passenger vehicles. Anyone who has been on the Hume Highway would be very aware of the hazards that everyone faces.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VH4">Mr McARTHUR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And are terrified, as the honourable member interjects; and I agree with him. If some drivers are fatigued by doing a couple more trips than they should have done, that certainly endangers those big trucking rigs worth a quarter of a million dollars and more and also the individual Australians who can get caught up in a major accident. Meanwhile, the development of a nationally recognised log book is something which is always a bone of contention with truck drivers, in terms of whether they fill the log book in correctly, whether it can be challenged and whether it is a meaningful document through which to try to control the hours worked by truck drivers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other area to which the NRTC has directed its attention is the review of the mass limits which regulate the carrying capacity of trucking operators. Again, there is an argument as to whether trucks are overloaded. It is estimated, according to the NRTC annual report, that even a small increase in mass limits can generate big economic savings&mdash;as much as $1 billion over fifteen years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thus, the work of the National Road Transport Commission is far from over. The Chairman, John Hurlstone, and the Chief Executive, David O'Sullivan, will continue the long hard grind towards national standards and uniform laws for Australia's road transport sector. No one should underestimate the importance of these reforms. Just as we now transport containers from Brisbane to Perth on the national gauge line, which I mentioned, we can also truck goods by road with uniform road charges, registration requirements and rules for transport of dangerous goods throughout the whole nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is to be hoped that at some time in the near future Australians will have a national system of drivers' licences, road rules and road safety laws. This legislation could be a forerunner, if the federal parliament could persuade the states to adopt a national system in this area, so 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="412"> that we have a sensible national view of these regulations. As with gun laws, daylight saving hours and rail gauges, there seem to be significant benefits in having a national system which is consistent between the various state jurisdictions and known by all operators and all companies around Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope that the trend and the thrust of this legislation will help this parliament, in a bipartisan manner, develop further legislation which will bring about a more sensible approach to both the road transport system and the rail transport system. I have had a long and enduring interest in getting some uniform, sensible approaches to a standard gauge, one&hyphen;track Australia. I hope that the state rail authorities might have a sensible view as to how we can integrate a national rail system.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to speak in this cognate debate dealing with Road Transport Reform (Heavy Vehicles Registration) Bill 1996 and the Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Amendment Bill 1996. As the shadow minister, the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), has indicated, the opposition supports these bills. Indeed, why shouldn't we? They are just technical details and amendments to legislation that we brought in when we were in government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday, in this chamber, one of the members from the government, I think it was the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) in his contribution, said that people out there in voter land do not realise how much bipartisan legislation goes through this chamber, more so in this chamber than in the other place. It is true; a lot of legislation does go through here and this is a good example. I do not think there is disagreement between the government and the opposition on this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The heavy vehicles registration bill establishes a framework for a national registration scheme for heavy vehicles throughout Australia and provides uniform arrangements for initial registration, renewal, transfer, suspension and cancellation of registration, and the issue and clearance of vehicle defect notices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I understand it, the legislative framework will apply within the ACT and the Jervis Bay territory. Hopefully, as the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) said, it will be adopted by all of the states. More and more, especially with respect to transport matters, we have to look at having uniform legislation across all of the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The dangerous goods amendment bill makes a number of fairly technical drafting amendments to the bill passed when the Labor Party was in government. They are to be welcomed as they will form part of a system of nationally consistent road transport laws, which were first proposed as long ago as the Heads of Government Meeting in 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a nation we inhabit one of the most expansive land masses on earth. Our population is spread around the coastline and the nation is crisscrossed by roads. It is not the easiest task in the world to get agreement between the various states and territories of this country. With this legislation, there has been an amount of agreement and, as I said before, it is no easy task. There are people who argue that their state should be excluded, and someone mentioned the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="413"> gun laws. We hear various arguments as to why various states should be excluded from one piece of legislation or another but, unless we have all&hyphen;inclusive national legislation, the whole thing will not work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We, as a nation, rely more than most others on the road and rail network to transport goods and, indeed, to transport ourselves. The efficiency of our road transport system has been undermined in the past by inconsistent and contradictory road regulations. Many people have used the example of a truck going from Perth or Geraldton or somewhere else in Western Australia across to Brisbane, and have spoken about the various state laws that it would encounter and the regulations that would have to be complied with on that journey, instead of there being one set of laws and regulations to cover the whole journey. Each state and territory has had its own interpretation of the laws. In some states this has caused a delay in the economic development and has also involved many people in considerable cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These bills are an example of legislators and policy makers realising that Australia, with a diverse federation of six states and two territories, is in fact one nation. In 1992 the National Road Transport Commission was established, following agreement by the Commonwealth, states and territories to develop nationally uniform or consistent regulations relating to the construction and use of heavy vehicles. These bills establish the framework for the implementation of uniform legislation. It has been achieved by cooperation and consultation&mdash;as I said before, not always easy when you are dealing with diverse states and territories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are, though, a federation. Over the years people have often spoken about states rights, but surely in a nation as large and diverse as this we should, as legislators and policy makers, ensure that if nothing else our transport system is integrated and uniform according to a national standard. Such is the case with this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not many of us know what is transported by road. The previous speaker referred to the Hume Highway. I drive along the Hume Highway every week to and from Canberra and it is true that there are many, many trucks on it. There is an argument, as people have said, that a lot of what is transported by road should really be transported by rail, but I have always held that point of view. Nevertheless, so much is transported by road today. When I am driving along at my leisurely 90 or maybe up to 100 kilometres an hour I see trucks going past me doing 120 or 130&mdash;just going past me and going into the distance. Often the tarpaulins are flapping in the wind. I often wonder what dangerous goods are being transported in these trucks and what would happen if, as often happens, there were an accident or, as sometimes happens, something fell off one of these trucks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say that when I go past Goulburn it is always with a sense of relief that I turn off the Hume Highway onto the Federal Highway, because there are not as many trucks on that road and I do not have to be as concerned with what they are carrying and what would have happened if something had fallen off a truck. Often we do not know what these trucks are carrying until an accident occurs and someone is killed or injured or there is a spillage of chemicals or a fire. When there is a spill we read in the media the next day about the big clean&hyphen;up and how many people from the various towns along the highway had to be evacuated. Indeed, often it is only when the media gets hold of it that we learn of some of the dangerous goods that are being transported. We should be more aware of what is being transported&mdash;not only, incidentally, goods going by road but some of the chemicals that go round our coastline by ship as well. If there are ever leakages and spills off the coast they are going to have disastrous impacts.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="414">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is now a national uniformity and the vehicle operators are going to be subject to consistent regulations. No longer will there be a need or requirement for different licences or registrations to be held by vehicle operators travelling between different states and territories, transporting these goods throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation will also provide authorised officers with a greater range of powers to ensure industry compliance with the new regulations. All state and territory governments, and industry representatives, agree that the regulations will improve the administration and transportation of dangerous goods. The defence establishment has also supported moves to uniform national road laws and regulations, and aims to meet all of the rules and regulations unless special circumstances dictate otherwise. One would have to wonder what those special circumstances might be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the provision of the Defence Act 1903, Defence has scope to operate outside the rules and regulations of the states and territories under certain circumstances, such as when conducting operations or training. Discussions are well advanced between the Department of Defence and the Office of Road Safety to clarify further these remaining issues. The goal will be to fashion a Commonwealth position on the transportation of dangerous goods by Defence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to see that this legislation will not create inconsistencies of its own regarding the rail transportation of dangerous goods. The legislation ensures that rail transport is not excluded from the Australian dangerous goods code or the Australian explosives code. The federal Office of Road Safety has taken the initiative to ensure that rail requirements are written into the ADG code in a manner which will ensure complete consistency with road regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No matter what legislation is introduced, however, nothing will ensure that dangerous goods are transported more safely and efficiently than roads that are safe and in good condition. When there are the inevitable number of accidents over public holiday weekends&mdash;say, the Easter period or, as we have just seen, over the Christmas period&mdash;it is often said that driver fatigue, vehicle malfunction, alcohol, drugs and driving conditions are responsible for those deaths and injuries. A factor which is conveniently overlooked is the condition of the roads on which these people are killed or injured.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that the previous government had a very good record of funding road construction and improvements under the national highway system. In the years that I have been a member of parliament, I have seen the improvements on the national highway I travel on as I come down to Canberra and the improvements further down with the Yass bypass. Indeed, even now I see improvements along Lake George as they are working there&mdash;not that we can take credit for the Lake George improvement, but we can take credit for the others. I also strongly hold the view that the state and territory governments have much to answer for in the expenditure of the road funding which the Commonwealth allocates to them each year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The transportation of dangerous goods by road is hazardous at the best of times and I believe that this legislation will make that transportation throughout Australia much safer, more efficient and subject to uniform national rules and regulations&mdash;which is as it should be. I know that we often get complaints from truckies saying that their industry is overregulated. Knowing several truckies, I know they are always complaining about the fines, not always those on the big rigs on the national highways, but on timber trucks and the like. Some feel that they should be exempt from the law but, as the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) has highlighted, there is a lot of competition in this industry. It is not always the big 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="415"> national operators that break the law. It is often due to the very competitive nature of the cut&hyphen;throat industry they are in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my own area of the Illawarra there have been some horrendous accidents, especially when you are coming into Wollongong and coming down Mount Ousley or Bulli Pass where trucks have got away. Time and time again, when there is an examination of those trucks you find that there have been very serious defects. It is not always a matter of driver fatigue in that area. There was a case a couple of years ago where about six people were killed&mdash;a family wiped out&mdash;in a horrendous accident, and the driver had been forced by the owner to drive a vehicle that the driver knew had defects with the brakes and various other things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, while vehicles like that are on the roads we all use, I believe there should be very stringent conditions imposed, there should be regular inspections of the vehicles, and those who do not abide by the regulations should be hit with the book. I understand the very competitive nature of the industry, but there is no industry that needs to be so competitive that it is going to wipe out my family, your family or someone else's family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point I make is that it is all very well to talk about the transportation of dangerous goods, we have got to do a little more policing about the dangerous risks some of these people&mdash;not all&mdash;who transport these dangerous goods take. They do for all sorts of reasons, such as the hours that they drive and the pressure that they are under. Frankly, I would not like to be behind the wheel of one of those huge rigs because I would not like to have that responsibility and, frankly, I would not do it for the pay that they get either. They have a very responsible job but they are sharing the roads of Australia with many other vehicles. Onerous as it may be, and I know how annoying it is to many in the trucking fraternity to have spot inspections and to have to comply with all these things, it is very necessary legislation which I support very much. As the shadow minister said, the opposition supports this legislation and I commend the bills to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I intend taking only a few moments of the committee's time this morning in rising to support the Road Transport Reform (Heavy Vehicles Registration) Bill 1996 and the Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Amendment Bill 1996. Road transport is a very vital element to rural Australia, especially in the Northern Territory. It serves as an essential lifeline between our remote inland cities, particularly north of Alice Springs where there is no railway line. Hopefully, at some future stage, we might be able to rectify that. The road transport industry in the territory helps overcome the tyranny of distance that we face.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) said just a few moments ago that it was very important that we attain some form of uniform legislation by way of regulation. I believe that is quite true. Most of our freight comes from the southern cities. If a vehicle is leaving Victoria it has got to go through South Australia. If it is coming out of New South Wales it has got to go through Queensland. There are very large distances and it would be quite silly if each state had its own border patrol with different regulations. That would obviously put an impost on the transport industry by holding them up and not letting them flow to their timetable&mdash;and some have got very busy timetables, as we have heard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were some concerns last year when heavy motor vehicle registration fees were increased to maintain this uniform legislation. In fact, some of the registration fees in the Northern Territory for the big rigs went from about $2,500 to, in some cases, $8,500 to $9,000 per rig. There was some concern that the additional registration fees may have put a higher 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="416"> cost on the freight rates for the consumer. I am pleased to say that those in the territory transport industry have probably been very mindful of that and the charges that have gone on to freight costs have, I think, been reasonable. They have not been considered to be unreasonable anyway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The objectives of the Road Transport Reform (Heavy Vehicles Registration) Bill are to introduce conformity and consistency to regulations governing road transport nationwide. The reforms will not only increase the safety and efficiency of our transport industry, but should also lower the administration costs. The process of reforming our road transport industry began in the early 1990s, and 1992 saw the establishment of the National Road Transport Commission with the aim of developing a set of uniform regulations for the use and construction of heavy vehicles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I pick up another point that the honourable member for Throsby made. He said that he was pleased to be a part of the government of the time which introduced these new regulations for conformity and safety. But, at the same time, what is not generally known is that in some particular cases there was a lot of pressure put on the Northern Territory and Western Australia who were not happy with the particular proposal at that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact if my understanding is correct, at least in the Northern Territory, had the Northern Territory not conformed to that direction by the minister for transport that there should be uniform legislation then there may have been some fallback position that the minister may have taken in terms of maybe reduced funding levels for roads in the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nevertheless, having said that, we have now got the new regulations in force in the Northern Territory, registration fees have been increased and as I said, we do not believe that the higher freight costs that have been imposed on us by the industry in the Northern Territory have been unreasonable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many transport operators have found the system of different state and territory regulatory systems a burden on their business. The National Road Transport Commission called the system confusing and expensive to industry in its annual report of 1995&hyphen;96 and the administrative nightmare that the different regulations involved had a negative impact on the growth of the transport industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The heavy vehicle dangerous goods amendment bill is also about reform and uniformity of transport regulations. The bill is one step in the development of a national regulatory system for the transport of dangerous goods. It has three components. They are the broad framework provided by the act of 1995; the proposed regulations that will define the powers and the duties of those involved in transporting dangerous goods; and the sixth edition of the Australian Dangerous Goods Code, as mentioned by the honourable member for Throsby.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The public does have the right to feel safe and that a competent authority determines what goods are dangerous or not. This bill will provide for appropriate administration of these codes. Reflecting on the goods that are carried in the Northern Territory and South Australia, I note that the uranium oxide from Roxby Downs and Ranger mines certainly must be transported to a port. We are aware that there is no danger in the transporting of uranium oxide but the public perception is that if there were some kind of an accident there could be some problems associated with that spill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clause 2 repeals the current definition of the dangerous goods and the amendment broadens the definition. Other clauses of the bill relate to provisions of allowing further amendments by regulation. Obviously as we move towards uniform regulations it will be very time 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="417"> consuming to bring it back to the parliament every time there is going to be an amendment to the legislation. Part of the regulations provide the routes permissible for transporting dangerous goods. When one looks at the remote areas of Australia, I think the general community would be surprised at the size of the roadtrains and the type of cargo that they are carrying even taking into consideration the mining industry's activities in constructing new mines. In the case of wide cargoes, regulations are in place that insist that those people that are transporting wide loads or long loads must have an escort, forward and rear, of the convoy. At least it will make it a lot easier for those persons that are in the transport business to get permission to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Licensing drivers and vehicles for the purpose of transporting dangerous goods is another regulation process. As regards appropriate and safe packaging, it was mentioned by somebody earlier today that some of the loads being carried by the operators can give some reason for concern. Packaging is very important, not only for the transport operators but also for those people in the warehouses where it is stored.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also outlines procedures for documentation and checks by authorised officers. In fact there is a clause that relates to authorised officers, other than police officers, because each particular state does have its own road inspection system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously, it will make those officers' jobs a lot easier in checking the documentation because, as we have heard here earlier today, sometimes these drivers can be a bit tardy in providing the documentation necessary to meet all the standards. However, I am happy to support the provisions of the bill because I am aware that consultation has taken place between the states and the territories. Therefore, I commend the bills to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;According to the minister in his second reading speech, the two road transport reform bills before this parliament&mdash;the Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Amendment Bill and the Road Transport Reform (Heavy Vehicles Registration) Bill&mdash;are part of the regime of reformed road transport law being developed by Commonwealth, state and territory governments and the National Road Transport Commission to produce improvements in road safety and transport efficiency, as well as reductions in the costs of administering road transport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are very laudable goals and while I have no argument with many of these reforms, I wish to point out some of the downsides of these bills, particularly the heavy vehicles registration bill. The National Road Transport Commission argues that operators of articulated vehicles will enjoy most of the benefits of these reforms. The commission also argues that massive savings to our national transport costs will accrue from these reforms. However, it also admits much work needs to be done on our national bridge network, for the increased heavy vehicle limits that will come with these reforms, in combination with the new air suspension system, will not be user friendly to bridges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One wonders if these larger, heavier vehicles will reduce transport costs on the one hand but leave a legacy of taxpayer&hyphen;funded damage to our road and bridge system, thereby offsetting the benefits of such reduced transport costs. I believe there are already questions being raised about the claims made about the so&hyphen;called road friendliness of the air suspensions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister speaks of national uniformity with the introduction of these reforms but there is precious little uniformity in registration charging to date. Farmers will carry the burden of increased registration charges in New South Wales where charges are now well above those of other states. For example, a rigid truck with a gross vehicle mass limit over 20 tonnes, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="418"> configuration code 2R4, now costs $2,000 to register in New South Wales, just $187 in Victoria, $500 in Queensland and $1,200 in Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the minister pointed out in his second reading speech, the light vehicles agreement signed by heads of government requires the National Road Transport Commission to demonstrate significant net benefits before including light vehicles in the scheme. Due to the high implementation costs which would be incurred by registration authorities and the low estimated benefits, the commission recommended the legislation not be extended to all vehicles at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the Oberon council in my electorate has written to me detailing its concern with the national registration for heavy vehicles. This will impose an extra $11,000 in registration fees on the council, and the only source of funding that can provide this amount is from road maintenance and construction funds for regional and state roads. Hence, the costs to the community and our road network from road spending forgone because of these compliance costs are already becoming obvious.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Large transport operators are the beneficiaries of this bill. By the minister's reckoning there will be a $14 million saving for these operators, but I wonder what will be the costs to the community. The results could well be additional damage to regional, national and state roads caused by increased load limits and a further deterioration to the rural roads network which was never intended to cater for such volumes of heavy traffic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, in my own electorate, concerned residents are calling for the reopening of the Cumnock&hyphen;Molong rail branch line, such is their concern over the dangers from giant wheat trucks on local council roads, the dangers they pose and the obvious damage they cause to both sealed and unsealed roads.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The industry referred to in the minister's speech is the industry of the large transport operators, certainly not the smaller transport owners with a fleet size of less than 20 trucks. Many of the larger companies with fleet size of greater than 20 vehicles have already received massive benefits over and above those smaller operators. Accredited operators will be spared the frustration, delay, inefficiency and costs associated with differences in regulatory frameworks as they no longer have to comply under the alternative compliance regime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, those smaller operators who, for whatever reason, were not able to participate in the pilot schemes, will continue to suffer the frustration, delays, inefficiencies and costs associated with differences in regulatory frameworks and charging mechanisms. This is a lack of uniformity where smaller operators, particularly in country areas, suffer and lose competitive advantage to larger operators. Some operators will thus be targeted, while larger operators will be able to short&hyphen;cut or bypass the system through the alternative compliance arrangements. Increased road damage and increased accident rates could more likely be the result than the opposite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is debate about the representation of community groups on the deliberations that led to these amendments. I will recount a situation in my electorate over the last few years, where community action resulted in the total reform of a stretch of highway at Mt Lambie, near Lithgow, as a result of several serious truck accidents. Not only was that road reformed after several tragedies, but the total loading arrangements for wool bales was reformed thanks to the efforts of the people on the ground who saw a need and raised the pressure at a political level.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those same people&mdash;in my electorate's case the Highway Safety Action Group&mdash;sought access to some of the deliberations, just to put in the community point of view and to oversee, if they could, the deliberations that were under way, but they were denied access to the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rail closures&mdash;not only of state branches, but the downgrading of the importance of the main western rail line through central New South Wales, for example&mdash;have encouraged the growth of the massive and politically powerful transport industry. The rail access charges of the New South Wales state government are out by a factor of four, according to my information from TNT.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, the state government of New South Wales, it seems, is expecting the road transport operators who want to use rail to contribute in a very vast way to the infrastructure. I think it is going about it in entirely the wrong way. The government has a responsibility to provide that infrastructure, but not to charge rail access charges that are a distinct and deliberate disincentive, I believe, to keep more heavier and bulkier materials on road instead of rail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most of the visionary truck operators that I speak with want an integrated rail&hyphen;road network. They do not want to be forced onto road exclusively. The state government in New South Wales particularly should seriously reconsider just what sorts of returns it wants to get from its rail system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For all the rhetoric that safer roads and alternative compliance and bigger trucks means fewer trucks and, therefore, savings in transport costs, the real cost of not using rail is not factored into the equation. For all the regulations on hazardous goods included in the second bill under debate here, for all the reassurances to the community about the sorts of standards we will introduce to safeguard communities, and particularly other road users, the fact remains that the vast amount of long haul of hazardous goods should be done by rail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be churlish of me to ignore the benefits which the Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Amendment Bill will have on the road transport industry and the general community&mdash;albeit most of the dangerous goods should be on rail. The repeal of the current definition of `dangerous goods'&mdash;which currently reads `a substance or article prescribed by regulations as dangerous goods'&mdash;is a sound move, reading, as it will, `a substance or article determined by a competent authority in accordance with the regulations to be dangerous goods'. This will add that extra degree of security in the transport of dangerous and hazardous materials that, to a greater or lesser degree, has had too much of the `she'll be right mate' attitude about it to date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So too, the widening of regulations concerning the marking and packaging of both goods and vehicles carrying dangerous goods. So too I welcome&mdash;and so will the community&mdash;the extension of transport to include packing, loading and unloading. The other proposed paragraphs, amending powers to make regulations over routes and times that dangerous goods can travel; the licensing of vehicles and drivers; and the approval by competent authorities of dangerous goods packages, are welcome and overdue reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Item 16, repealing the right of the representative of a corporation to refuse to answer questions on the grounds of self-incrimination but retaining individual rights, is also welcomed, but one wonders if one can cancel out one right and leave the other. It goes somewhere towards tightening corporate responsibility for actions that do jeopardise the safety of the road user, and the general public. Item 18 follows this theme, providing much tougher penalties 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="420"> for corporations rather than individual drivers, for it ultimately is the responsibility of the company consigning such goods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Amendment Bill 1996 to the House with the reservations about transport of dangerous goods by road as opposed to rail that I have previously outlined. I have not the same level of enthusiasm at all for the Road Transport Reform (Heavy Vehicles Registration) Bill 1996 for the reasons I have also detailed. It takes this industry down the path of self-regulation and favours the major operators at the expense of the smaller, including local transporters and farmers amongst those smaller operators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us have uniformity, but also inclusivity. I suggest the road to alternative compliance, while lowering administrative costs to some, could end up costing the community far more.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to also support the Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Amendment Bill 1996 and the Road Transport Reform (Heavy Vehicles Registration) Bill 1996. I do not share the same concerns the member for Calare (Mr Andren) has just mentioned in relation to the Road Transport Reform (Heavy Vehicles Registration) Bill 1996 and I will come back to that in a minute.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will begin by talking about the first of these two bills, the one referring to dangerous goods transportation. The 1995 act was designed to ensure that the transportation of dangerous goods is carried out with maximum safety and efficiency. The act authorises officers, and gives them quite strong powers, to enforce safety rules and, in particular, uniform rules.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have all seen the consequences of a chemical spill on a road either in a built&hyphen;up area or in regional Australia. It is potentially extraordinarily dangerous. We have seen road accidents where noxious substances have spilt from the transport onto roadways and then into streams. In fact, last year there were examples where streams were contaminated by noxious substances, the result of a transport accident. We have seen fires and dangerous gas leaks when transports carrying dangerous substances have been involved in accidents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously, no bill, no piece of legislation, is going to entirely rule out problems to do with human error. Accidents will always happen, but a bill like this can go far in ensuring that we have regulations that are sensible. We have officers authorised to act in a way that ensures that they can enforce the rules. Therefore, I am very supportive, like others, of this particular amendment. In fact, this 1996 amendment, which is a technical refinement to the bill, will help to ensure that we have some of the most stringent dangerous goods transportation regulations in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the other bill, the Road Transport Reform (Heavy Vehicles Registration) Bill 1996, the key is that it will establish a national registration scheme for heavy vehicles throughout Australia. This is an essential component of the road transport reform now being developed in cooperation with the states, the territories, the Commonwealth, the National Road Transport Commission and, most importantly of all, the industry itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We can see that this bill ushers in a new era where, as a government, we do not simply employ rules and regulations and the big stick to ensure that they are complied with. We understand the essential nature of cooperation, coordination and consultation with industry. This bill is very much a consequence of a collaborative approach. In fact, our minister will be continuing that collaboration in the next few weeks with transport industry consultations in Hobart.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="421">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the new Road Transport Reform (Heavy Vehicles Registration) Bill 1996 we at last see sensible, rational, nationally consistent legislation. In my electorate our local economy is dependent on road transport. Unlike the member for Calare's experience, I have had overwhelming congratulations and support from the industry for these amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The road transport industry in Australia is an essential link in the chain connecting suppliers to buyers in all states. In Australia, the motor&hyphen;vehicle transport industry has been particularly important because we are such a vast continent and most of us do not have direct access to waterways. We are dependent on our roads. Our rail system is not a network that gives us adequate access to fast and efficient transport. There are too few kilometres of rail, with inefficiencies there that we are still dealing with. It is road transport that we depend on to a very large extent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Each summer sees rivers of grain, for example, flow off the farms onto the roads and on to the rail heads or down to the wharfs. As the member for Calare mentioned, a lot of those wheat transports are only small in comparison with some of the road trains we are familiar with in Australia, but they are a very essential part of the efficiency of the industry. The transportation of that wheat needs to be conducted in a safe and efficient manner and if there are nationally consistent regulations we can expect to see our farm produce, in particular, more cost&hyphen;effectively and efficiently transported.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are amongst the world's most cost&hyphen;effective dairy exporters. But a very substantial part of that cost efficiency is affected by the costs involved in transporting the raw milk off the farms to the manufacturing centres. With the plethora of red tape and regulation inconsistencies of the past, our road transport industry has not been as cost efficient as it needs to be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Every few cents added to a litre of milk, for example, makes us less export competitive; it makes us less competitive on our domestic markets, where we face competition from the New Zealand product and from the other overseas imported product, too often subsidised or on the verge of being dumped here. So this bill makes a very significant contribution to the economy of Australia. As well, it deals with issues of safety for those who are involved directly in driving our transports, for those who encounter the transports on the roads and those who are involved with loading vehicles and unloading.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ever since motorised trucking took over from the bullocks and horse wagons in Australia, we have had to contend with cross&hyphen;border inefficiencies. It is a legacy of our colonial past that every colony took, perhaps, in some senses, a great delight in ensuring that often they had their own quite idiosyncratic rules and regulations about things like the cost of registration, lighting required, allowable tonnages, safety requirements, speeds and so on when it came to vehicular transport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen transport operators actually shopping around from state to state to see which offers the cheapest and the most sensible regulatory regimes before they set up their businesses and apply for registrations. What a waste of time, a waste of mental effort, in having to do that. Even if the work of the transport operators was located in another state, we have seen businesses establish elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From time to time we have also seen the appalling time loss and added cost of valuable, fragile road freight being unloaded and reloaded at the borders, because the transport was not designed or registered in a way that is acceptable in the state next door. That is just an absurdity, and it has existed for far too long in Australia. At last we have a resolution of some of those absurdities.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="422">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I mentioned before, this bill also signposts a new, cooperative, highly productive relationship between government and industry, one of the most important industry sectors in the nation. The road transport forum in my electorate, the Goulburn Valley Road Transport Forum, is an industry sector that I work with most closely. Right now, together, we are identifying the particular road hazards that may be funded under the black spot program with federal funding moneys. That road transport forum, representative of small and large operators, knows that in this government it has a voice. We are working together to make sure that absurdities like eight different legislative, regulatory regimes will never happen again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is about reducing costs as well as about safety and consistency. We have to see in Australia where we can cut costs at every corner. Our government is committed to reducing regulatory red tape. It is amazing that some 20 per cent of the cost of all supermarket items tends to be a reflection of the transportation costs of getting those products onto the shelves. That is too much. At a time when we are seeing our market share of exported agricultural products decline, we have to see where we can assist our transport industry to sustain itself, grow and flourish.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nowhere is this legislation more welcomed than in regional Australia, in particular in my electorate of Murray. We are the only place in Australia which still has a processing fruit canneries sector, with two manufacturers&mdash;SPC and Ardmona&mdash;continuing to export and to thrive on the domestic market. We are totally dependent on road transportation of fruit to the factory and product to the wharves. Likewise, we are also the centre of Australia's dairy manufacturing, which is totally dependent on road transportation. Those industries are of such significance in our electorate that some 56 per cent of all employment in the Goulburn Valley is directly related to the transport sector. In fact, some 20 per cent of all road transports in Australia are registered in the Goulburn Valley and take the agriproduct&mdash;some 100 per cent of all Australian canned fruit and some 70 per cent of all dairy product&mdash;to the wharves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some 1.7 per cent of all employment in Australia is related directly to the truck transport industry and that industry grew by some 21 per cent between 1985 and 1993&mdash;an addition of 22,000&hyphen;plus jobs. We owe this industry a lot of respect. We owe it the best possible regulatory framework that any nation can produce, and in this bill we see the beginnings of major road transport reform. Yes, there is still some way to go with the smaller, lighter vehicles; that is still in the process of being worked out with industry. The industry understands that this government is committed to total reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Each year our road transport sector shifts freight worth some $60 billion. From time to time, we hear of horrendous trucking accidents where the drivers of the transports that are transporting such incredible volumes and value of freight have accidents. We often hear that those accidents are due to the fact that they have driven for too long, at too great a speed, and sometimes the taking of some medications has been involved. We would hope that regulations that are consistent nationally, like these, will help to overcome the health risks associated with driving and being involved in the transport sector. In particular, we will expect to see that road safety factors for all comers, both transport drivers and those who encounter the huge transports on the roads, are improved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am interested in the suggestion by the member for Calare that the increase that has been talked about in the size or mass of transports in the future will be at a major cost to the domestic economy. Yes, there is a problem with our bridges. No&hyphen;one denies that this country has been starved of road funding for the last 13 years. We have the most appalling situation 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="423"> where initially, when we&mdash;the coalition&mdash;introduced the whole business of federal road taxes, some 70 per cent of that excise was returned to road construction and maintenance. Unfortunately, under Labor, the proportion returned to road and bridge maintenance dropped to just seven per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yes, we know the bridges are in a shocking state; we know they will need to be upgraded. It will be a challenge for this government and this nation to try and find those funds in an extraordinarily difficult economic environment. On the other hand, we cannot pull back from having an efficient transport industry. When our economic export efficiency is dependent on efficient road transport, we cannot hold back the evolution of road transport industry development because there is a fear that some bridges might not take it. What we have to do is deal with both of these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am concerned that, with the condition of the current economy, we may not have the funds for the duplication of the Goulburn Valley Highway. However, I am assured by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) that he will do all in his power to see that the Goulburn Valley Highway will receive the funding for duplication. In the last 10 months we have seen 11 deaths on the unduplicated Goulburn Valley Highway, which has some of the highest levels of heavy road transport moving up and down it. Most of those accidents, which took out young families, involved trucks colliding with smaller family sedans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I acknowledge the concerns of the member for Calare (Mr Andren) about the condition of our roads and bridges. This legislation is dealing with an efficient, cost&hyphen;effective road transport sector. We have to deal with finding funding for our roads in an extraordinary environment. Our problem at the moment is the legacy, as I say, of our proportion of road excise over the years being turned into a greater proportion of general revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today, I have great pleasure in supporting these two bills, the Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Amendment Bill 1996 and the Road Transport Reform (Heavy Vehicles Registration) Bill 1996. Certainly regional Australia is dependent on the road transport sector being efficient and effective. All of Australia is dependent on safe roads. These bills will go a long way to achieving those ends.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Amendment Bill 1996 makes a number of technical drafting amendments to the Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Act 1995, which established a national regulatory scheme for the transport of dangerous goods by road. I am very pleased that the legislation initially governing this area of road transport activity was brought to bear by Labor in power.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We certainly had a vision to standardise the myriad of regulations relating to the transport of dangerous goods, which had evolved over time because of differing state jurisdictions. As the shadow minister mentioned in his remarks, the bill makes a number of amendments clarifying powers to make regulations, and it reflects changes in terminology arising from those proposed amendments. The opposition does not oppose the measures in this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the context of this debate on the Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Amendment Bill 1996, I would like to raise a matter of considerable concern to the electors of Corio. That matter relates to the transport of dangerous goods on the Princes Highway, which links the provincial city of Geelong with metropolitan Melbourne. This stretch of highway is one of the busiest in Victoria and it is used by many thousands of commuters both ways each day. With the opening of the western ring road, commercial and other traffic on the Geelong&hyphen;Melbourne highway has increased considerably.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="424">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am led to believe that the traffic on the western ring road, as I speak in this place today, is at a level in 1997 that it was anticipated by the experts to be at in the year 2006. That is quite a staggering statistic which has quite profound implications for economic geographers and city planners as they plot the future development of Melbourne and its environs, Geelong and its environs, and the rest of the state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Existing transport infrastructure, and the economics of moving freight around greater metropolitan Melbourne is pushing greater traffic and commercial activity into Melbourne's west and into the Melbourne&hyphen;Geelong corridor. As I said, this will have quite an effect on the location of future economic activity in that Melbourne&hyphen;Geelong corridor, and makes a case for a third lane on the Princes Highway between Geelong and Melbourne even more compelling. Sadly, with all the expertise available to the Victorian government, the government of Premier Kennett has yet to appreciate some of the substantial changes that are occurring because of the way in which the transport infrastructure is now generating economic activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recent reports published by the Victorian government on Melbourne's transport needs show that, according to the government, the network stops at the outer environs in the west and does not encompass the whole of the Port Phillip Bay area. Indeed, we ought to be looking at this whole area as an economic zone and looking for an integrated transport infrastructure that will deliver more efficient economic outcomes for the state and the nation in the longer term. Labor, under One Nation, commenced the task of upgrading the transport infrastructure in this area of the state of Victoria with the construction of the western ring&hyphen;road and its linkage with the Princes Highway, and the construction of a third lane of several kilometres on the Princes Highway leading out of Geelong. As has always been the case, it has been a Labor government with the vision to see the need for these projects and to commit the resources to bring them to fruition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the increase in traffic in the Geelong&hyphen;Melbourne corridor has implications for the transport of dangerous goods and for the regulation of heavy vehicular traffic flows between the two cities of Geelong and Melbourne. Geelong is a manufacturing city. It produces a range of products, such as explosives, petroleum, paints and other substances that rely on the input of toxic chemicals and other dangerous substances. The transport of these substances poses quite serious risks to workers and businesses using the highway on a regular basis each day. Local and state media regularly carry stories of oil and other chemical spills on this highway. It is these spills which cause severe disruption to the flow of commercial and private traffic over that stretch of the highway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, it is with great alarm and concern that the Geelong community views the Kennett government's proposal to relocate the Coode Island chemicals complex to Point Lillias near Geelong. The proposal is opposed on a number of significant grounds, one of which is the public hazard that will eventually flow from an increase on the Melbourne&hyphen;Geelong highway of heavy vehicular traffic carrying dangerous chemicals to the proposed storage facility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Already, around 30,000 vehicles travel every day over the Princes Highway and that stretch that I have explained, and double that number travel between Werribee and Melbourne. It is estimated that, with the construction of the East Coast Armaments Complex and the relocation of Coode Island, these developments alone will increase heavy vehicular traffic and truck journeys by around 600 per day, thus creating a huge safety problem for the region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That safety concern is compounded by the rundown of Geelong's fire fighting capacity by the Kennett government. I met recently with Geelong firefighters, and I heard at first hand 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="425"> how their capacity to protect the public when dangerous chemical spills occur has been diminished by state government cutbacks. The situation would be a dangerously critical one in the case of a major accident at the Point Lillias site.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the firefighters of Geelong for their dedication to their profession and to the Geelong community. They have long argued that these cutbacks are not in the public interest. They argue that case not from a selfish point of view in terms of protecting their employment but from the realities of the resources that are being made available by the state government and the myriad tasks they are now called upon to perform. We need a firefighting capacity that can respond quickly to accidents and protect the travelling public, and we do not have it at the moment. These public road safety concerns are but some of many that the Geelong community has with regard to the establishment of a petroleum and chemical storage facility at Point Lillias. The power to stop the Point Lillias development lies with the Minister for the Environment, Senator Hill, who is currently considering this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth has an international obligation under the Ramsar convention to protect the Point Lillias area as a habitat for endangered migratory bird species such as the orange bellied parrot. Now that might not seem so significant to many and, indeed, the Victorian Premier does not consider it so. He regards the orange bellied parrot as just another trumped up corella. Any environmental vandal or environmental imbecile, which I suspect the Victorian Premier is, should appreciate that endangered bird species are a matter of international concern. They are a matter of international negotiation and a convention, which Australia has signed, to protect the wetlands of these very important and endangered species.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the Point Lillias area is a wetland area of international significance and I urge Senator Hill again, on behalf of the Geelong community, to exercise his Commonwealth powers and stop the Point Lillias development. The Victorian government's proposal to excise 20 hectares from the Point Lillias area currently protected by Ramsar to achieve the Coode Island relocation must be rejected by Senator Hill. Above all, Australia's international reputation in environmental matters must be protected. If the Point Lillias development proceeds, as I explained, the traffic of dangerous chemicals and dangerous goods on that stretch of highway between Melbourne and Geelong will be increased substantially.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is, therefore, with considerable concern that I noted the recent letter from the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to Senator Hill, apparently endorsing the Victorian government's position on Point Lillias, and stating to Senator Hill, `You are in a position to respond expeditiously to the Victorian request'. It would seem to me that the Prime Minister is indeed endorsing the Point Lillias development and it is one which will compound the difficulties that we already face on the Princes Highway with the carriage of dangerous goods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My esteemed colleague the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) pointed out in her press release of 30 January 1997:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is clear that Senator Hill's own bureaucrats do not consider the Victorian government's submission has clearly demonstrated the relocation is in the urgent national interest.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is the only basis on which the Victorian government can argue that this 20 hectares ought to be excised from the Ramsar protected areas for Coode Island to be relocated to Point Lillias. Indeed, those bureaucrats that I mentioned before have been sent away to prop up the Victorian submission and to come up with a new position that is defensible in the international arena.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Might I remind the Prime Minister and Senator Hill that the Geelong community has a strong and different view of how this area ought to be developed. The Prime Minister, Senator Hill 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="426"> and cabinet ministers are aware of proposals to develop Avalon airport and its environs as a dedicated freight centre for the export of fresh produce to Asia. The government has already leased the airport to the Foxerco consortium, and trucking magnate Lindsay Fox, who is a key player in that consortium, has endorsed the Avalon vision. It is poised for massive development. The employment gains to the region are estimated at over 5,000. The gains to the national export effort and to the balance of payments are estimated in the billions of dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is in the urgent national economic interest that the Avalon development proceed and the Victorian government's proposal to locate a chemical storage complex in the Point Lillias area is squashed. The Prime Minister knows of the implications of the decision that must be made with regard to the Point Lillias development. As I mentioned, it is this Point Lillias development that is going to exacerbate the problem that we already have on the highway with regard to the transport of dangerous goods, which is the subject of the bill before this Main Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer the Prime Minister to a letter that was sent to him on 2 February by Ross Mellor, the facilitator and coordinator of the Habitat Trust, in which he points the Prime Minister to the implications of the decisions that are about to be made by the federal government on land use in this whole area. I commend Mr Mellor and Mr Elio Comello of the Habitat Trust for the excellent work they have done in elevating the Avalon proposal&mdash;the vision that the Geelong community has for this area of the state&mdash;in the halls of the state and federal governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Mellor has this to say to the Prime Minister:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We wish to state to you that there are a number of the members of your Cabinet who are acutely aware that the establishment of the chemical facility at Point Lillias adjacent to Avalon Airport Geelong will directly, injuriously and adversely mitigate against the establishment of the Australian National Fresh Food export system now being established at Avalon Airport, the sale of which has been confirmed to Foxerco Pty Ltd. . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fresh food is the key to a major national export system and apparent contamination by association with a chemical facility will directly and seriously affect the export capability through the Avalon airport. The extent of this project and what is at stake can best be represented by estimated employment and gross export values within seven years of now&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And Mr Mellor is a little more expansive in the employment gains that he claims will be achieved at Avalon&mdash;70,000 in south&hyphen;east Australia&mdash;and exports over a 10&hyphen;year period of $45 billion to $55 billion. He concludes  his letter to the Prime Minister with the statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is very clear that the `urgent national interest' requires that the Point Lillias chemical facility not be proceeded with and all associated with the major national export project trust that you comprehend the national significance of the issue.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I draw the Prime Minister's attention to the alternatives that are there in the way that this area of land around Avalon airport might be used. The Prime Minister can support a Victorian government proposal that is going to see the relocation of a chemical storage facility to Point Lillias, with employment gains that are estimated at 60&mdash;I repeat, 60&mdash;or the Prime Minister can choose in the national interest to pursue a development at Avalon airport which we conservatively estimate will deliver 5,000 jobs in the immediate environs and contribute massively to the national export effort.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="427">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Geelong Advertiser</EMPHASIS> only today, an economist, Mr Francis Grey, in a brief prepared by his organisation, Economists at Large and Associates, said this about the relocation of the chemical facility at Coode Island to Point Lillias:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Relocating the chemical facility would risk industry opportunities that were likely to offer `greater wealth creating potential and hence significant sustainable employment'.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So there is an economist saying that the choices to the government are quite clear and they are very stark indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister and his cabinet colleagues can walk the road of a proposal that merely props up an inadequate and unsubstantial submission by the Victorian government on Point Lillias or it can opt for a benign economic development, an environmentally compatible economic development, that will deliver staggering gains to the national economy and to the local regional economy. The upshot for the Geelong region of the Prime Minister and his colleagues making a decision on the former is that not only will the region be shortchanged and not only will the nation be shortchanged but the important stretch of highway between Geelong and Melbourne will be clogged up with heavy vehicular transport carrying dangerous chemicals and endangering the public that use that road every day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I mentioned, there is already a compelling case now, with the developments that have occurred with the expansion of the western ring road activity, for a third lane to be built on the highway between Geelong and Melbourne.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government must look seriously at this now and it must commence its budgetary planning to give effect to this infrastructure development over the next five years. That development will be important to the economic growth of the state of Victoria and indeed to the national economy especially if the Avalon development is given a fair go by this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Hill knows the implications, the Prime Minister knows the implications and the minister for transport knows the implications of the decisions that are already now on the deck and facing this cabinet. I hope in the interests of the Geelong community that the correct decision is made. I hope in the interests of the national economy that the government shows some good sense and backs away from the tacit approval that the Prime Minister has given to the Kennett government Point Lillias proposal and supports a development that will deliver such substantial economic benefits to the national economy.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are all aware of the term `dangerous goods'. It means different things to different people, but it pleases me to see that a competent authority will now make that decision in respect of specific subject matter, in accordance, of course, with the regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also very good to see that the regulations now impose a duty of care on manufacturers of dangerous goods to be transported and of vehicles and containers that are being used to convey such goods by road.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If every care is taken by all parties involved in the transportation of dangerous goods, from packaging to storage, vehicles to drivers and of course on the road, then we will be able to maintain a very low accident ratio.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="428">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill imposes the requirement on the parties involved, from the bottom to the top, and will ensure safety is a prerequisite of all aspects of transporting the goods from one place to another.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">`Dangerous goods' can be classified as both live and dead, but potentially all of them have the capacity to create a natural disaster of momentous proportions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dangerous goods such as explosives, gas and fuel, and radioactive materials are regularly used in our everyday existence and have to be transported all over the country on a daily basis. The forms of transport we use demand that these goods are transported in large quantities, and because of this any accident has the potential to be catastrophic, no matter whether it occurs on an isolated highway or in a busy town centre.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our roads are not necessarily always safe. Nearly 2,000 people die on our roads from motor vehicle accidents every year. This does not include those accidents which only result in injury or where no injury occurs and only damage is caused.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When it comes to dangerous goods, any of these scenarios will cause a very serious problem and the best trained, equipped and operated emergency teams from the ambulance and fire services will not be able to prevent a major accident involving dangerous goods from happening or from causing serious problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have all seen the damage and destruction that can occur when an oil tanker leaks its load into the ocean; especially from an environmental point of view we have all seen what can happen to a community when bushfires get out of control. However, a considerable number of dangerous goods that are transported on our roads every day can cause a far greater catastrophe in our communities. We cannot allow this to happen and this bill goes a long way to ensure that all proper precautions are taken by the responsible parties involved in the transportation of dangerous goods and any abuse of this act will result in very heavy penalties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another praiseworthy amendment to the bill is the replacement of subsection 42(5) which now requires that a company must actually be convicted of an offence against the act before a director of the company may be deemed liable for that offence, with the requirement that the company must have committed the offence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If a company is found guilty of an offence against the act, then the company director must be held responsible and should not be able to avoid liability. This alone will ensure that all precautions are taken, and preventative measures are put in place to safeguard the company and its directors. As a consequence of this amendment we will see company directors making sure every aspect of their operation is as foolproof as can be, and all rules and regulations are abided by. This amendment alone will enhance the safety criteria of the transportation of dangerous goods industry overnight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments to this bill will also give the competent authority the ability to allow regulations to be made both to the licensing of vehicles and drivers for the purpose of transporting dangerous goods, and to the licensing of people responsible for the transport of dangerous goods or for vehicles used in that transport. This amendment will ensure that the issue of safety is the responsibility of all licensed parties involved in the transportation of goods, and will provide a number of checks and balances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Safety has to be the most important issue when it comes to the transportation of dangerous goods. Our major roads are very busy thoroughfares and our minor roads are often in a state of disrepair. Therefore, it is imperative that every conceivable action is taken to prevent any 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="429"> form of accident from occurring. With all parties involved in the transportation of goods properly accredited and responsible professionals, the risk of potential accidents on our highways and byways is reduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia has a massive road transport system, on most of which, as the general public sees it, potential accidents are waiting to happen. It is in turn thought by many that more of the dangerous goods distributed through this great nation should be on the rail system, and I must say that this is a hard point to argue. However, with possible industry changes and changes in perceptions within the rail system this may become reality in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These amendments now give a breath of fresh air that, should an accident occur, the necessary emergency crews can be contacted immediately to bring the response times to an absolute minimum, this assistance coming from the fact that any of the travelling public will now be able to immediately recognise the threat posed by the goods of carriage. The threat is what the emergency services crew need to know so that, regardless of how far this crew have to travel, they will know the plan of attack that is required in order to render the dangerous goods safe. This information comes from a simple system of placarding which is long overdue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, I draw your attention to the carriage of liquid petroleum gas, this being one of the most dangerous goods we have on today's roads. In the event of an accident, a subsequent fire brings on the danger of a BLEVE, a boiling liquid expanding vapour explosion. Should some LPG gas cylinders become heated and explode, the potential to kill those standing in the vicinity becomes very real. This legislation provides immediate information to the emergency services of the threat, in turn sending a clear and concise message to the emergency services of the possible need to evaluate the immediate area, street or even suburb.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation will save lives and I commend the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) for having the foresight to listen to the industry and to give it what it wants, not what some bureaucrat in an office says, who has no knowledge of what is really required. I commend to the House the amendments to the Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Act.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AJ4">Mr Sharp</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Nil. During 1995/96 Commonwealth assistance for urban flood mitigation was primarily administered under the National Landcare Program as part of general assistance for floodplain management. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy is responsible for the National Landcare Program. There was no separate treatment of "urban flood mitigation" versus "rural flood mitigation" under the National Landcare Program in 1995/96 nor in the earlier years of operation of this Program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Assistance for urban floodplain management was the responsibility of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy until the end of 1995/96. Urban flood elements of the National Landcare Program and associated funds were transferred to my Department for inclusion in the Urban Flood Mitigation Program which was due to begin operation in 1996/97. As you know, the Commission of Audit reported on this matter and the Government subsequently abolished the Program as a savings measure in the Budget context.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) My advice is that work is ongoing in urban floodplain management with the support of the NSW Government and local governments. This 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> issue is essentially one of State and local government responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) As a result of the program rationalisation measures the Government has had to make, the funds available for urban flood mitigation will be less than in recent years. However, through the Natural Disaster Relief  Arrangements (NDRA) administered by the Department of Finance, the Commonwealth will continue to provide reimbursement for State expenditure on a range of eligible relief measures, where State expenditure exceeds an agreed funding threshold under the NDRA formula. In the event of severe future flooding in the south western Sydney area, Commonwealth funding assistance will continue to be available, provided that the disaster meets the eligibility criteria under the NDRA determination.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The Government believes it is important that there be an assessment of the appropriateness of the Commonwealth's involvement with commercial business units such as the APS. The Government is awaiting the results of a review of the APS. Until this review is complete and recommendations are made to the Government, it would be inappropriate to signal any change in attitude to organisations such as the APS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The function of the Australian Public Service, as defined in section 6 of the Australian Protective Service Act 1987, is to provide protective and custodial services for and on behalf of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="432"> Commonwealth as the Minister directs.There are, therefore, statutory, constitutional and Ministerial limits on the functions of the APS but they are not prohibitions as such. Each case is examined on its merits to establish whether it falls within statutory and constitutional bounds. Where that is the case, I may direct that a particular matter may be undertaken as a function of the APS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The security services for the National Crime Authority were untied from the APS by the former Government. The NCA put services to tender and these were awarded to a private sector firm. This is the only work previously done by the APS that has been awarded to the private sector at this stage.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)(a)(i) The bearer's account is credited on the day the cheque is deposited with their financial institution. However, funds are generally not available for withdrawal until such time as the cheque is cleared. The five day clearance cycle for cheques is an industry standard and individual agreements can be negotiated with banks to allow some customers to draw against particular cheque deposits within the five day period. In such situations, the bank in question is making a commercial judgement that the cheque will be paid, or that in the event of dishonour it can recover the funds it has allowed its customer to withdraw. For example, customers are often able to immediately draw on bank cheques, cheques from the RBA, and cheques for the payment of wages.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YT4">Mr Bruce Scott</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) At the end of December 1996, major financial institutions offered "pensioner deeming accounts" to service pensioners. These accounts replicate the current deeming rules in offering 5% and 7% to depositors, depending on the total balance. Currently, some financial institutions also offer 5% for the first $2,000 invested in pensioner deeming accounts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the reduction in deeming rates to 4% and 6% effective from 23 January it is expected that the interest rates for pensioner deeming accounts will also reduce to 4% and 6%.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) At the time this initiative was developed there were an estimated 121,000 service pension accounts that attracted less than 5%, with the approximate number of service pensioners affected being 100,000. The average reduction of service pension under the current deeming rates is estimated at less than $1.00 per fortnight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Pensioners who lose pension can actually increase their overall income by choosing to place their money in investments which return at least the `below threshold rate', currently 5%, on the first $2000 (for single pensioners) or $4000 (for pensioner couples). Whilst assessing more interest may mean a lower pension rate, the total income for the pensioner would go up because the pension only reduces by $0.50 for each $1.00 earned. Pensioners who will not be affected by this initiative are those with small amounts of financial assets, that is single pensioners with less than $44,900 and pensioner couples with less than $78,100.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Estimated savings are $349,000 in the financial year 1996/97 and $2.467m in a full year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">For your information: Effect of Change to Deeming Rates:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the reduction in deeming rates to 4% and 6% from 23 January 1997 there will be some impact on these estimates of the number of pensioner accounts affected. However, on current figures available it is not possible to determine the extent of this impact. We can indicate that the amount of financial assets pensioners can have without being affected by this initiative will increase to $49,573 for single pensioners and $91,201 for pensioner couples.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Employment data specific to the banking sector are not available.

This fall can be attributed to a number of factors; technological advances will have created some specific job losses, saved some jobs which would otherwise have been lost, and created some new job opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The time it takes a bank to clear a cheque is a function of the time needed to transport, process and check the authenticity of the cheque, plus an allowance for the time it takes for any advice of dishonour to reach the institution where the cheque was deposited. The Australian Payments Clearing Association (whose membership includes banks, building societies and credit unions) is involved in a project using technological advances to facilitate electronic presentment of cheques and electronic communication of a dishonour, with the objective of reducing cheque clearance times. The Australian Payments Clearing Association believes that the current 5 day clearing cycle should be able to be reduced to 3 or 4 days without increasing the risk that the dishonour advice is received after the cheque proceeds are drawn down.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Estimated total expenditure for the Department on paper products since April 1996 to December 1996 is approximately $2.0m*, comprising approximately $0.7m on general office requirements and $1.3m on paper stock for publications and forms produced by the Department. This estimate is based on figures from the Department's contractor for forms and publications, and a pro rata amount of the total expenditure on general office requirements for the 1994/95 financial year, discounted to take account of reduced consumption due to reduced staff numbers from August 1996.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) and (2) The Commonwealth, with the assistance of all States and Territories, compiled a preliminary report on the availability and nature of palliative care in Australia in early 1996. The report was presented to the Australian Health Ministers' Advisory Council in February 1996. The report identified that there was a wide range of palliative care services available in a variety of settings; that there was maldistribution of services, eg, between urban and rural areas; and that further studies were needed to identify the level of need for palliative care and the real level of resources required and being allocated to palliative care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Palliative care is provided in a variety of settings, including homes, hospices and hospitals. The emphasis of initiatives funded by the Commonwealth for palliative care has been holistic care provision focussing on domiciliary service provision rather than inpatient care. "Number of beds" has therefore become inadequate as a measure of service provision as it does not reflect either the total provision of services nor the level of need. In order to develop more appropriate measures, the Commonwealth has funded projects to develop standard data definitions and performance indicators for palliative care services which will enable better identification of the level of need for these services and the real level of resources allocated to palliative care.</PARA>
