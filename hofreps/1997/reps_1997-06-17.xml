<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer to the question to me on 4 June from the member for Canberra concerning cleaning services. Limro had advised their cleaning staff in Parliament House of a proposal&mdash;to take effect in four weeks time&mdash;of a change to their early shift start time from 4 a.m. to 6 a.m. No change has been made. Limro's written advice to their workers was that a change to shift times was proposed from 30 June. The proposal was suspended following the hearing in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission on 4 June 1997.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Limro was formally advised by the Joint House Department that the implications of the proposed changes would be considered after consultation with building occupants. Initial consultation has taken place with the chamber departments and the ministerial support branch of DAS. Party whips and some senators and members, particularly those who are frequent early attendees, will also be individually consulted. A summary of outcomes from the above consultative process and the resultant departmental response to Limro's proposal will be studied before the proposal is accepted, modified or rejected. Limro states that:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Treasurer. The Treasurer would be aware of the high mortgage holders in my electorate. Can the Treasurer advise the House of the results of the latest home loan affordability report? What part have the government's budget repair, low inflation and low interest rate policies played in achieving this result?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="5354" SPEAKER="Costello, Peter, MP" NAMEID="CT4" ELECTORATE="Higgins" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Treasurer" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CT4">Mr COSTELLO</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Deakin for his question. I am aware of the number of home buyers in the electorate of Deakin, an electorate that I have a great deal of familiarity with. I know that the member for Deakin will be pleased to know that the latest Citibank&hyphen;REIA home loan affordability indicator released yesterday showed that home loan affordability rose 5.1 per cent in the March quarter for 1997 and 16.7 per cent over the year&mdash;the strongest annual growth in four years. The Commonwealth Bank&hyphen;HIA housing affordability index showed even stronger growth: affordability increasing 6.4 per cent in the March quarter 1997, following a five per cent increase in December 1996. This makes housing the most affordable since this indicator began in December 1984.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reductions in the home loan standard variable interest rate which have occurred under this government mean that on the average Australian mortgage of $100,000 the interest savings are $292 per month&mdash;$292 per month after tax  money as a result of lower interest rates. Not only are home buyers and young families reaping the benefits but business is benefiting from reductions in interest rates as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's policy to engage in fiscal consolidation and lower interest rates was fought every step of the way by the Labor Party. The Labor Party had a policy of keeping interest rates high in this country. The Labor Party got interest rates up at the end of 1994 and fought to prevent them coming down. Those opposite fought every fiscal 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> consolidation measure&mdash;every single one of them&mdash;and then, just for good measure, the ALP went into the national wage case to argue for an increase in wages to try and kick inflation higher and put more people out of jobs. We can be pleased that the Industrial Relations Commission rejected the submission of the Australian Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people of Australia supported the government in its fiscal consolidation efforts and as a result interest rates have fallen and the conditions have been set for small business and home buyers. On station 4BH on 17 June 1997 Mark Silver from the REIQ said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it's a very exciting time for Queensland's property market there are good things in the front, I think we have got a fiscally responsible Federal Budget.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is what he said this morning.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LS4">Mr MARTIN FERGUSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Acting Prime Minister. It goes to the question of high unemployment and the real reason interest rates are going down. Do you realise that in trend terms the number of long&hyphen;term unemployed hit 242,500 today, a two&hyphen;year high and 28,000 more than when the government began slashing job programs exactly 12 months ago? Isn't it a fact that the government's attitude to the jobless is demonstrated by the insensitive comments of Mr Howard when he asked the unemployed to be patient? When will we see an end to a policy of smokescreens to avoid offering real vision, understanding and leadership on job creation?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Clearly there can be no complacency with regard to creating more jobs and reducing the unemployment levels, but I remind the House that this government, under the Costello budget, will spend in fact 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5355"> $1.15 billion on labour market assistance in the next financial year. Further, we have facilitated, through the budget strategy and the good discipline of the budget strategy, four consecutive interest rate reductions, which in turn are now starting at long last to flow through to small business, to flow through to primary producers&mdash;whether it be our hard&hyphen;pressed citrus primary producers or drought&hyphen;affected primary producers&mdash;and to in fact provide a confidence and a circumstance of borrowing capacity at a far more realistic interest rate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might add, with regard to our handling of it, that the labour market assistance will be client focused, not program driven. Employment services providers will be paid on their performance in placing job seekers in employment. Job seekers will benefit from higher standards of service, more flexible and customised assistance and ultimately better and more lasting employment outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am always a little bit bemused when the ex&hyphen;President of the ACTU asks questions about unemployment and would be even more so if the Leader of the Opposition was game enough to put his head up on this matter, because I have a bit of paper here which reminds me that in fact the unemployment rate hit an all&hyphen;time historic high in December 1992, in the middle of his period as Minister for Employment, Education and Training. That was 11.2 per cent. We are getting on with the task; you clearly failed in that task.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services.

How will the new Medicare agreements impact on the government's policies on access to quality and affordable health care?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="5355" SPEAKER="Wooldridge, Dr Michael, MP" NAMEID="8E4" ELECTORATE="Chisholm" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Health and Family Services" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8E4">Dr WOOLDRIDGE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. I am pleased to advise the House there has been some encouraging progress so far in attempting to renegotiate new agreements. The current ones expire on 30 June next year. There are a number of problems that public hospitals have, and we 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> are trying to address these in the agreements that we are negotiating. There are no incentives at the moment for appropriate ambulatory care. There are no incentives for appropriate sub&hyphen;acute care, research and teaching are being squeezed in public hospitals, and people have an understandable concern that quality issues may not be being addressed. These agreements are the best chance we get in any five&hyphen;year period to appropriately address these issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also concerned that there are not appropriate linkages between what happens in hospital and what happens in the community. Clearly if we are going to provide the best possible health care, we have to improve those linkages. So we are optimistic that these can be addressed and, in recognition of this, health ministers have agreed that the next agreements should be called `Australian health care agreements' as they will be broader agreements than in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are working around four main areas. The first area is the acute in&hyphen;patient services, and we are looking at links between hospital based services and post&hyphen;acute care. The second area is ambulatory services, which is outpatients and other services like that, and we are trying to put incentives into the system that will give appropriate incentive for having people treated where it is most appropriate, not where costs can be shifted from one level of government to another.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third area is broadly called `other elements'&mdash;teaching, research and quality issues. Teaching is important because the community deserves an appropriate number of specialists in all different professions and particularly in medical areas such as dermatology or radiation oncology. Those areas have been squeezed and we are not going to meet the community's future needs unless we can find a way of putting that training into an appropriate funding context.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, if we are going to progress in the policy area, we have got to have appropriate data development and sharing, and this is something where Australia, at a Commonwealth level, has led the world. If we can integrate state and Commonwealth data and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5356"> share it appropriately, we will have something that will be the envy of many countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These agreements are never easy, as it is a very major part of any state government expenditure. I would not pretend that in the past they have been anything but long, bloody, drawn&hyphen;out affairs and it may be that, in the end, this is what will happen with this agreement. But I would say that so far that has not been the case. Health ministers have met six times in the last 15 months and that compares with one occasion in the two years up to the last election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For that reason, it is somewhat disappointing to find one newspaper today attempting to create some discord where in fact there is none. Health ministers have been working on this, realising that here we have a unique opportunity for those who have to make the system work on a day to day level to try and get it right. Of course, if we are unable to do this we would expect others to do it for us. But it would be rather unique in health if those who cared about the system and those who had to manage the system had the chance to drive reform in the system into something that was, in the end, in the interests of patients.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To give one example, I opened some what are called cardiac flats at the Austin Hospital in Melbourne a couple of weeks ago, with the member for McEwen. These flats enable people who are having heart surgery to go out into a halfway house on day four, rather than to continue in the hospital. They are linked to the hospital; they have a nurse visit in the morning and in the evening, they can go down and get their own meals and they can have their husband or wife move in with them for the recovery. It is voluntary&mdash;70 per cent of people choose to go that way&mdash;and the Austin Hospital has been able to reduce its heart surgery waiting list from 600 to zero in a nine&hyphen;month period, just by better utilisation of its beds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Previous agreements have tended to be just arguments about money. Money is, of course, an issue in hospitals but so is appropriate use of services, so is appropriate sub&hyphen;acute care, so are appropriate linkages with the community and so is appropriate ambulatory care. I do 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> not underestimate the difficulty of reform but the signs so far are encouraging.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. With respect to the 139 Chinese boat people from Fujian Province in China attempting to enter Australia illegally, is this the largest single incursion of illegal immigrants since the 1850s? Does the fact that this ship was bound for the east coast of Australia and that all the illegals had haircuts and smart new suits indicate that Australia is being targeted by Fukienese crime gangs, as are the US, Europe and Japan? Does this sort of operation suggest that logistical support will need to be provided in Australia?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I certainly can confirm to the honourable member that there was an arrival in Australia of a boatload of 139 individuals whom we believe intended to come here for what appear to be immigration purposes. They were certainly unauthorised. We believe them to be from the People's Republic of China. All of them have now been transferred to the immigration reception and processing centre at Port Hedland and inquiries are being undertaken at this very time in relation to the way in which they sought to come here and the extent to which it was organised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I take on notice the comments that the honourable member has offered. I cannot confirm any of those observations, although it is clear that there have been, at various times, attempts by people who have come from China to enter the United States. There was the very tragic sinking of a boat in New York harbour not so long ago that was well known publicly. This case is very unusual in that a steel&hyphen;hulled vessel that was specially acquired for the purpose of this voyage to Australia was used, it had sophisticated navigational devices on it and these people who were intent on reaching Australia presented in a very different way from others we 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5357"> have seen before. Certainly this journey would not have taken as long and was in no way as hazardous as those of many who have embarked upon these journeys before.</PARA>

The fact is that the Labor Party has been obsessed with the 30 per cent of students who are going on to university from school and has completely neglected the interests of the 70 per cent of students who are not going on directly to university from school.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed, Mr Speaker. The government recognises, as the former government did not, that young people are the most disadvantaged group within the labour market. The government is responding to these changes with a variety of innovative strategies, including opening new opportunities for schools. One of the most important innovations that the government is making is inviting schools to take responsibility for the job placement of their students.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two government programs which provide schools with these opportunities. One is the jobs pathway program, which has already completed the first tender round. Two schools tendered successfully in that program, and I am pleased to tell the House that they had a 100 per cent success rate&mdash;the first time this has happened in Australia. The second tender round is now under way, and I invite schools to tender for the some 70 contracts that the government will be writing which will aim to help students in up to 1,000 schools. There will also be an opportunity later this year in the tendering out of the job placement services of the CES when, again, schools will be able to tender for labour exchange services and entry level training support services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The President of the Australian Secondary Principals Association has endorsed these policies of the government, and said that principals and teachers want to help their students find permanent jobs. There is an endorsement right across the community except from the Labor Party and except for the Carr government. The Carr government has made it clear through its Minister for Education, Mr Aquilina, that it will not permit schools in New South Wales to tender for these services. Indeed, Mr Aquilina has said:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Adelaide for her question. I know that she has been concerned, on behalf of her constituents, about this issue and indeed I know that many members of the House and many members of the community have been concerned about this. Senator Alston, the Minister for Communications and the Arts, has indicated that he has some concerns too about the processes of the anti-syphoning rules which we inherited obviously from the former government. The incapacity of these rules to work to proper advantage was exhibited during the South African telecasts. Again we have seen decisions by Channel 9 which the minister has expressed his regret about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has indicated that we will take broadly three steps to address the problem. Firstly, we expect to bring legislation into the parliament in the spring session. I would hope that the opposition would give support to the legislation. We want to prevent television stations from buying the rights to events on the list and then hoarding them so that others who are interested in telecasting them are prevented from doing so. Secondly, we want to differentiate between the live and the delayed rights, which was the cause of the South African debacle to which I referred in answer to a previous question from the opposition in this place. This will maximise the possibility of viewers receiving as much live coverage of these events as possible. Thirdly, and the member will be pleased about this, we are looking at the possibility of free to air broadcasters who acquire the free to air rights to events on the list but choose not to telecast them in full being obligated to offer those unused rights to other free to air broadcasters.</PARA>

We see a series of crocodile tears and belated interest in these matters from him when we see that the syphoning rules, as they are applied, do not give to the Australian public the opportunity to see on free to air television the direct telecast of the Ashes series.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  speaks for itself. This government embarked with the Queensland government and elements of the previous government on a review, which took place initially under the chairmanship of Sir Eric Neal, that involved federal and state personnel. It met with the sugar industry and investigated a raft of aspects relating to sugar industry public policy, both state and federal. Subsequently, Sir Eric Neal resigned to become governor of South Australia and Mr Bruce Vaughan, chairman of MIM and other companies, took over the review. That review eventually reported. To some extent it took over the future direction of the industry. What happened then? The report was backed by the industry and by the Canegrowers Association at office bearer level&mdash;and I accept that there is an ongoing debate at other levels&mdash;and was adopted by the Queensland government.

Can I say at the outset that the current telecommunications national code contains provisions which impose much tighter obligations on telecommunications carriers when undertaking activities such as erecting mobile phone towers and rolling out aerial broadband cable.

We understand that these issues that he has raised are being investigated by Austel. There is a dispute as to whether there has been a formal breach of the code. I understand that Austel is establishing the facts of this matter but has not yet made a finding.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5367">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There would seem to be some important principles in considering this issue which include ensuring the rights of residents under the telecommunications national code are maintained and should a breach be found these rights should be restored so that residents are not disadvantaged, and that penalties for breaches should be in proportion to the seriousness of the breach. Therefore, where severe breaches of the code occur we would expect Austel to take appropriate action. It is the government's view that, given there are potentially serious breaches and, as I prefaced my remarks by saying, they are still under investigation, Austel will deal with these matters expeditiously and make its findings known to parties as soon as possible.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">The reason that I am moving this suspension of standing orders is that this decision to cut the sugar tariff takes effect in two weeks time. The proposal was introduced into the parliament in March this year. Since then, every attempt by the opposition to have this measure debated in the parliament has been blocked. It is a substantial tariff measure which affects the livelihoods of a substantial number of people. There is $27 million to the sugar industry at stake. There are hundreds of jobs at stake. Yet in this parliament we are having to suspend standing orders in order to try to even get a debate on the subject. It invites the question: why won't you allow the debate? We tried earlier to have the debate and you would not allow it. Why won't you allow us to have this debate?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We very clearly have got members of the government on the public record opposing this measure. They too are being stifled in their criticism.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has gone to the cricket.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, as you have correctly ruled, there is no point of order. I am sticking very tightly to the issue of debating why there should be a suspension of standing orders, which the Leader of the House has just said he is going to knock off when we come to have the debate. He is not prepared to have the debate. That invites the question: why won't he have the debate? They are concerned about what is going to come out in the debate. Not only are members of the opposition wanting to put forward the voice of the sugar industry, but also members of his own government are being stifled in their debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I made the point that this is coming apart for them. The deputy manager of the Australian Cane Farmers Association has publicly stated in an article last week that they are feeling betrayed, that they have been enormously let down. In the same article he goes on to say that there is a complete lack of support for people on the land, that they are turning the bush into a series of ghost towns. That is why those opposite do not want a debate. They do not want a debate because they know that this is going to come out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) on the radio last week saying that they should be grateful that the government is gifting them this provision of a single desk in returning for copping a $27 million pay cut in the industry and the loss of hundreds of jobs. When asked on radio about why they have gone back on the election promise, why they have shifted their position, his answer was, `Oh well, we did not expect the industry to come forward and ask for this.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is why we need to suspend the standing orders and have this debate. In two weeks time, this measure to cut $30 million out of the pay packets of people in the sugar industry in North Queensland, Far North Queensland and northern New South Wales comes into effect. It has been in the parliament now for three months, and the government has not been prepared to allow the debate.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5370">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Leader of the House (Mr Reith) has already made it clear again today that he is not going to allow the debate to take place. He has got members of the government splitting all over the place&mdash;on the John Laws program and in the papers&mdash;saying that they, too, are opposed to the measure, but they are not going to be allowed to have their voices heard in this parliament. They are going to have to stand up and vote for their constituents. They are going to have to show us whether they are Canberra's voice up there, or their people's voices down here. I know what that answer will be when it comes to the crunch.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is outrageous; the sugar tariff is an important measure. The Acting Prime Minister showed during question time that their commitments prior to the election were very clear and very specific. Remember those words, `no ifs, no buts.'</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">You are now saying, `No ifs, no buts; I didn't understand what I was talking about. But now that I'm in government, all of a sudden I'm ratting on them.' All of a sudden he has gone out there and told them that they can have a single desk, but they have to forgo the tariffs. He never once made it clear that, under the obligations signed at international level by the previous Labor government, they can have both: they can have both the single desk and the tariff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There you were, Mr Acting Prime Minister, in the parliament, saying, `No ifs, no buts. If Labor introduces a zero tariff, we're going to relegislate.'

The fact of the matter is that they have come down from 57 per cent some years ago to 22&half; per cent today, and are on the way to 15 per cent by the year 2000 and 10 per cent by the year 2005. That is a 60 per cent reduction from where we are at the moment and it is imposing very real reform pressure on an industry that, quite frankly, needed it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point about that is, of course, that the ultimate opportunist in this place, the member for Hotham (Mr Crean), recognised the falsity of those who argued in previous times that tariffs performed a useful economic function, that they preserved jobs, and that they were things that ought to be kept in place in the interests of the union movement. The member for Hotham, in a speech at the National Press Club on 14 August 1991, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The trade union movement, I must say, took a long time to come to grips with this question, because they saw protection, tariff walls, as somehow protecting jobs, but all it did was to weaken the manufacturing capacity of the country . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">On 28 February 1991, on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The World Today</EMPHASIS>  he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . all that tariffs did was to make us look inward. All that tariffs did was to protect local production.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">On <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS>  on 4 February 1992 he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, I am not a believer in the level playing field, but I am also a believer in the fact that part of the reason that we have got into the industrial mess we have is because we relied too heavily on tariff protection in the past.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I believe that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) is essentially a decent man. He is essentially a man who thinks that policy 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5371"> matters and some degree of integrity in public life are things that ought to be aspired to and are worthy of aspiring to. It really must disappoint him to see that all of those who have a commitment to playing a game straight, to solid policy formation, are now condemning him outright.

<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Deputy Speaker, that is quite right. As the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>  observed not long before that, in relation to the tariffs on sugar issue, the fact of the matter is that the decision is exactly, as the editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>  said, what the federal Labor Party would now be proposing if it were still in government. It is quite obvious that the opposition are prepared to jettison every policy principle that they were prepared to fight for in government.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe), who apparently thinks that he can stand up with some credibility in this place and espouse policies that are radically different from everything that they did in government, and wear some credibility for it, really needs to recognise that he is alone. He has a backbench empty of people from regional Australia. Why? Because of the damage their policy approaches, and their refusal to embrace the sorts of reforms that really would have made a difference, did to rural Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point that has to be made on sugar tariffs is that it was one of 74 recommendations that arose out of the review committee that was put together in response to the need for competition review for that industry, whilst, incidentally, the previous government was in power in this town. The recom 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> mendations went first to the Queensland government. We had committed ourselves in principle and in writing in the last election campaign to respect the right of the Queensland government to run that competition review and then to act on its recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What came out of that was a recommendation that the acquisition powers of the Queensland Sugar Corporation ought to be left in place because they were worth a very considerable amount of money to the industry. A figure was put on it; it was many times, as I recall, the value of that attributed to the tariff&mdash;when the tariff is having an impact. Note those words, `When the tariff is having an impact.' That was seen by the sugar industry review team as well as by the industry itself as far and away the most desirable thing for the sugar industry to maintain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On that basis the recommendations taken forward were acted upon by the Borbidge government in Queensland. In conjunction with industry leadership and the review team they then approached us towards the end of last year seeking approval for the one aspect of the recommendations which went to our jurisdiction: the tariff proposal. At their request we made the changes that are now before us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It ought to be acknowledged that many times over the last 15 years the domestic price of sugar has been below the going world rate. That has been the case now since about 1995 and is not disputed by the industry. That brings me to the next question which needs to be asked. Those heroes purporting in this place, belatedly now, to be interested in so&hyphen;called `industry policy'&mdash;they are on what they think is a political winner here&mdash;ought to ask themselves, `Is the industry leadership involved here thanking you for this?' Does the Queensland sugar industry thank you for this? They do not. They do not thank you at all. They made a statement the other day saying, in effect, that they want you to get on with the job. They want to turn their minds to much more important aspects for their industry's future.</PARA>

He has the capacity to inspire a group of people with a vision and then get them to work towards it&mdash;a concept that people on the opposite front bench have obviously lost any understanding of and commitment to in their current desire to say and do anything that they think might shore up a bit of opportunistic and short&hyphen;term gain for them. Let me clearly establish that the industry leadership would not in any way be thanking those opposite for the opportunistic raking over of the matters arising out of this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In any instance of leadership the question at heart has to be: does that leadership have the capacity to determine what is in the best interests of the industry? The sugar industry is making it plain that it is in the interests of the sugar industry at the moment to look forwards rather than backwards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next point is that farm leadership of this nation has for many years fought for lower tariffs, for tariff reform. It needs to be remembered that in 1984 tariffs were estimated to be costing the average broadacre farmer in this country in the order of $12,000 to $13,000 in increased operating costs. That is why, for a long time, groups such as the NFF have pursued lower tariffs and tariff reform. Today the costs of tariffs to the average Australian broadacre business are down to somewhere between $2,000 and $3,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is room for further improvement and further reform, which is precisely what this government has committed itself to with the car plan. The fact is that you are still looking at a 60 per cent reduction between now and the year 2005. That is very real reform by anybody's standards. It is undoubtedly true that rural industries have been asked, particularly during the previous regime, to wear some reform pressure.

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5373"> single desk or you can have tariffs.' Labor says, `Why can't they have both?' Labor in office gave both. In 1993 Labor retained the single desk and it put a freeze on the tariff but we bargained, in return for that freeze on tariff, for the opening up of the land. We argued for more cane to be planted thereby expanding the production. By far the greatest growth in production and exports has occurred in the last three years when we had both a tariff freeze and a single desk, but it is only Labor that is committed to both.

This was a man who had the tables turned upon him, but he has made the National Party and the rural sector the sacrificial lamb. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) guaranteed in the party room that the car tariffs would go down&mdash;this was to appease the National Party&mdash;and then he ratted on them. The Leader of the National Party of Australia, the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer), backed him. You have got to ask yourself, `Why did the Leader of the National Party back him?' I will tell you why: because he has got a car plant in his electorate and he has not got a cane farm.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a leader of a National Party that froze tariffs on cars but will not freeze them on sugar. Why? Because he has got a car plant and not a cane farm.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise a matter that I raised on a previous occasion when matters were referred to the Main Committee. The report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology on fair trading has received a lot of attention over the last few weeks. As I have said earlier, unfortunately, when the report was presented only about 15 or 16 minutes were allowed for the presentation&mdash;and I am not quibbling about that, because I understand that the Selection Committee has a difficult task in apportioning the time. But there is considerable interest not only amongst the committee but amongst other members, and I believe that, to assist whichever minister it may be who is preparing the response to the committee's report, there should be a full discussion of the committee's report.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are also things that we are trying to encourage the government to take to COAG meetings about retail tenancy, and these are things on which the debate is going on outside by the public.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the debate was interrupted last night, I think a number of speakers were making general comments about the amendments in detail, in particular the clause that is before the House at the moment. As the officials come into the House, I will be mainly speaking on amendments Nos 3 and 21 in addition to the clause that is immediately before the chair. Last night we were talking in general terms about the impact of the amendments in detail. In particular these amendments increase the threshold of expenditure on medical expenses 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> before people begin to be eligible for the 20c in the dollar tax rebate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason why I have raised this particular issue so early is that I think there could be a mistake in the supplementary explanatory memorandum. If I am right, it is a very simple one. On page 29, the last paragraph refers to amendment 20, which I assume is really a reference to amendment 21, because I think that is the one that refers to these particular changes. For the record, I would make the point that, if the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) could clarify that, it would certainly be helpful. We understand the government's intention is, through these amendments, to clarify the legality of the changes that the government has been seeking to make for some time now.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I am fully aware of that. We are dealing with government amendments 4 and 5 in schedule 1.</PARA></TALK.START>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MG4">Mr LEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to amendments 4 and 5, can I make the point that this legislation is the third attempt that the government is making to increase the threshold of the medical expenses rebate. The opposition continues to be strongly opposed to this change. The fact that the government has had to have three attempts to implement this decision, which was announced on budget night in August last year, goes to make the  point that not only does the government have 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5378"> troubles in the Senate&mdash;which was the reason for the first failure&mdash;but the government has clearly been unable to ensure that the amendments that it implemented on the last occasion were successful.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having made a mistake myself in recent times in drafting amendments, I can understand that sometimes people are human and make mistakes, but you would expect that the government and the departments and all the thousands of people who work for Attorney-General's, the Department of Health and Family Services, the tax office and Treasury would be more thorough&mdash;given their unlimited resources&mdash;than a shadow minister's office which tries to cobble together some changes with the help and wisdom of the parliamentary staff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The simple point I am trying to make is that in the past the opposition has said that it is unfair to increase this threshold. At the moment it is $1,000. The budget change announced last August was to raise that to $1,500. The compromise the government struck with Senator Harradine was $1,250. These amendments seek to implement that compromise which was reached with Senator Harradine. Given the fact that the opposition still believes that people who do spend more than $1,000 on medical expenses should continue to be entitled to that 20c in the dollar rebate as soon as they exceed $1,000, we will be seeking to oppose amendments 3 and 21.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the record, the sorts of Australians who are caught by this change are people who are required to spend a lot of money on essential medication, people who might be admitted to a private hospital and meet that cost out of their own pocket if they are not privately insured, people who need to purchase incontinence aids or other aged care products that the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) has mentioned on many occasions. He said that those people pay too much money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We find it very strange that, if the minister is sympathetic to those people and their families, why is the government reducing the tax rebate that they have been entitled to in the past? Why is the government not prepared 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to ensure that people continue to be allowed this very modest and sensible rebate? They are the reasons why the opposition will oppose clauses 3 and 21.</PARA></SPEECH>

The Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) in closing the second reading debate last night made the following comments, which will be an introduction to the comments I make in respect of my various amendments:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This issue was dealt with comprehensively in the Senate in December last year when we proposed a transitional deadline of 31 December 1996. The retrospectivity line was run comprehensively by members of the opposition. We did not accept it then and we do not accept now that that is true. This ploy by the opposition is a waste of the parliament's time and a re-run of a political ploy used by the Labor Party to try to buy votes in the Western Australian elections last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The arguments about retrospectivity which the member for Perth based his amendments on were comprehensively responded to in the last round&mdash; pages 28 and 29 of the Senate Economics References Committee report&mdash;and there is nothing further to be added to that. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5379"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There is a lot further to be added and there is a range of questions which arise. I do take issue with the parliamentary secretary saying that this is a ploy to waste the parliament's time. Let us clearly understand how many unsuccessful efforts the government has taken to try to get this measure right. There was an announcement by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) on 20 August 1996 that income derived from the sale of a miner's rights disposed of after 20 August 1996 would be taxable&mdash;effort No. 1.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What happened? In October 1996, the Treasurer came back with mark II, re&hyphen;run No. 2, to have another go to see if the government could get it right the second time, and put in a transitional period to close on 31 December 1996. The bill went to the Senate in the form of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1996. What did the Senate do with that bill? What does the Senate always do? The Senate referred it to a Senate committee. It was referred to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What measure which seized the question of retrospectivity was referred to the Senate committee? The transitional period and the measure which said, `If you sell your miner's right and you derive income between 20 August 1996 and 31 December 1996, then you are tax free. Thereafter, it is taxable.' That is the issue which seized the committee. It is not the case, as the parliamentary secretary has said, that this matter was comprehensively dealt with, or responded to, by that particular committee's report. I will come back to that report shortly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have gone through two of the goes: the budget night release and the October release by the Treasurer which saw Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1996. On that bill the government agreed to a Democrat amendment&mdash;it was proposed by Senator Murray in the Senate&mdash;and that saw the act in its current form. What occurred then? The government discovered that, as a result of its drafting on the night and on the floor of the Senate, it got it wrong&mdash;botch job No. 3.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The parliamentary secretary had the gall last night to say to me&mdash;and, no doubt, by impli 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cation, to the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher)&mdash;that this debate is a ploy to waste the parliament's time. You have had three goes and you still have not got it right. And what you are now proposing with this bill is also wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What do we also discover? We discover, on the basis of amendments that churn off the word processor at 11.19 a.m. on Friday, 13 June 1997, that you could not get Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1997 right either. So do not stand in this place and say that this is a ploy and an opposition re&hyphen;run. You have botched it on four separate occasions and you still have not got it right. That is the first point I take up in terms of a re&hyphen;run and a waste of the parliament's time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The parliamentary secretary last night also commented that `this was a political ploy by the Labor Party to try to buy votes in the Western Australian elections last year', presumably, on some misguided indication that this was a measure which only affected the minerals industry in Western Australia. I understand that the parliamentary secretary comes from Tasmania. I also hope that he understands that this is a measure that deals with more than gold; this deals with a range of mineral commodities&mdash;about 35 or 36 in number. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What do we know about the Tasmanian minerals industry? We know that, in the mid-1990s, Tasmania has a small but rich history in mineral commodities exploration and mining and minerals metallurgical processing. In fact, in the mid-1990s the combined value of the Tasmanian industry by way of production&mdash;minerals exploration, minerals production and metallurgy production&mdash;was over $1 billion. The parliamentary secretary ought to know&mdash;because when I look at the map I think it is close to his electorate&mdash;that the west coast of Tasmania has a rich history in these matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me remind the parliamentary secretary of the range of mineral commodities which have been found in Tasmania, which have all been explored in Tasmania, which have all been dug up in Tasmania, which have vari ously been processed in Tasmania and which have variously been the subject of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5380"> metallurgical processing in some manner or form at some stage of Tasmania's history since 1880.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What are the mineral commodities in Tasmania that are affected by this provision? Antimony, chromite, cobalt, copper, gold, ilmenite, manganese, mercury, molybdenum, monazite, nickel, osmiridium, pyrite, rutile, tin, tungsten, zircon and graphite. So let us not have the parliamentary secretary come into this place and say that this is a ploy that relates to a Western Australian measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope that the parliamentary secretary has also read the constitution. We cannot apply acts from this parliament which disadvantage particular states or advantage others. This applies generally. The parliamentary secretary nods and says that that is true. Frankly, I would have thought that, given that I had given the parliamentary secretary the courtesy of slipping the odd amendment to him, he might have, firstly, not said what he said last night and, secondly, had the courtesy of perhaps drawing attention to the government's amendments a little bit earlier than they were dropped on the shadow Treasurer's desk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me now come to the substance of the response that the parliamentary secretary made last night. I ran the argument that the question was one of retrospectivity. He said that the question was not one of retrospectivity. I say of retrospectivity and unfairness&mdash;retrospectivity and unfairness because of the five&hyphen;year regime which the government has put before the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did the Senate Economics Legislation Committee in its report on pages 28 and 29&mdash;the very pages to which the parliamentary secretary referred last night&mdash;have to say about this issue? There was one majority report compiled by the government members. There also were two minority reports: one by Labor senators Sherry and Cook; and one by Democrat Senator Murray. On page 29 the majority report, when referring to transitional provisions&mdash;and note here that we are talking about a transitional provision up to 31 December 1996&mdash;had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Transitional provisions</EMPHASIS> 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee is satisfied that these provisions are not retrospective in the ordinary legal sense which is of concern to the Senate, where retrospectivity is defined thus:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">`Legislation is retrospective if it provides that at a past date the law is to be taken to have been what it was not at that date.'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These provisions are clearly not in that category. The witnesses' complaint, though, was that the change is unfairly retrospective `in effect', for the reasons mentioned on page 27 above. This is the real issue.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In other words, are they unfairly retrospective `in effect'? Further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Judging this matter depends on one's point of view. The government speaks of a prospector's post&hyphen;31 December 1996 sale of rights as `income yet to be earned'; the industry sees it as `the realisation' of income that has `accrued' over a period. The government's view in effect postulates that prospectors are, in principle, like any other trading business: their business, over time, is buying and selling things for profit having added value by their exertions in the interim.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By this logic, their transactions that take place after a change in tax law cannot expect to be quarantined from the change simply because they have a history.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It then goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The problem for the prospectors arises because of the `lumpiness' of their business, in which one sale may be the fruit of many years work. Hence their preferred analogies with the 1986 capital gains tax grandfather provisions, and with the transitional provisions of the present bill on tax exempt entities that become taxable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both views are intuitively plausible. On balance the Committee accepts the government's view.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So, unlike what the parliamentary secretary had to say to the House last night, namely, that this issue before us was comprehensively dealt with by the Senate committee, the Senate committee did not deal with the provisions that we are dealing with. Secondly, on the question of retrospectivity, the government members themselves said that it was a question of whether it was unfairly retrospective in effect; that that was the real issue; that that depended on one's point of view; and that both views&mdash;that is, that it was unfair or that it was not&mdash;were intuitively plausible. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS>  The committee  went on to say, `On balance, the committee accepts the government's view.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That `on balance' view was not accepted by senators Cook and Sherry, and neither was it 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5381"> accepted by Senator Murray. Senator Murray, in his minority report under transitional provisions, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Income affected by 23(pa) has variously been described as deferred, undistributed, assessed, or accrued. The main focus of witnesses and submissions has been on the unfair and retrospective nature of this tax concession change.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Prospectors affected by this tax change have spent a number of years at considerable cost in the legitimate and legal expectation of benefiting from 23(pa), and realising those benefits some years hence. Although the income affected is not determined and finitely quantifiable until the sale of rights is achieved, this is not income yet to be earned. The detrimental effects of this change will be felt by prospectors at some time in the future, when they will incur a retrospective tax on income deferred but earned years ago.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Senator Murray went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One solution suggested has been a `grandfather' clause exempting eligible prospectors whose eligible activities in terms of 23(pa) were under way prior to 20 August 1996. The Australian Democrats think that is unnecessary, since witnesses indicated that five years would be sufficient for nearly all such activities in train prior to 20 August 1996, to be sold or resolved. For instance the West Australia Mines Department has judged that a license holder requires a maximum five years to identify the extent and commercial value of an Exploration Licence.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Senator Murray formally recommended in respect of prospectors and schemes in train and eligible prior to 20 August 1996:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we propose extending the applicability of 23(pa) until 20 August 2001.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is where the five years came from. The five years came from a minority report from Senator Murray. Senators Cook and Sherry recommended an entire grandfathering, which is reflected by my amendment No. 1.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what do we find if we take the weight of the committee report? Firstly, it did not deal comprehensively with the question or the regime that the parliamentary secretary puts before us today. Secondly, the government members themselves said what is unfair retrospectively, in effect. Thirdly, we find that Senator Murray recommends a five-year transitional arrangement. But his recommendation is not reflected by the amendment which comes out of the No. 3 1996 bill. That is technically deficient. That is another little 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> botch-up, and the government has come back in the 1997 bill to fix up that technical deficiency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the regime that the government's measure seeks to put in place? Yes, it is a five-year grandfathering. Therefore, if you are a bona fide prospector and you dispose of your right to mine and you derive income between 20 August 1996 and 20 August 2001, provided you satisfy other conditions, you are tax exempt. The income you derive from that sale is tax exempt, just as it has been for many years in this industry's history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what were the provisions or requirements that were interposed, that we did not see in Senator Murray's recommendation, that we saw bubble up on the floor of the Senate? Firstly, we saw a requirement that the rights to mine were acquired by a person before 7.30 p.m. on 20 August 1996. There is no problem there. That is budget night. The income is derived before 20 August 2001. That is the five-year model. There is no difficulty there. Then there is a requirement that the person on or before 20 August 1996 and at the time the income was derived is a bona fide prospector. So we see the interposition here of a new element: that, at the time the income is derived, the person is a bona fide prospector. You need to be a bona fide prospector not just on budget night of 1996 but also when you derive the income, provided the derivation of that income is no later than 20 August 2001.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a further new element. The further new element which is interposed is that only a certain amount of the income that you derive will be tax exempt. The tax exemption only applies to so much of the income derived as would have been derived if those rights had been sold for their market value `at that time'. What is `at that time'? Budget night, 20 August 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the regime that the parliamentary secretary and the government have put before  us? They put before us a regime with a five-year grandfathering provision, a requirement that you be a bona fide prospector at the time you derive the income and a requirement that the only income tax&hyphen;exempt is income to a measure or to a level of what the value would 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5382"> have been if those rights had been sold for the market value on budget night 1996. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> I thank my colleague the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), who is listening patiently.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This regime is not one which was comprehensively and exhaustively assessed by the Senate committee. By the standards put out by the majority Senate committee report, let alone Senators Murray or Cook or Sherry, there are a range of deficiencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is now required of prospectors? Firstly, you have to show that you were a bona fide prospector on 20 August 1996. No drama there. Then you have to show that you derived the income on or before 20 August 2001. That is the five&hyphen;year grandfathering period. There is probably a technical deficiency here which the parliamentary secretary might want to bear in mind. I put it on the record for subsequent consideration. There are a range of contracts for the sale of a miner's rights where the income is derived a considerable period after the contract.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By the time we rattle off to the year 2000 and get close to 30 December 2001, we might find there are a significant number of contracts which are settled but where the income is not derived until after 2001. The parliamentary secretary might want to have a look at that at some subsequent stage, because I am not necessarily confident of the devotion we will get to these technical points or issues today. You might want to look at the contrast between deriving the income and concluding a legally enforceable contract.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I digress ever so slightly. What is the regime? You prove that you are a bona fide prospector, you prove you derive the income, you also have to prove that you are a bona fide prospector at the time you derive the income. I will repeat the example that I gave last night. You are a bona fide prospector on budget night 1996. You go out the next day looking for gold in the Yilgarn or in the parliamentary secretary's electorate looking for any number of those various minerals which have been discovered, mined and processed at some time in Tasmania's history&mdash;and you find one of them.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You say, `I am proposing to dispose of my miner's rights here.' When you go back to Launceston or Burnie you have a serious car accident and you go from being a bona fide prospector to an invalid pensioner. The income that you derive from the sale of your miner's right will not be tax exempt. It will not be tax exempt because you are no longer a bona fide prospector at the time you derive the income. That is unfair. It is harsh and unfair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What other aspects of this regime are in effect unfair and which render their retrospectivity unfair and harsh? The regime requires that the only exempt income is income up to the market value of the miner's right as at budget night 1996. So you are in the next century. You are in the year 2000, and you enter into a contract to sell your miner's right. Under this regime, what will be the exempt income? The exempt income will be income that you derive from the contract that you conclude in the year 2000 to the value that the taxation commissioner judges was the market value of your miner's right on 20 August 1996!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are a prospector, what do you have to do? The first thing you have to do, if you have not done so already, is go out and acquire yourself a valuation at your own cost. What do we know about valuations? We know that valuations vary notoriously and are expensive: especially in this area of exploration and prospectivity will they vary notoriously. If you want some valuation of your miner's right, you have to go out and get a valuation. You know that is at your own cost but you also know that the tax commissioner can, at any point in the cycle, go behind it and ignore it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the authority for that? If you look at a couple of rudimentary rulings by the taxation commissioner, it is quite clearly the case that the Australian Taxation Office already proceeds on the basis that valuations in any area can be highly subjective. Even if  you go out at your own cost and get an independent valuation, that will not be immune from challenge. You cannot lock in a value up&hyphen;front. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> The commissioner can go behind it&mdash;two 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5383"> years later, three years later, four years later or five years later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What do we know about how those valuations might be treated? In the Senate, Senator Murray asked the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp, a question on this matter. Senator Kemp answered as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) has stated in Taxation Determination TD 11&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I actually think it was TD 10&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that where the market value of an asset needs to be determined, taxpayers can choose to either obtain a detailed valuation from a qualified valuer, or compute their own valuation based on reasonably objective and supportable data. The ATO has also stated that it may challenge valuations where appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The question then goes through to summarise a public ruling, IT2378, which I have here in full but I will not read it all in. Paragraph 12 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Determinations of the value of a prospecting or mining right may be required for various purposes. In some instances such valuations are required to be supported by an expert's report. At the grassroots or wild cat exploration stage it is accepted, for those purposes, that such values are highly subjective as well as being heavily discounted for the risk factors involved.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Paragraph 13 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any such valuations may give some assistance in determining the market value of the prospecting or mining right for income tax and capital gains purposes. Market value is not defined in the act, but guidance as to its meaning may be drawn from principles enunciated in Spencer v. the Commonwealth 1907, Mr Justice Isaacs.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The notion of willing seller and willing buyer, even though you are not necessarily enthusiastic, are repeated there as they were in a judgment from Lord Denning, Master of the Rolls, in a United Kingdom case in 1965.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where does all this lead? All this leads to a regime the practical effect of which is an unfair and a retrospective application of a tax. Far from the Senate committee having given this the green light, the Senate committee did not even consider it. When you apply the model proposed by the Senate committee it is clear that this five&hyphen;year model, with the various conditions I have outlined, fails even the test of the government's own senators. For those reasons, I propose that the bill be amended to effect an entire grandfathering of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> these provisions. That is reflected in amendment No. 1.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a few comments about the first amendment proposed by the opposition spokesman, the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith). The government opposes this amendment because it grandfathers the exemption indefinitely to those rights which were acquired before the government's 1996 budget night announcement. This is inconsistent with other prospective tax changes to the treatment of income which should impact on income yet to be earned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not a government botch&hyphen;up as indicated by the opposition spokesman. The government made its announcement in the 1996 budget. Then in October 1996, the government announced, after listening to the concerns of affected taxpayers, that in order to ensure transitional provisions fair to prospectors who were in the process of selling permits when the budget announcement was made the government decided that the measures will not apply to sales, transfers or assignments for contracts entered into up until midnight on 31 December 1996. We have been listening to the prospectors in the mining industry who are involved. Quite contrary to what was implied, that is, that we had not been listening and were not concerned about the industry, I point out that we certainly have been out there listening. The member also indicated that this is a new imposition. That is not the case. The fact is that this has been a requirement since 1977. Therefore, it has been in for quite a long time&mdash;20 years, in fact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to turn to a couple of comments about the possibility of a prospector who might be in a car accident or something like that. The member for Perth has this entirely wrong. The member for Perth asserted that a  person who became an invalid shortly after the 20 August 1996 announcement cannot be a bona fide prospector for paragraph 23(pa) purposes. The requirement for being regarded as a bona fide prospector is that a person has personally carried out the whole or the major part of the field work. A person would remain 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5384"> a bona fide prospector in respect of a particular area until another person, the purchaser, acquires the area and carries out the major part of the field work. We do not accept at all the proposition put up by the member for Perth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Perth, in moving his amendment, appears to have disregarded the amendments agreed to by the parliament in December 1996. These amendments have already been agreed to by the parliament, but the member has continued to debate a whole range of issues. The amendments contained in the bill are simply overcoming the technical deficiencies in the December 1996 amendments. These amendments are considerably more generous than those introduced by the government following the August 1996 budget announcement.

<PARA STYLE="Para">The second amendment circulated in my name was an alternative if the first amendment was defeated. It puts in place a five-year grandfather provision but with none of the requirements that we find introduced in the government's amendment. The parliamentary secretary asserted that these are technically tidying up something that the parliament has agreed to. It is the case that in the Senate Senator Cook, when debating the 1996 No. 3 bill, moved an amendment to grandfather these provisions entirely which was defeated. That was consistent with the minority report that he tabled together with Senator Sherry. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> There has been consistency, so far as our position is concerned, on an entire grandfathering. It was in Senator Cook and Senator Sherry's minority report. He moved an amendment to that effect in the Senate. When that was defeated, Senator Murray's amendment was agreed to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The starting position for Senator Cook and for the opposition was an entire grandfathering. Because it has taken three attempts to get this right, I am giving a bit of a helping hand. Having pursued consistently the entire grandfathering, I now pursue a five&hyphen;year grandfathering. What are the defects with the five&hyphen;year grandfathering? The defects are that you have to be a bona fide prospector at the time you derive the income. I gave what I regard to be the harshest example and the parliamentary secretary said, `We don't agree with that,' and referred to the definition in the act and industry practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the industry practice? The industry practice is often like this: a small leaseholder, prospector, individual operator or small partnership explores successfully and finds something: it may be worth going on with. He has neither the expertise nor the capital cost to drill. He goes along to an exploration company and says, `I think I've found something. We have a good working relationship. Why don't you have a further go and if there is something there I will sell it to you.' So the company goes out and pursues further exploration. They discover they are on to something, so a contract is concluded for the sale of miner's rights. In the meantime a different company, an exploration company with greater expertise or capital access, has worked the lease, has worked the field. Under the government's definition, that prospector who sells his miner's right would not be a bona fide prospector at the time the income is derived and therefore the income derived from that would not be tax exempt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not my obscurantist example; that is industry practice and the parliamentary secretary well knows it if he has been to Western Australia or Tasmania and spoken to people who explore at this level. This is about small prospectors kicking over rocks. When they get 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5385"> on to something they might occasionally work it themselves but more often than not the usual industry practice is that they hand over to someone else who works it and when that work is fruitful then a contract is concluded. That reflects the industry practice. Your amendment does not reflect industry practice. Your bill does not reflect the industry practice and it will unfairly deprive prospectors of the exemption that your regime postulates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you ignore my harsh example and use industry practice, your regime is deficient. The second reason why your regime is deficient is that it is unfair because it effectively requires people to go out and get valuations which the ATO on its own rulings over 10 years ago have already said in any circumstances can be gone behind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How will this work in practice? Say you are on Three Boy Hill in Southern Cross and you have an exploration lease and down the road there is an exploration lease that has been sold by way of a miner's right and it goes for, say, $50,000. You value that on budget night on 20 August 1996 and you might say that the one down the road was $50,000 and this one is $50,000 as well. You then discover gold. What happens? The valuation immediately increases. So the whole nature of prospectivity, the whole nature of incentive for prospecting, which keeps the bottom end of the gold and other metal industries operating comes into play. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The valuation will increase immediately. So the very nature of prospectivity and exploration is based on hard toil and the prospect of at some stage getting a return. As government members in the Senate report put it, it is a lumpy business&mdash;you accrue income at a particular point in time after years of effort. Then under your regime you punish people for the very nature of prospectivity. That leaves aside the notion that valuations in a speculative area are going to differ wildly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen in some recent floats in corporations, for example, where some independent valuers have valued Optus Vision shares at $3 and others have valued them at 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> $1.6 billion. It is a bit like the former shadow spokesman for health, the former member for Tangney, Mr Shack, with his notorious statement `somewhere between zero and $2.6 billion'. These valuations are notoriously speculative and will differ.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You put the prospector under the burden of getting a valuation which you know the tax commissioner will go behind and which you know, because commonsense tells you it is the case, that if he actually gets on to something he will be punished because the value of the miner's right will have acquired a far greater value because of the success of the exploration. So the regime which you have put in place is unfair and it fails the test which the government members in the Senate set out, which is: does it, in effect, operate unfairly?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate committee did not look at this point. We are looking at it now in very many respects for the first time in the clear light of day because the basis of this regime was effectively cobbled on the floor of the Senate. If you apply that test, it is unfair. It has an unfair retrospective effect and it places the prospector under, effectively, an unconscionable burden. For those reasons, I have moved amendment No. 2.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wonder whether the parliamentary secretary might tease us along a little bit and advise the House, firstly, how he thinks requiring a prospector to go out and get a valuation of a miner's right as at 20 August 1996 at his own cost is fair and helpful to  prospectors and prospectivity. Secondly, how is that fair when we know as a matter of course the ATO will look behind that? How is it fair when we know that if the prospector gets on to something and discovers something, the value will increase either markedly

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you want to have a five&hyphen;year tax exempt regime on the basis of it being a reasonable balance between taxing income and recognising industry practice, how is it fair to impose a market valuation as at 20 August 1996 regime? How is it fair to require that you be a bona fide prospector at the time you derived the income? You were happy to respond to my harshest argument, why do you not respond&mdash;you said that you were listening to industry&mdash;to the very example which is the industry practice? Indeed, on 29 April the Association of Mining and Exploration Companies wrote to the Assistant Treasurer, stating:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 23(pa) as it currently stands requires that the taxpayer is a bona fide prospector either on or prior to 20 August 1996 and at the time he derived income from the sale of rights to mine they were a bona fide prospector. AMEC considers that whether a taxpayer is a bona fide prospector or not should be determined at the time of sale, transfer or assignment, not at the time income is derived. It is a rare occurrence for a prospector that income is derived at the time of sale, transfer or assignment. For example, where there is a deferred settlement, income will not be derived by the prospector until settlement and completion of the contract of sale occurs. The longer the period between date of execution and completion of the contract of sale, the greater will be the risk that the prospector cannot satisfy the bona fide prospector test. For example, a prospector may be a bona fide prospector on the date of sale through having carried out the whole or a major part of the field work of prospecting, but may lose that status at the time the income is derived&mdash;say, six months later&mdash;because of the field work carried out by the purchaser in the meantime. In AMEC's view, subparagraph (2) should contain a test which is consistent with the overall objective of section 23(pa), being that the taxpayer was a bona fide prospector at the date of sale, transfer, assignment or tenement.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">If you have been listening to industry concerns, presumably the Assistant Treasurer has considered that representation of AMEC&mdash;one of the most relevant industry organisations&mdash;of the end of April where, to again make the point, the prospector `may lose that status at the time the income is derived&mdash;say, six months later&mdash;because of the field work carried out by the purchaser in the meantime.'

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will reiterate the factors relating to why we are opposing this amendment. All of the amendments which are proposed broaden the phase&hyphen;out of the exemption and go far beyond that which has already been agreed to by the parliament in December last year. To make a comment in response to the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith), a bona fide prospector status at derivation has always been a prerequisite for getting the exemption. The industry practice concerns raised by the member for Perth have always been considerations in applying paragraph 23(pa) to give an exemption.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule 2, page 27 (lines 12 and 13) omit ", and at the time the income was derived,".</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This amendment proposes the deletion of the words `and at the time the income was derived was a bona fide prospector'. The parlia 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> mentary secretary in the debate on the previous amendment asserted the point that being a prospector at the time of deriving the income has always been a requirement of the income tax arrangement. That may well be true but we have never had that arrangement in place at the same time that you have had a five&hyphen;year grandfathering provision in place. What will the effect of the five&hyphen;year grandfathering be?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The effect of the five&hyphen;year grandfathering will be that a number of explorers and prospectors at the bottom end of the market will say, `This has always been a marginal prospect for us; it is no longer worth our while. The game is no longer worth the candle. We will get out of the business; we will sell our current miner's rights and derive income from that.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to the industry practice which I have outlined, you will see as a consequence of this measure a range of prospectors vacating the field. They will vacate the field to pursue some other form of employment or livelihood. The consequence of the requirement that you have both a five-year grandfather provision with a market valuation test at 20 August with a requirement that you be a bona fide prospector at the time you derive the income all lead to an unfair result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Cook made clear in his minority report, as he made clear in the Senate and as I am happy to make clear today, at the end of the day there is no real difficulty with the taxation of this income provided you do not do it in a retrospective way or an unfair way. This regime is unfair because its effect in practice is retrospectively unfair. It places prospectors in an intolerable position by forcing them to go out now and get valuations of their miner's rights as at budget night August 1996, which we know the tax commissioner will go behind. When will the  taxation commissioner go behind them? He will go behind them when he thinks there may have been an income derived which is greater than the valuation and, the final requirement, that you are a bona fide prospector at the time the income is derived.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The parliamentary secretary indicated earlier that the government had been listening to the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5388"> industry&mdash;I referred to a formal representation that had been made by AMEC in July. AMEC have made representations to me, which I am happy to summarise to the House, on this particular point. They say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This sunset clause will have the effect of pushing many prospectors out of the business of prospecting because it may no longer be profitable or worth their while to continue in the business. In this sense once the prospector has sold his final tenement he may then move into other employment and forfeit his  right of bona fide prospector very soon after. This loss of title of bona fide prospector in some cases may occur before the prospector has derived the income from the sale of his mining tenement and therefore he would not be able to claim the income tax exemption.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So the regime which the government proposes to put in place has at every step in the process been unfair in its retrospective effect. The least the government could do is to remove this requirement. When you put to one side the difficulties of the valuation this is, in very many respects, probably the harshest and most unconscionable of all the aspects of the regime.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We also oppose this amendment for the following reasons. Firstly, since the introduction in 1977, paragraph 23(pa) has always required that, to be eligible for the exemption, a person must be a bona fide prospector at the time the income is derived. Secondly, this is a fundamental requirement that ensures that the exemption in relation to the sale of rights in an area is only available to the person who has undertaken the majority of the fieldwork in that area. Thirdly, this requirement also ensures that the tax treatment of income derived in an income year applies to the circumstances in that year. Lastly, to remove this requirement would amount to a change in policy during the phasing&hyphen;out period. This is inappropriate and it is inconsistent.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because there are 15 schedules to the main bill, it was not possible to canvass all the schedules in my speech during the second reading debate. As I mentioned last night, there are a couple of points that I want to raise in connection with both schedules 9 and 10 which I have not had the opportunity to air yet.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">First, I wish to comment on schedule 9. It involves an amendment that would see employers bound to continue making superannuation contributions on behalf of their employee if a bona fide link with the paid work force is maintained by that individual until age 70. It proposes that a worker must be gainfully employed for a minimum of 10 hours per week over the year if they are to continue with their superannuation contributions. It is a proposition that I wholeheartedly support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Participants in the 1996 tax summit were told that, if current trends in birth rates and extended life expectancy continue, `most Australians can expect to spend up to one&hyphen;third of their lives in some form of retirement from full&hyphen;time work'. That would represent a huge drain on future public revenue which is arguably unsustainable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation in schedule 9 also provides some incentive for individuals to postpone  their retirement. It gives those Australians who want to remain productive in the paid work force for longer the opportunity to save more for their retirement, but the effect of the legislation will be undermined by the fact that many Australians can draw on their superannuation fund at the age of 55.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Institute of Family Studies reported in March 1997 that the participation of older men in the paid work force is undergoing a long&hyphen;term decline. The decline is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5390"> apparently most marked amongst men in their late fifties and early sixties. For example, there has been a drop of men aged 55 to 59 in the work force of almost 10 per cent since 1978. If that trend continues, only 66 per cent of men in this age bracket will participate in the paid work force by the year 2011. Obviously this decline was under way long before the former government announced its campaign to lift national savings through compulsory superannuation. However, the trend will continue if the current government fails to act to stop people from accessing their super funds as early as age 55.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The impact of raising the age threshold on superannuation contributions on the federal government's unfunded liability should not be underestimated either. As at March 1996, the public sector held between $80 billion to $100 billion in unfunded liabilities, most of which is a liability on the Commonwealth. On top of that, they have got contingency liabilities on former government trading enterprises and the like that have been privatised. By increasing the age threshold on compulsory employer superannuation contributions, the government will have to fund an even greater debt in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The financial impact statement estimates that the cost to revenue of this measure will amount to around $16 million over the years from 1998 to 2000. That is not an insignificant sum in terms of a cost to the revenue, but it is a cost worth bearing if it is offset by a greater increase in superannuation contributions. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other amendment relating to superannuation in the bill comes in schedule 10. It will allow for a rebate of up to $540 per annum to be paid to any person who contributes to superannuation on behalf of a non&hyphen;working or low income earning spouse. The government is meeting one of its 1996&hyphen;97 budget undertakings. Under present superannuation laws, a fund cannot accept contributions from non&hyphen;working individuals and the laws favour full&hyphen;time and part&hyphen;time employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment should, therefore, be of particular benefit to many women and casual 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ly employed Australians who cannot at present take full advantage of contemporary superannuation arrangements. Given that household savings have actually declined over the past 10 years since the introduction of award superannuation in 1986, the government is to be commended on this attempt to make superannuation more attractive to more people in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rebate of $540 is quite generous and it should provide further incentive to maintain regular superannuation contributions. The explanatory memorandum makes it clear that the working spouse can opt to contribute to a retirement savings account, RSA, on behalf of his or her spouse once the RSAs are operational&mdash;and I guess that depends on our friends in the Senate. This element of the government's approach also represents good policy. What is not stipulated is whether a working spouse will be able to make contributions on behalf of their non&hyphen;working or low income earning partner to their own company or industry fund. Under current legislation, it is prohibited.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is widely accepted that employee and company superannuation funds are amongst the more efficient funds operating in the industry. Unless the government legislates to extend employee based funds to include contributions made on behalf of spouses, the non&hyphen;working spouse will have to establish a private fund. The cost involved with that alternative will render the whole proposal much less attractive and could undermine the effect of this amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government needs to make clear its position on this point, and I would welcome that. If the parliamentary secretary can enlighten me on that last point, I will be very  grateful. In the meantime, I will seek the call to speak on schedule 11 later.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA STYLE="Para">I will run through these amendments fairly quickly. Amendments 7 and 8 are minor corrective measures which ensure that amendments to the income tax research and development provisions made by the Taxation Laws Amendment Act (No. 3) 1996&mdash;and announced on 23 July 1996&mdash;apply as intended. Amendment 9 will provide that the amendments contained in part 1 of schedule 14 of the bill will only apply to the 1996&hyphen;97 year of income. Amendment 10 will insert definitions for the purposes of the special tracing rules. Amendment 11 will provide that the special tracing rules can be used to determine whether the new current year capital loss provisions in the bill will apply to a listed public company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendments 12 and 13 will align the terminology used in the current year capital loss provisions of the bill with that used in the new 1997 Taxation Act. Amendment 14 introduces the new special tracing rules for listed public companies. These new tracing rules will result in a reduction in compliance costs for listed public companies as they streamline the requirements for determining continuity of majority underlying ownership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment 15 will ensure that an explanatory note in the provisions correctly reflects the operation of the provisions. Amendment 16 will omit a definition in the bill which is already found in the new 1997 Taxation Act. Amendment 17 will ensure that provisions dealing with subvention payments operate as intended. Amendment 18 will ensure that the commissioner's power to amend an assessment will apply in a similar manner for current year revenue and capital losses.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment 19 will make several consequential amendments to ensure the provisions of the bill have their intended effect. The amendment will also extend the changes to the revenue loss provisions in the bill to the corresponding provisions in the new 1997 Taxation Act. Amendment 21 will make a minor amendment to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997 to ensure the capital loss transfer provisions apply as intended.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak to government amendments Nos 7 and 8. As the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) has indicated, these amendments concern changes announced to research and development by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in his 1996&hyphen;97 budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have already spoken in some depth about my misgivings of the way in which the government has handled&mdash;or should I say mishandled&mdash;the whole issue of research and development in previous debates, so my comments will be brief.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Section 11 sets out to extend the core technology deduction rules to include companies in a partnership structure. In so doing, it levels the playing field in Australia between companies in partnership and those with alternative business structures. But it should not be forgotten that Australian companies involved in research and development are now trying to compete on very uneven conditions, thanks to decisions taken by this government in its last budget and to sloppy handling of legislation by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind the House of the terrific gamble the coalition took last year when it axed the R&amp;D syndication program and reduced the general R&amp;D concession to 125 per cent. It was a punt taken on the premise of rorting and abuse of the concession, although the government was never able to produce anything which substantiated those claims. The success or failure of the gamble will not be known for years to come.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the whole, I would like to say that careful consideration should be given to these 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5404"> amendments, and I think it will be in the Senate as well as here. The fact that four of the 15 schedules have been referred to Senate committees for review suggests that adequate thought did not go into the drafting of the legislation or, at best, it is suspect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In particular, the government, which continues to champion the cause of small business while doing little of substance to alleviate the compliance burden, must seriously consider reviewing schedule 1 in this legislation. I register my qualified support for the bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too wish to rise in relation to amendments 7 and 8. I spoke in the second reading debate on this bill and indicated the opposition's continuing major concerns about what this government has done to the research and development effort of this country. The cuts to the 150 per cent and the ending of syndication have seen a massive falling away in expenditure on research and development in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very interesting that the amendments we are now dealing with are government amendments. So what they are doing is amending what they sought to get through before. There are a number of examples where we want to draw attention to this. The minister refers to them as minor corrections. For example, the feedstock provisions, which are items 1A, 1B, 1C and 1H of amendment 7, recognise that sometimes feedstock can be transformed into a valuable product at the end of an R&amp;D process rather than being consumed in that process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Accordingly, the research and development provisions grant only the concessional 125 per cent deduction for the amount of feedstock consumed or used up in the R&amp;D process with normal provisions applying, that is, the 100 per cent deductibility to feedstock that is transformed into a valuable product. This seems to us to be on the face of it a reasonable system, because you get the benefit of a traded good at the end of the transformed process which can become a deduction as an input into the process of production.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the government, in dealing with this problem, botched the implementation of the legislation, because it rushed it through last year, by not adequately covering situations where there is more than one R&amp;D activity being conducted. The amendments seek to fix this up with the explanation in the replacement supplementary explanatory memorandum admitting that the formula `can have the unintended effect of providing deductions (concessional or otherwise) for non&hyphen;existent costs'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here we have a government, therefore, which made bogus claims about rorts as an excuse to limit R&amp;D introducing a rort of their own which they are now having to correct. I agree entirely with the member who just preceded me, the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), that we still have not had an explanation in this House of an actual example of a rort that justified the end to research and development syndication.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) being fed pieces of paper to get up and meet these points, but as late as yesterday he was saying, quite contrary to what I have been saying, `the government is keen to see research and development continue, but I do have to point out that there were many rorts involved, particularly in the syndication area'. Well, tell us where they are, Parliamentary Secretary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a bill that the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) and I attacked you on last year and attacked the Treasurer (Mr Costello) on&mdash;had him sitting in this chamber at that chair signing Christmas cards because he was so embarrassed&mdash;and we were saying, `Just give us an example. One example of a rort will do and we might consider it.' He could not produce one.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly. Silence of the dogs. And that press release that was put out that had the so&hyphen;called four actual examples? Not one of them was actual; they were all concocted&mdash;the Wright family into syndication. Your excuse for ending it was that you said you had a rort.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It appears as though the replacement supplementary explanatory memorandum is in error as it talks about the formula used and examples in Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1997. The issue of feedstock is not dealt with in this bill except in those amendments.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want him to give me an example of the rorts, Mr Deputy Speaker. If he is rising to do that, I invite him to do so. I would welcome that. I would be prepared to cede the point to him, but let him tell us where the rorts exist.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Anyway, I go back to the issue of core technology, because this was a huge mistake in the sloppy draftsmanship and the hurried way in which they brought the issue before the parliament last year. The bill itself is already correcting the anomaly between partnerships and separate companies concerning core technology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not believe that syndication should have been ended. We do not believe that the baby should have been thrown out with the bathwater. We were in favour of tightening up 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the provisions but not ending the scheme, but nevertheless the government has chosen to end it and in the process created this anomaly between partnerships and separate companies, with partnerships still able to claim for core technology&mdash;the whole 100 per cent in terms of core technology, as I understand it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We now have this amendment which reveals an incredible additional error in the law and means that currently a deduction is denied for any core technology in the year that it is incurred. The way in which it was drafted means that deductions are allowed only in future years, not in the current year. Clearly this is a huge mistake&mdash;symptomatic of the bad processes which were undertaken last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The further amendment in item 1G replaces an incorrect paragraph reference with the correct one. Of course, we do not oppose this, but we do note that it is a further error.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third area I want to address my remarks to relates to pilot plant, items 1D and 1J of amendment 7. Item 1D is fixing yet another serious error in the R&amp;D provisions concerning depreciation allowable for pilot plant. There is a circular inconsistency in the existing provisions which is described in the government's replacement supplementary explanatory memorandum as a nonsense. That is on page 26.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A further mistake is being corrected by the enactment of item 1J, which provides a balancing adjustment for post-23 July 1996 pilot plant disposed of prior to the completion of the relevant R&amp;D activity. This is further evidence of the mess that the 1996 changes have created. Again, we do not have any option but to support the amendment, as it is fixing up a serious error which should never have been allowed to have been legislated last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I can just say this in conclusion: I reiterate this point. The Labor Party said, `Tighten up the scheme, fix what you claim to be the rorts'&mdash;we still have not seen any evidence of it&mdash;`but don't end the scheme.' What we seem to have achieved is a government that cannot fix it and cannot even end the scheme properly. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5406">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is symptomatic of the inability of this government to come to grips with sound policy prescription. Then when they proceed down this blind course of cutting for the sake of it, addressing the budget bottom line but not the impact on Australia's research and development effort, they muck it up. This is a government that does not deserve to be returned at the next election, and I think this process is but one of the examples as to why people will see the need for a change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope that not too much damage is done in the process, but already the indications are of a massive walking away from research and development in this country, when every other nation in the world is increasing their effort and providing incentives to do so. Our future does depend on innovation and skills, yet the two areas that have been hacked at massively are incentives to research and development and incentives to skill formation. This is a government that has no sense of where it is going and, in the process, the nation is going to suffer greatly.</PARA></SPEECH>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5409"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This higher education legislation is very much an admission of failure, almost another apology from the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone. It is her attempt to place a bandaid on the gaping wound that she has opened up in Australia's higher education sector. But, in every respect, the bandaid is much too small and the wound much too large to have any lasting impact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill must be seen in the light of the budget decisions from both last year and this. Last year's budget produced a funding cut for operating grants to the tune of $624 million, a cut in discretionary funding of $215 million and a further $1.13 billion in savings from changes to HECS. Last year's budget dealt a savage blow to higher education. It was a disturbing comment on the government's priorities that it decided to quarantine funding for defence and yet hold out cuts to education, higher education in particular, as the largest amount of fiscal consolidation on the Howard government agenda. To find in 1997 these minor concessions to that scale of cuts is, indeed, disappointing. I would have thought the government, acting out a sound policy, would have reversed the swingeing cuts to higher education and tried to grow the sector, as indeed most of our economic competitors are trying to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that the government is announcing and trying to implement a so-called restructuring and rationalisation plan to the tune of $26 million is an admission of defeat. What sort of government is it that causes so much crisis and disturbance in higher education in Australia and then, having caused the problem, tries to rectify it with a small amount of $26 million in so-called restructuring and rationalisation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The truth is that the rationalisation funding, which I believe was intended for a four- or five-year period, is probably going to be eaten up in the first year in trying to compensate those universities that have been severely disadvantaged by the abolition of the Commonwealth industry places scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister Vanstone, having been a poacher in higher education for so long and so comprehensively, is now trying to turn towards 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> being gamekeeper, trying to argue that this $26 million of crisis management funding will have a lasting impact. My recommendation to the government is to use it as early as possible in compensating universities like Charles Sturt and Deakin University based in Geelong in Victoria for the severe impact of the abolition of the successful Commonwealth industry places scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other decision reflected in this legislation&mdash;the introduction of a discount of 25 per cent for up-front HECS payments of $500 or more commencing in 1998&mdash;is also a minor concession only, a minor concession indeed. The whole range of students, a whole generation of young Australians, who have been turned away in their aspirations for higher education by the massive changes in HECS will not be the ones who will benefit from this minor discount of 25 per cent for up-front payments of HECS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, to have the discount on the up-front payment, it is not likely the most disadvantaged students will have that money available. Again this concession, minor in its nature, is also poorly targeted. It is the students from the lowest socioeconomic bands that require assistance, given the nature of the HECS changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that the government needs to reverse its priorities. I placed a question on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> to the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan), in acknowledgment of the quarantining of defence expenditure, to ask about the expenditure by the Howard government on Department of Defence golf courses. The answer came back that there are 20 such golf courses around Australia at a public cost of $3.4 million.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is $840 million being wiped out in funding for higher education. For the governments that sit in South-East Asia, in Europe and in North America and look at Australia and our future prospects, they must be curious indeed to understand what sort of government would quarantine expenditure on 20 Department of Defence golf courses whilst, at the same time, making higher education its No. 1 target for budget cuts. What sort of government would run down opportunities for some 21,000 students who are now unable to get into our university sector while enabling its defence forces to play golf on their 20 golf courses at a public cost of close to $3&half; million? That is an absurd set of priorities&mdash;an absurd and damning set of priorities for the Howard government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="LEE" NAMEID="MG4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Why can't they lease the golf courses, just as everyone else does?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="K26">Mr LATHAM</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course. They should be leasing out the golf courses, and they should be growing the higher education sector. They are the priorities you would find from a Labor government. Growing higher education access is the best opportunity for Australia to have decent economic and social prospects into the future. We all talk about competition in the world economy. We all talk about the new instruments of national sovereignty in the economic and social debate. There is only one lasting answer: it is in educational opportunity; it is in growing higher education access. But the Howard government has a different set of priorities. It is the quarantining of expenditure on golf courses for the Department of Defence, and its No. 1 targeting of expenditure is in the education area. These are perverse priorities which, undoubtedly, will lead to perverse national outcomes in the years ahead.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other aspect that needs to be raised in this debate is that there will be a further one per cent cut to operating grants applying in the year 2000, a further funding reduction of $47.3 million. The minister all up, out of the $840 million, and now the further one per cent cut in the year 2000, has tried to claim that the savings are small. She lectured the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> vice&hyphen;chancellors that they could not expect to be immune from expenditure cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But this is the double speak of Senator Vanstone in Orwellian mode. One moment she is saying that these are not cuts; they are just nicks. The next moment she is saying that they are small, but when pressured about her failure as minister and why she is so unpopular she runs out the line that she alone was responsible for the most extravagant amount of funding cuts and fiscal consolidation in the first Costello budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She cannot have it both ways: she cannot blame the Treasurer (Mr Costello) for the huge cuts in her portfolio for her own unpopularity and then try to turn around and say that universities are thriving and the funding cuts have only been small. I think the latest version of this Orwellian double speak is to say that the funding has not actually been cut; it has been capped. This is the double speak of saying that cuts equal growth, that reduction is good, that contraction of the university sector is just fine, that the universities are thriving&mdash;total double speak in the rhetoric and public performance of Senator Vanstone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Vanstone is now describing the cuts as the `removal of promised growth in the forward estimates' and calling Labor's forward estimates `not a credible base against which education expenditure can be measured'. Again she is conceding there are cuts. There are cuts that have a huge and lasting impact on the higher education sector. Her whole credibility on these things is shot to pieces.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cuts do impact severely on universities, and I can provide a survey of that to the House&mdash;and it only is a survey of some 10 institutions. I am pleased to provide this information to the House. It really represents the on-the-ground impact of these funding cuts and what they are doing to each of the 36 higher education institutions around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the University of Ballarat, for instance, there are 53 redundancies in place; the engineering course has been revised as a new integrated course with a more restricted 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5411"> number of specialisations; the librarianship course is completely removed for all new students; there are reductions in the number of graduate diploma in computing and information technology courses; music courses and performing arts are being curtailed; chemistry offerings are being reduced; the library opening hours are being cut by 11&half; hours per week. This is the on&hyphen;the&hyphen;ground impact at the University of Ballarat of the huge, swingeing funding cuts introduced by Senator Vanstone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn to the University of New South Wales. There is the complete closure of the St George campus. What sort of country wanting to be competitive in the global economy, wanting to grow opportunities for young Australians, actually gets in the business of closing down a complete campus, as it has done with the St George campus of the University of New South Wales? Also, at that institution a further 110 staff, including approximately 50 academic staff, are to lose their jobs. Most jobs will be lost as the courses are phased out over the next two years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Victoria University of Technology has put in place a voluntary departure scheme, with 60 staff targeted and a further 60 maintenance staff expected to lose their jobs as services are contracted out. The number of tutorials at the Victoria University of Technology has been reduced either by enlarging class sizes or replacing tutorials with lectures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the University of Adelaide, in the minister's home state, a total of 91 redundancies have been put in place. Drama courses have been abolished&mdash;indeed, phased out over the next two years. The education course has lost eight of its 15 academics, with a consequential reduction in student enrolments. Other departments such as history, animal science and crop protection will no longer be offering course options due to the redundancy of their staff. Again, here is clear evidence of the on&hyphen;the&hyphen;ground impact of the reduction of educational opportunities around the country because of the minister's cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These institutions are not thriving. These institutions are suffering. As they suffer, Australian students suffer. As students suffer, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the whole nation is much diminished in its future prospects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn to the University of La Trobe, which I will be pleased to visit just this Friday, where 144 redundancies are being put in place. French courses are being phased out; the Italian department is to be halved; there are reduced subject offerings in courses such as history. At the Bendigo campus of La Trobe university, 78 out of approximately 400 staff are losing their jobs. As staff go, courses go. Science and engineering courses are now under threat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The University of Tasmania, which is so important to the island state, is such a prospect. It really should be built up as the best way of holding talented young Tasmanians in their home state. Yet 160 jobs have been lost at the University of Tasmania&mdash;80 to date by the redundancy program&mdash;Italian courses have been axed and there have been decreases in a range of subjects such as physical science and Asian studies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology is estimated to be forcing the loss of 110 tenured academic and general staff, as well as 40 contract staff who will not have their contracts renewed. At the University of the Northern Territory approximately 70 academic general and TAFE staff have left on voluntary departure packages. Further staff cuts, a total of 75, have been experienced at Flinders university, with courses being affected accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there is the University of Sydney&mdash;not only my alma mater but also that of the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott). Indeed, I first got to know of the member for Warringah on the toilet walls of the University of Sydney where a number of reflections had been made on his parentage&mdash;things, of course, that I could barely repeat here in the House of Representatives. But it is always interesting to catch up with the member for Warringah, knowing of those days and how he is now aiding Minister Vanstone in running down these educational opportunities.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is true. If the graffiti had to be identified and revised for 1997

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="K26">Mr LATHAM</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. It was said of Clyde Cameron that he might just be a footnote in history. I think the parliamentary secretary deserves a better place than associating himself with the closure of technological and applied studies undergraduate teaching training courses in the Faculty of Education at the University of Sydney. That is not a good legacy for a former president of the student representatives council at that institution. He knows full well from his alma matur the swingeing impact of these cuts. Courses are being lost. Even for a university that foolishly has made access for the up&hyphen;front undergraduate fees, courses are being lost. The capacity of the university overall has been run down.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I make mention of the Australian National University where some 150 staff redundancies have been put in place with a consequent series of threats to their courses and student options. There is no doubt that the minister is in a state of denial and a state of delusion. I have given to the House the impact of her cuts on some 10 institutions, but it is repeated in the other 26 essentially right around Australia. The courses lost, the staff positions abolished, the students denied their educational opportunities show comprehensively that Vanstone has entered a state of delusion, a state of denial where she can rationalise these things only with Orwellian double speak. To say that universities are thriving is an out and out untruth. It is not matched by the courses and opportunities that are being abolished across the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another important point to make and one which is of great concern to many universities is the stability of funding and the basis on which they might conduct their future planning. Labor recognised this and legislated funding for universities on a rolling triennium basis. All the details were spelt out in the annual higher education funding reports. Before the election the coalition committed itself to continuing the rolling triennium arrangements, but this promise unhappily has 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> gone the way of those on operating grants and those on HECS&mdash;that is, it has been junked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Labor's last budget in 1995, we legislated funding for universities to cover the following three years. In the two budgets since the election, however, there has been no move by the coalition government to provide base funding beyond 1998. Large fixed capital universities are facilities that require some forward planning. There is a great deal of uncertainty in higher education not only for the funding cuts, for the abolition of courses and opportunities or for the severe impact on student income arrangements but also for the lack of forward planning in the forward estimates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The university administrators are trying to plan well ahead as they cope with the cuts, but this is made more difficult by the absence of an allocation of funding amounts beyond 1998. As a result of funding cuts&mdash;the funding cuts which the minister now seems to deny&mdash;there have been in total some 2,000 job losses and the closure of an entire campus, as I mentioned earlier. I am sure my colleague the member for Barton (Mr McClelland) will be addressing the concerns of the closure of St George campus in even greater detail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tutorials have begun to disappear, replaced by so&hyphen;called optional study sessions for which universities can and do charge. This is the creeping user&hyphen;pays approach that the government is propagating throughout the sector. The chair of the government's own review, Roderick West&mdash;almost an experience on the road to Damascus in recent times as he has toured each of the institutions&mdash;has acknowledged that the funding cuts have hurt universities. He is a latter&hyphen;day convert to the virtues of government funding.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="ABBOTT" NAMEID="EZ5">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EZ5">Mr Abbott</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He has recanted.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="K26">Mr LATHAM</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You have thrown him off the road to Damascus and put him back in the temple of Amanda. That is a sad thing to hear. There is no doubt in his public comments that the learned West, picking up the full benefits of learning in practice, having visited all the institutions, told the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>   newspaper that the funding cuts were hurting universities, that the level of public funding 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5413"> needed to be restored if we were to restore the health, confidence and success of Australia's university sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Vice&hyphen;Chancellors Committee&mdash;the board of which I was delighted to dine with last night without my tape recorder&mdash;in their submission to the West review called for an increase in government funding for higher education of over 20 per cent. The higher education round table warned in its submission to the West review:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Without a national vision and sufficient investment in our higher education system, Australia and today's young Australians are likely to be marginalised as the region moves towards higher living standards and more advanced social and political structures.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The round table members went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Institutions are struggling to find investment capital for new technologies and teaching materials, to restructure their physical and staff resources to meet new demands. A sufficient increase in institutional funding to assist in this restructuring and reinvigorating process is needed and justified. Government funding will have to provide the major source.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Whether it is Roderick West or the Business Council of Australia or the higher education round table or the Australian Vice&hyphen;Chancellors Committee&mdash;and I suspect in his quieter moments even Dr Kemp&mdash;everyone recognises that Senator Vanstone has thoroughly mismanaged higher education around Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the current environment, universities are struggling to meet the new challenges of internationalisation. I think there is a certain complacency in the Howard government about the future prospects of Australian universities. We have grown used to the idea of universities being a strong and growing source of export income for Australia. There is now a certain complacency in government policy making whereby, with the internationalisation of universities, we could face serious import threats.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At a time when Australia is running down R&amp;D, running down our standards and status for academics, running down our prospects to develop learning products in the new interactive technology, we place ourselves at a competitive disadvantage. We place ourselves at a competitive disadvantage that could turn 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the historic opportunity for Australia in export income in higher education into real import threats.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I urge the government at the very least to turn around the funding cuts in research and development, to turn around the prospects of Australian universities building up their expertise in the development of learning products. The international market for universities is very much emerging and will continue to do so for the next 10 or 20 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure that the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) appreciates these things better than most members. He understands the university sector in the United States. He would know that, unless Australia builds up its research capacity and its capacity to develop learning products, we will be wiped out of that internationalised market for higher education learning. This will be one of the sad and most unfortunate legacies of Senator Vanstone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the context of those problems and the swingeing funding cuts and the loss of courses, tutorials and opportunities around the country, this bill brings very little comfort. The government announced in the budget just past that it will provide $26 million over four years to help universities restructure and rationalise. This is code for hoping that universities might be able to cope with the massive funding cuts. Why is the amount not reflected in the additional expenditure provided for in this bill? Because even the rationalisation money is offset by yet another expenditure cut&mdash;the ending of the Commonwealth industry places scheme, a highly successful program to encourage industry investment and involvement in higher education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By 1999, CIPS would have been supporting some 4,700 full-time university places Australia&hyphen;wide with a concentration of those numbers at Charles Sturt University in western New South Wales and Deakin and Swinburne universities in Victoria. This was supposed to be a budget for the regions&mdash;a budget that had no cuts in education. But the  abolition of some 4,700 places is an enormous cut. When it is concentrated in just three universities around the country it is a cut that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5414"> is hard to handle. The bad news for universities like Charles Sturt is that the cuts effectively mean that some 200 jobs are now likely to be lost as a product of the ending of CIPS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The regional and newer universities have also been hit hard by the government's decision to allow full up-front fees for Australian undergraduates. So while Deakin, Swinburne and Charles Sturt are taking the huge cuts and the abolition of CIPS they have very little capacity indeed to levy the up-front fees. Yet it is the up-front fees that the government is using as the rationale for the abolition of CIPS. This is indeed a false economy. The universities that are losing places because of the abolition of industry schemes are not the universities that can compensate through the levying of the up&hyphen;front undergraduate fees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the sandstone universities who can trade on their prestige. They have some capacity to use the fees option as a way of making up for the funding cuts. I again point out to the House that they are not the universities that have been accessing the Commonwealth industry places scheme. To quote Professor Gavin Brown, Vice&hyphen;Chancellor of the University of Sydney, speaking on Sydney radio earlier this year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It's the only mechanism left to fill the huge funding gap which has been bequeathed to us by Amanda Vanstone.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Even vice&hyphen;chancellors supporting fees recognise that it is only happening in universities because, for all intents and purposes, they have had a funding gun held to their heads. For other universities, the outlook is even more unsatisfactory. A bleak future for universities equates to poor prospects for Australian students, especially those whose parents do not have a spare $100,000 to spend on a full fee university education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Vice&hyphen;Chancellor of La Trobe University, Professor Michael Osborne, has voiced a clear warning about the direction of Australian universities under the Howard government. He has predicted that the ability to pay will carry greater weight than academic merit for university enrolments resulting in a fall in the quality of education. In a recent issue of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">La Trobe Bulletin</EMPHASIS> Professor Osborne said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will be interesting to observe how long the resolve to preserve standards will be sustained if the students willing to pay are for the most part well below . . . standard.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The vice&hyphen;chancellor also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One student may fail to secure enrolment to his or her preferred course by virtue of a single mark and through want of means have to miss out while another more affluent student, whose marks are considerably lower, can still purchase entry to the same course.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">At a time when economic globalisation and restructuring are polarising labour market earnings and opportunities, governments need to do more to ensure that education acts as a genuine tool of social justice and access in Australia. But this is a government creating two tiers of university access: one for the wealthy who, even if they underperform at school, can still get a place at university by paying their up-front fees and a different tier of access for those who are left out because of the way in which tertiary education is being wound back by this backward looking government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The University of Western Sydney recently reported that 15 per cent of its students have now been discouraged from pursuing a university education. By creating two tiers of university access, the Howard government is adding to the inequality and fragmented opportunities in our society. In May, the Anglican Social Responsibilities Committee of Melbourne&mdash;maybe they do not have a lot of weight with the member for Warringah but I believe other members might heed their call&mdash;has described the introduction of the up-front fees as `a deliberate shift away from a commitment to an egalitarian society'. In its submission to the West review the church committee also said&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mr Abbott interjecting</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="K26">Mr LATHAM</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am reflecting on past training and inclinations, of course. The church committee said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . almost certain that a free market in education will in time weaken faculties and/or departments and/or universities which are already relatively impoverished. </PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">If the parliamentary secretary is supporting the Anglican Social Responsibilities Committee in their assessment of the reforms, I welcome that. At a time when the minister is fond of describing a university education as 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5415"> a privilege, she needs to understand that so many Australian students are not able to access that particular privilege. Increasingly, students see a university education as an emerging necessity for employability in the new economy. These economic realities point to the need for mass vocational education in Australia rather than the Vanstone view of an elite fee paying access.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has also compared universities to a used car sale yard saying that some degrees are worth the price of a used Commodore. In truth, universities do not work very effectively as an open market. It is also worth recalling the words of Roderick West, who on 28 May this year said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There's no doubt about it, there's such a strong link between higher education participation and expenditure and economic and social wellbeing. So there are very compelling arguments for continuing substantial public support.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Those views are reflected in the amendment that I have moved and advocate to the House. It is very important to have a properly resourced university sector. It is important for Australia's economic and social wellbeing. We express our concern about the impact of the government's cuts in higher education. We express our concern about the ending of the successful Commonwealth industry places scheme and note in the substance of this particular legislation that the $26 million allocation in crisis management would not be needed if the government had not caused so many cuts and so many sources of distress and unequal opportunity in higher education in the first place. On balance, the Labor Party does not oppose the discount of 25 per cent for up-front HECS payments of more than $500, but again we point out that this is a poorly targeted measure which will not assist those students who have now been discouraged from taking up their university education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is nothing more damning for this government than the fact that it has quarantined Department of Defence expenditure while making education its No. 1 funding cut. There is nothing more damning on this government's record than the sorts of figures released by DEETYA; to see that there has been a 3.4 per cent decline in applications for 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> universities Australia&hyphen;wide&mdash;a fall in New South Wales and the ACT of 4&half; per cent, in Victoria close to five per cent and Tasmania 3&half; per cent. In Senator Vanstone's home state of South Australia, the drop was 11 per cent overall.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What sort of minister can live with herself and her policies knowing that one in 10 students in her own state have been turned away from their aspiration for a university education? So much for the clever country. So much for a government that has a clear sense of Australia's national interest and where our best investment could be made in our national sovereignty. They deserve to be condemned. I hope the House supports my amendment accordingly.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The contribution of the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) tonight was a bit light on. I expected a bit more fire and brimstone. I suspect the speech will read as an utter condemnation of the government, notwithstanding the fact that he really supports this bill. In general, I will comment on some of his remarks later in what I want to say.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No.1) 1997 incorporates measures that will contribute to the government's aims of a higher education sector that is responsive to student needs and efficient in its operation. The purpose of the bill is fourfold: first, to provide funding of $9,658,000 for price movements affecting some areas of universities' activities, including such items as superannuation, grants to teaching, hospitals and special capital projects; secondly, to provide $26 million over the next four years to fund the rationalisation and restructuring program as announced in the budget; thirdly, to increase the number of students to be able to benefit from the 25 per cent discount for up-front payments of HECS by allowing for a discount for partial payment; and, fourthly, to make HECS debt more flexible for those students who withdraw from a course of study.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5416">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So to those issues. First, the bill introduces measures to maintain the real value of Commonwealth grants to higher education institutions for superannuation expenses, open learning organisations, teaching hospitals, special capital projects and for certain other grants, including equality of opportunity, research, multimedia, innovation and quality assurance. The total increase as a result of this measure will be over $9 million in additional funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Werriwa talked about universities abolishing courses and talked about rationalisation. He said that the government was complacent in its approach to higher education. I find that somewhat contradictory. The member for Werriwa, as I listened to his comments, apparently wants us to maintain the same system we have had for many years&mdash;a system which was gradually changed year by year by Labor in power over 13 years. But the member for Werriwa wants to keep it as it is or perhaps he would like to go back to the Whitlam days. Perhaps he would like to go back to free tertiary education for everyone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Is that what the member for Werriwa, the shadow spokesman for these issues, wants: to go back to free public funded tertiary education for anyone in Australia who happens to meet a particular TER cut&hyphen;off score? Is that what we want? I don't think so. When your mob was in power what did we get? We got HECS, didn't we? You said that the students need to make a contribution. We agree with that. We have changed the relativities that were left by Labor to ask for a greater individual contribution from students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said many times, this business of education is one where there is benefit, I think, to three parties. The first, and I acknowledge this, is a benefit to the nation. A highly educated population and a highly educated work force is of benefit to the nation overall. We inject into society ideas and thoughts, the ability to learn, the ability to carry forward, to move forward, to change, to adapt to new situations. Certainly this House knows how rapidly the world around us is changing. We know we have to change to meet the challenges that face us. The brick 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> walls are gone. Fortress Australia has been long since torn down. We cannot live behind those fortress walls. The modern world of telecommunications has brought the world so much closer together.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the emerging giants in wealth, in growth in education and in growth in industrial capacity, particularly the tigers through Asia, give demonstration to the fact that the world is on a chain. We have not reduced poverty yet, but we are making some inroads into it. I think it is very important that we continue that. We have to learn to live in a world that is changing. It is different than it was last year and the year before and the year before that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To pretend that because the public receives benefit from higher education we can take public money from those who will never have a chance to go into university, take their taxes, and use it to support those who are more privileged and who have a chance of going on to university by virtue of their efforts in secondary school, to say that the public must continue to entirely support this micronism of our economy, is an absolute nonsense, because the second beneficiary of tertiary education is the student. The one who obtains the degree also is a major beneficiary, perhaps the greatest beneficiary of all, out of the education system itself. The individual not only acquires an ability to learn and acquires knowledge but also acquires skills in some particular vocational area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We talk about TAFE being vocational training. University, to a very large extent, is vocational training too. Lawyers learn about the law; biologists learn about biology; engineers learn about engineering and science; and so it goes on. So there are skills imparted by universities. Individuals benefit from those and they also benefit from jobs which are more readily obtainable at entry level with that piece of paper. They also receive higher remuneration for that piece of paper, not only at entry level but generally throughout a person's career, whether they stay in the same  field or move on to another field. So higher education is a great benefit to the individual.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5417">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third sector of society that benefits from education is industry, business, commerce and, indeed, the public sector as well. They obtain the knowledge, the benefits, the skills, the ability to learn and the understanding of the students who exit the university system, having successfully completed their courses. They use them at entry level and later to expand their businesses or to help us do a better, more effective job of running the public sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Australia, that mix between public sector, individual and industry&mdash;if I can use that terminology&mdash;has always been biased in favour of the public sector. So we took the English model and we said, `We the public will pay for the students.' Labor in power decided that the students had to make a contribution. In this world where resources are scarce, where they are thin on the ground, where it is important for us as a nation to demonstrate to ourselves and to outsiders that we care about deficits, that we have to run a tight ship in the macro-economy, it is important that we recognise we must constrain spending. So it is entirely equitable that the students pick up a larger portion of the expense incurred in giving them that higher education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia has accepted it. We have not lost university students as a result of the government's measures. The university sector is expanding. The member for Werriwa amazes me. He said in his contribution that courses have been abolished. Of course courses have been abolished. When this issue was running around the traps last July and August, when it was really rampant and everybody thought the world would come to an end because change was going to come to the higher education sector, several vice-chancellors told me, `Thank goodness it is happening. We have got courses in our curriculum that have been here for so long, that are so outdated and so unnecessary they are propping up professors that are tenured. They insist that this course must stay in the curriculum, so we have to continue to run it. But it is of no cost benefit to the university. It is of questionable benefit to the students who are required to take the course.'</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This, along with the industrial relations reforms through the Workplace Relations Act, is giving universities the opportunity to make change, to restructure, to get rid of some of the dead wood. We are not even talking about driving for tomorrow. The member for Werriwa says that there is a bleak future for universities because all of a sudden they have to find a bit more of the money themselves. It is only a little bit. Students have to pay a bit more for their courses in differential amounts, depending on the benefit they are likely to receive from those courses. He sees a bleak future for universities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the country that I grew up in, I paid for my university degree&mdash;and most people did. That is how you went to university. Industry paid one heck of a lot more contribution into the tertiary education sector than ever we have had it paying in Australia. I have thought about that some. I have thought about why that is. I think it is because we have said to industry, business, commerce and the public sector, `The government is here to take care of you. The government will pay for education. Every child who is capable will have access to free tertiary education.' So why should industry bother? Industry says, `You are going to give me trained and educated people that can perform for me the modern miracles I need to compete in this highly competitive world. Thank you very much. I do not have to contribute.' What a nonsense. Of course industry needs to contribute. They do need to contribute and increasingly we need to find mechanisms to encourage industry to make their proper contribution to tertiary education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will happen. In the country that I grew up in, that has been a norm for 200 years. For 200 years business and industry have been contributing to tertiary education in a big way&mdash;in capital expenditure, recurrent expenditure and in scholarships for worthy students to attend university. So how on earth can we say that there is a bleak future for universities because they are starting to restructure a bit, starting to catch up with the 20th century and move into the 21st century? It is well past time that we did that. So this 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5418"> $9,658,000 will help those universities through part of their restructuring phase.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second issue that the bill deals with is to provide benefits to higher education institutions through giving the Commonwealth the power to provide funding for special grants for rationalisation and restructuring. This gives effect to the government's 1997 budget commitment to assist higher education institutions with restructuring and rationalisation activities where they lead to permanent benefits and where those activities would otherwise be beyond the capacity of the institution involved. That is, in essence, the government saying, `We know that we are taking a bit of the funding away and we have restructured HECS, and you need to start thinking about a changed world and how we are going to operate in the future to be able to afford to continue to educate the maximum number of Australians. You have got to start thinking about the future and you cannot live in the past.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Industrial relations reform is a very important part of that for universities. Instead of negotiating across the entire sector, departments, parts of departments or a university itself now have the flexibility to strike agreements with staff, teachers and professors in order to get the best value for money and still give the people who work in those institutions high incomes so that the most qualified people will be attracted to those positions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Universities will have available $26 million over the next four financial years to use in such activities as the collaborative use of resources, improved efficiencies in program delivery and the development of joint institutional infrastructure. A concrete example of the coalition's commitment to a vibrant and diverse university sector is this commitment in the bill. The measure gives institutions the opportunity to generate their own productivity improvements and to restructure their activities to take advantage of the new competitive environment for higher education&mdash;and it is a competitive environment. It will be increasingly so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An example is the new Berwick campus of Monash University in my electorate, a university campus that I fought for in the early 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 1990s. It is a new university with a limited number of places and yet it had over 4,500 concrete, first&hyphen;up applications for something like 250 funded places. I understand that the university has made a decision to expand by using its own capital resources because the Commonwealth was not able to assist. The Commonwealth felt that it was more important to fund growth areas in Queensland and New South Wales. That is the Commonwealth's decision. I might not be quite as happy about that decision as I should be, but people understand that I have concern for my area. I know that there are many students who need an education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Werriwa implies that kids are dropping out all over the place, that the number of students is falling and that there is a reduced demand. That is an absolute nonsense. The Berwick campus of Monash University proves the point of an unbelievably high demand for a few funded places. The institution will go ahead and expand, and that is an example of how the market ought to work. Their courses are excellent and they have provided an exciting challenge for students. Students are taking up the places in great droves, despite the fact that it is not a sandstone institution&mdash;it does not have ivy on the walls.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This measure will give the institution time to plan and adapt, and to pursue options opened up through the new flexibility available to charge fees. This program recognises that some institutions may need more help than others to better position themselves to meet the challenges of increased competition. There is no doubt that that is true. Not only does quality vary across the sector but, at the same time, how the institutions behave in certain course structures and their external reputation&mdash;all of these matters&mdash;have a part to play.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third issue which this bill addresses is that students paying at least $500 in up&hyphen;front HECS fees will be able to receive a 25 per cent discount. This extends the discount facility for partial payments for HECS. The measure is intended to encourage earlier repayments of HECS debt. I note that previ ously only those paying full HECS contribu 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5419"> tions up front were entitled to the discount. That discount facility has now been extended for all partial payments of at least $500.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Students are the ones who will benefit because this measure really helps to return equity across all the faculties. For example, an arts student paying a total HECS contribution of $3,300 up front was eligible for the 25 per cent discount but a law student would have to pay $5,500 to be eligible for the discount. All students are now treated equally, with all payments of at least $500 attracting the 25 per cent discount.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are saying to students, `If you have any money at all, if you have worked and saved a bit of money and you can afford to pay part of your fee up front, we will accept that part&hyphen;payment and that will ultimately help to reduce the amount of your HECS debt.' I suspect that many students will take advantage of that facility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final issue that the bill addresses is that it assists students by streamlining the arrangements for applications for remission of their debt under the HECS or open learning deferred payment scheme when they withdraw from a course. The current complex two&hyphen;tiered application period will go, to be replaced by a set period of 12 months&mdash;that is, students who withdraw from a course will have 12 months from the date of ceasing study in which to apply for remission of their HECS debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I support this bill, but there is no way known that I could support the Clayton's amendment proposed by the member for Werriwa. The purpose of his amendment is to indicate some annoyance with the government but, in reality, he does and will support the bill.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Interestingly, the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) made the comment before the suspension of the sitting for dinner that he had been educated in the United States as a full fee&hyphen;paying student; in other words, he paid for his education. He held that out with some pride. He may well be entitled to have considerable personal pride in that achievement. No doubt he made some sacrifice on his own behalf. One would also assume that his parents supported him. He is entitled to have personal pride in the fact that he paid for his university education. Those involved in the education system of the United States cannot similarly have that pride because it is a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> system that requires the payment of education which discriminates against the less privileged&mdash;those who, because of their backgrounds, simply cannot raise sufficient funds to pay for their education.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In many ways the contribution of the member for La Trobe was prophetic: in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> there was an article entitled `US&hyphen;style private uni funding predicted'. Reference was made to a recent publication of Professor Gordon Stanley in which he has made that prediction. To lose the equitable system that we have had, certainly since the Whitlam period of government, is something that should be of real concern to all Australians. It is fair to say that a number of people in this House would not be here, or certainly would not have their education, if it had not been for the fundamental shift in policy that occurred during the Whitlam period and which until now has really been regarded as a holy grail: if someone is talented enough, they will have the opportunity of studying at university.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have noticed, while sitting in question time in this chamber and from reading some <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of the other chamber, denials by ministers that there have been any funding cuts to tertiary institutions. Those denials are completely and entirely hollow. One simply has to look at the budget papers themselves, which state that the 1996&hyphen;97 budget reduced funding to higher education institutions by one per cent in the 1997 calendar year, three per cent in 1998 and a further one per cent in each of 1999 and 2000. Against the black and white evidence of those budget papers, which were distributed to the public, there is no way that any minister can deny that this government has cut funding to higher education institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The attitude of the government is demonstrated most profoundly in the response I received from the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to a question without notice I asked him on 5 June. I asked him:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Why has the government forced cuts of 1,900 student places and $14.4 million from the University of New 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5421"> South Wales and forced the closure of the St George campus, the only university facility in southern Sydney . . . </PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He replied with words that indicate the thinking of this government, which is often repeated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe that those policies will provide greater opportunities for Australian students. Those policies will relieve the heavy burden carried by the working people of Australia for the education of people from middle and upper income families.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is the underlying philosophy of the government: that the lower socioeconomic groupings have obvious difficulties in achieving the entry qualifications to university. He is saying that, because of those difficulties, we are shutting off, in a practical sense, their access to university because the raising of funds to a prohibitive level necessarily precludes them from entering universities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fortunately, those very narrow views&mdash;whereby you are suggesting that those who are poor are not capable of achieving university entrance, and thereby creating some degree of resentment&mdash;are not shared by the Australian public. A recent Newspoll survey showed that 73 per cent of those surveyed believe that universities are very important for shaping Australia's future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another question showed that 65 per cent of Australians believe that Australia should spend more than our Asian neighbours spend on tertiary education. In fact, that is not occurring. As the member for La Trobe indicated, these Asian tigers are really full&hyphen;on for developing their resource base&mdash;including their intellectual resource base&mdash;and we are falling way behind. Indeed, the survey indicated that 60 per cent of the people surveyed believe that the government priority for higher education investment is too low. Again, fortunately, the general population are much more broad&hyphen;minded than the government in their comprehension of the benefits of education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The criticisms of government policy have not been made only by Labor members of parliament or those involved in universities who perhaps have some barrow to push. I refer, for instance, to comments made by the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Anglican Church, reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 7 May. The comment was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The intrusion of a free market via fees into higher education . . . risked creating "deeper economic divisions within the social fabric which will, over time, lead to severe and possibly dangerous polarisation within the community."</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is coming from an objective source, albeit one which is  caring for the welfare of Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for La Trobe said there has been no reduction in university applications, despite the increase in fees. Quite frankly, that is not matched by the statistics that are occurring. According to a survey conducted by the University of Western Sydney of prospective students and their parents in the outer western and south&hyphen;western suburbs, as reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on 3 May, `higher fees were a major disincentive for many families, especially those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds'. So there is no question. It stands to reason that higher fees are a disincentive to poorer students. In fact, even if those students go on to tertiary studies, they are likely to choose cheaper courses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we are talking about choosing cheaper courses, many students now have to look at two options. One is the straight&hyphen;out HECS payments and the other is up&hyphen;front fees. For an arts degree, the HECS payment is now $3,300 and the up&hyphen;front private fees for 1998 are between $9,000 and $11,000 per year&mdash;so about $33,000 for an arts degree. For law, the fees are about $12,000 per year&mdash;about $60,000 over five years. An economics degree is the same&mdash;about $60,000 over five years. Science and engineering are $15,000 per year; veterinary science is $24,000 per year. So you are looking at closer to $120,000 which some people will be able to pay to buy a degree.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that, come October, there are going to be a number of students sitting in assembly halls, as many of us did when we were undertaking our higher school certificate. As I recall, it was one of the most stressful exams that I had, even considering the university exams that I went through. The facts of the matter are, however, that there are now 25 per cent fewer places available for students 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5422"> and they will be competing, effectively, for 75 per cent of places.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will say, `We have enabled universities to create an additional 25 per cent  of places by way of their funding.' But I have not seen any buildings being built; I have not seen an increase in staff at universities of 25 per cent. Indeed, I have not seen university resources expanding one iota. I have actually seen them decreasing. To suggest that there is going to be a 25 per cent increase in the capacity of universities is false; it will not occur. What will occur is a 25 per cent reduction in non&hyphen;fee&hyphen;paying places.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is repulsive and repugnant, and something that parents are really going to resent. Indeed, some children who are, it has to be said, fair, average quality students but with a wealthy mother or father will probably be going into that exam in quite a relaxed fashion, because they know that funds are there to pay for their degree&mdash;whether it be $33,000 for arts, $60,000&hyphen;odd for law or even $120,000&hyphen;odd for dentistry. Those who have the means of paying will be able to purchase 25 per cent of places.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Professor Osborne, the Vice&hyphen;Chancellor of La Trobe University said, it would surely be repugnant to all fair&hyphen;minded people:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that one student may fail to secure enrolment to his or her preferred course by virtue of a single mark and through want of means have to miss out while another more affluent student, whose marks are considerably lower, can still purchase entry to the same course.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Indeed it will be repugnant. I have discussed the consequences of the government's policy on individuals in terms of the effect it is going to have on Australia. I turn again to an objective source: the Business/Higher Education Round Table, which consists not only of academics but business leaders from companies such as the Advance Bank, McDonald's, CRA, Mallesons Stephen Jaques and IBM Australia and many other very significant companies. Of Australia's need for tertiary education, they said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia is likely to remain in the most dynamic region of the world during the lifetime of today's young Australians. Without a national vision and sufficient 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> investment in our higher education system, Australia and today's young Australians are likely to be marginalised as the region moves towards higher living standards and more advanced social and political structures.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They said, in commenting on the `Asian tigers' that the member for La Trobe referred to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our trading partners, particularly in our region, recognise the importance of education and training to their future and are investing accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Building national intellectual capital, available for industry to exploit, remains one of the accepted means to promote local industry and employment, a technique being embraced by Australia's competitors in international trade and commerce.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We are simply going to lose the game in comparison to the investment that other nations are making&mdash;specifically other nations in our region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To look at education in terms of a black and white balance sheet is wrong; it is an investment. Any businessman knows that if they do not invest in their business it will fail. We are simply not investing in our most prized asset, and that is the talent base of our nation. As another commentator said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The cost of Australian inaction will be that, as a nation, we are left behind . . . In a relatively short time, our national influence, prestige and ultimately our security could be undermined.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The talk was in terms of Australia reverting to the days of the 1950s and 1960s when we were regarded more as a quarry and farming paddock without the skills to value add. Other commentators have stressed, as I have, the contrast between what is occurring with our Asian neighbours with the tremendous investment that they are making.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there is any doubt that the government's policies have already affected the quality of education, I need do no more than refer to comments of Mr Roderick West, who is the chairman of the government's review of higher education. He is reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 28 May as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">University operating grants will fall 6 per cent against forward estimates during the four years to 2000.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5423"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tutorials had vanished in some courses. In others they had been cut from one a week to one a fortnight and group sizes had increased from 12 to 30. </PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr West said that there was little doubt that the sector is looking at further reductions. If the government's own adviser is expressing concerns, then all Australians sincerely have to be concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A matter which affects my constituents chronically is one which reflects a trend which will occur as a result of this government's policies. The member for La Trobe spoke of the United States example where universities canvass private industry for political donations. Professor John Niland, the Vice&hyphen;Chancellor of the University of New South Wales, is unquestionably a competent man and is well aware of what the university will have to do to attract those private funds. He has a policy of concentrating on the prestigious courses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Unfortunately, the St George campus of the University of New South Wales was not regarded by the university hierarchy as offering prestigious courses. The campus concentrates essentially on teacher education, sports sciences and some other faculties, but its real reputation is in teacher education. I think it is fair to say that it is the premier teacher education institution in New South Wales. Although I have not inspected other state institutions, I suspect that it is right up there among the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has developed a number of teaching techniques. In particular, it has essentially pioneered the use of computer interaction where students interact with the teaching process. The research as to the comprehension that primary school students obtain as a result of this constant interaction compared with sitting mutely looking at the blackboard is really dramatic. The teachers trained in these methods obtain outstanding results.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are looking at a situation where all education ministers in Australia have recently met and have expressed concern about a teacher shortage by the year 2003. Indeed, some suggest we will be short of the requirement by as many as 7,000 teachers.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we have this first&hyphen;rate institution but, because Professor Niland thinks that it is going to retard the prestige of the university in its endeavours to recruit funding, he wants to cut it adrift. Indeed, the university has placed in the local newspaper an ad calling for expressions of interest from other institutions which may want to lease the site. Despite the university site being one of the most demanded by students, the uncertainties and insecurities which have been caused by this whole event have resulted in a 30 per cent reduction in their teaching staff, which is a real tragedy, because it was a first-rate institution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note with some relief that in this higher education bill there is a provision&mdash;with the insertion of section 19 into the Higher Education Funding Act&mdash;whereby the minister can allocate funds for restructuring and rationalisation. My submission to the minister is that, if ever there were a cause for such funding, it is the St George campus of the University of New South Wales. There is a proposal, which is a very viable proposal, for that campus to be taken over by the University of Wollongong. It appears the state Minister for Education and Training, John Aquilina, will cooperate in that process. All politicians&mdash;be they Labor or Liberal, local or state or federal&mdash;are cooperating. All that is required is sufficient funding to facilitate that transfer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very much a situation where the ball is in Senator Vanstone's court. I would implore her, in view of the circumstances that I have outlined, to look very hard at the situation, because I think St George campus has to be right up there at the top of priorities. I hope other members on the other side of the House will echo my views to the minister.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am always surprised when I stand up in this House. It surprises me that I am actually here; it surprises me that I am actually the member for Lindsay, which has traditionally been Labor's heartland; it surprises me that I won the election on 2 March; and it especially surprises me that I won the by-election on 19 October. But when I listen to members on the other side speak about this particular issue, I realise why their basic 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5424"> constituency turned to the Liberal government for salvation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They express concern for the lower socioeconomic areas getting access to higher education. There is absolutely no evidence that there has been an increase in people in my area gaining access to universities by the price with which you have to pay for a degree. It has had no bearing whatsoever on the issue. In fact, the work force in the area of Lindsay out in western Sydney&mdash;which also houses the Nepean campus of the University of Western Sydney&mdash;have an average income of around $35,000. It is mainly made up of a trades and retail and labouring work force, with a small percentage of tertiary educated people. They pay&mdash;and they are quite aware that they pay&mdash;for higher education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor government at no stage in the last 20 years helped them out with their businesses or their careers with a massive injection of funds to get started on the road to a very profitable earning capacity, yet they pay for higher education. What is keeping my constituency out of university is not a higher education contribution scheme; it is primary and secondary education. It is gaining the TER required to gain a place in university.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those issues must be addressed before I will even countenance the bleating from the other side that, `Oh, we should make higher education exceptionally free,' because remember that in 1975, when we introduced the scheme, we had colleges of advanced education and we had institutes of technology. They have all become university places. The explosion in university places has been an epidemic. In fact, at one time you had 10,000 places in law school. It has exploded to something like 25,000, which is nearly equivalent to the number of people who are actually practising law. So the taxpayers of Lindsay are paying for people to get a degree in a subject that they are unlikely to be progressing to employment in. How valid is that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a very hot issue with me, because it was a central plank to Labor's campaign in the October by-election. Ross Free, the former 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> minister for education, really was on ground that he was familiar with and comfortable with. He ran very hard in the Nepean campus of the University of Western Sydney. He campaigned largely on higher education and how unaffordable it was.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The scare campaign that Labor ran in the Lindsay by-election on higher education was astounding, and I am not surprised that a few months later the University of Western Sydney did a survey and found that a disincentive was the cost of higher education, because it got lost in that by-election. The fact that got lost was that you do not pay anything until you are earning a wage, and then you are paying back only a proportion of your wage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor scared their own constituency, and I have spent the last six months repairing the damage of that by-election and assuring the students in my area that they can get to university and it is worth while studying. I have instituted a scholarship program in years 11 and 12 to assist kids in my area to get extra tuition, to get access to books and excursions and to get access to other educational tools that people in higher socioeconomic areas have access to in order to get the high TERs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite apparent to me that the wealthy in Lindsay get high TERs and the wealthy in the North Shore get high TERs and those in the eastern suburbs get high TERs, but the battlers of Lindsay do not get those sorts of TERs. They do not have that assistance. They do not have those sorts of resources at primary school and then secondary school.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At least I am doing something about it. All Labor can do is run the most massive scare campaign in my electorate to scare every year 11 and 12 student&mdash;and even year 10 students&mdash;away from even considering higher education because, `Oh! I can't afford it.' It costs you nothing to get into university. If you get the TER, you do not pay back anything until you have graduated and are in employment. That also brings up the subject of compulsory student fees, which is about the only thing that you do have to pay, but we are even looking at addressing that.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5425">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the second bill coming through, we are clearly breaking down the barriers that prevent anyone in my electorate from gaining access to higher education. It is important because a lot of people in my electorate go to university as mature age students. As mature age students, they have the capacity to get the TER to enter. If they cannot get the TER to  enter, then they have the earning capacity to buy their place if they want to. So no longer are those people in the higher socioeconomic areas taking all the free government places. If there are none left for the people of Lindsay, we can buy our way into university just as Malaysian students can, just as Singaporean students can and just as the numerous Canadian students at the University of Western Sydney can.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a bit of an anathema to everybody in Lindsay to see these Canadian and foreign students out taking advantage of our superb education system when the people in my electorate cannot save up and go there if they want to. I think that is the important fundamental basis of this thing. We will finally see access gained by mature age students and those who have made their way in the world who did not necessarily get a big TER&mdash;because the very successful people in my electorate quite frequently did not go past year 9, but they have made it in trade, trucking, industry, building, retailing and restaurants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those people might want a university degree. I think they are entitled to buy one if they want to. This measure will see for the first time in 20 years the percentage of tertiary degrees in my area finally going up. It does not surprise me in the least that the people of Lindsay voted for the coalition government. We are offering them something that Labor never has. Labor simply took their taxes to provide free places for people from the wealthy areas of Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is important to repair a lot of the damage caused to the University of Western Sydney in that by-election. It is an exceptionally good institution. It is the third largest in New South Wales and the 10th largest in Australia. It has seven campuses across the greater western Sydney region. It is federated 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> under the Hawkesbury, Macarthur and Nepean network of administrations and it caters for the 1.8 million people who live west of Parramatta.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The university offers 700 undergraduate and postgraduate courses. There is an enormous choice of courses to do. It is diverse. We are not pumping people through multiple programs which are already oversupplied in the industry. We are linked very closely with businesses and industry in our region and are delivering education which will get them jobs in our region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the next 15 years, we will finally see students from the 670-odd schools in our area going to a university in our area and getting jobs in our area. For too long we have seen kids from our area go into the inner city to get their degrees and stay there. They have never returned to western Sydney. That has had a major impact on a number of areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part of the University of Western Sydney has a number of teaching and research facilities at the Westmead Hospital. It is one of the largest hospitals in the Southern Hemisphere. We hope that the Nepean Hospital can reach similar standards, but we need the professionals to come out and practise there. People with affiliations to the University of New South Wales, Sydney and downtown Sydney do not tend to come to the Nepean Hospital. We need to train our own school students and our own graduates in our own area and get them to stay in our area. This is something that we hope will occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The New South Wales government has approved the funding for extensions to the Nepean Hospital. But, as yet, we do not know what will actually be placed inside that hospital. I am very curious to see what is budgeted for the outfit of that hospital and whether we will get those sorts of facilities even further out west.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is my commitment to my region which leads me to stand up here today. I think it is really important to undo the damage done in that Lindsay by-election. It scared a number of people away from even considering a tertiary degree and it was exceptionally unfair. You will notice that in New South Wales 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5426"> there was a decrease in applications while some other parts of Australia had an increase in applications. When all the dust had died down, the enrolments were up. In fact, New South Wales overenrolled by more than 10,000 places.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is something the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, is to be congratulated on.  She has managed to make the savings that were required of her from the Expenditure Review Committee. She has managed to create more funded places and, on top of that, she has managed to create another 6,000 additional places nationwide that are funded as well as taking on 26,500 additional students. The fees from those students are rolled back into the university. The University of Western Sydney has negotiated for that money to be transferred into a 15 per cent increase in staff wages. That is a key thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has given a staff wage rise, increased the number of free places and increased the number of places that are able to be bought by those who do not get a TER all within the first 18 months of coming to government. That is something the previous minister&mdash;my counterpart in the Lindsay by&hyphen;election&mdash;had failed to do. I am not surprised that I stand here in this House representing the electorate of Lindsay today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The minister has done all these things in spite of the $10 billion black hole found on 2 March by this government. Nobody, if not the people of Lindsay, understands the repaying of debt and living within your means. The previous government left a debt of $10.3 million. It had been spending well outside its means. It had been spending largely on inefficiencies within a system that was not catering to the needs of my electorate. In response, the minister has delivered the savings required to get Australia back on track, and there has been minimal impact on universities. This government has funded staff wage rises; it has funded extra places; and it has established a loophole through which mature age or working people can seek to undertake tertiary education.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Too often in the past Australia has missed the boat in keeping up with modern technology. One example was the introduction of colour television. Australia took 10 years to move from black&hyphen;and&hyphen;white to colour television. Certainly, the fact that Australia was not in that market showed in the corresponding loss of production, programming and feature films. Australia was 10 years behind the American and other markets that had moved to colour earlier. This is certainly something that we are in danger of doing with on&hyphen;line services, and it is certainly something that we must watch with education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Education in our region has become a marketable commodity. A number of foreign students all through the South-East Asian region look to Australia as having the highest calibre of education available, and they are prepared to pay for it. I think it is important that education, as an export resource, is recognised and used to stimulate our economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A recent report commissioned by the UWS shows that university education enhances gross regional product in our area by $280 million annually, and it boosts regional employment by 4,800 jobs. Although only 50 per cent of the staff live in the region, two-thirds of staff income is spent in the region. If we can make our universities major export industries, then there are even further spin-offs for the people of Lindsay. If we stay at the forefront of education, we can certainly do a lot for our region, for our people and for our deficit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The minister should be congratulated on the excellent job that she has done on this bill. It was a difficult task. She has shown outstanding talent and compassion in dealing with a difficult subject.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party had a lot to gain by bashing and knocking her policies, and by scaring the people of Lindsay over that period from the budget through to October. It did not wash. The figures there now show that it did not wash. If anything, I believe that speakers following me should apologise to the minister, as well as to the people of Lindsay. The scare tactic the Labor Party used in that by&hyphen;election 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5427"> was shocking. On all accounts the results show that there was a disgraceful, scaremongering, sky&hyphen;is&hyphen;falling campaign which was not in any shape, fashion or form responsible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has delivered a very responsible initiative. It positions Australia to go forward in this field enabling all Australians to access, at some stage in their life, a higher education and allowing them access to information, research and technology as our nation  moves further and faster towards a leading role in our region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think also the UWS has inextricably linked itself with the community in my area in a number of sports. For the first time the university is providing a number of sporting facilities, and drama, music and art facilities, that we have not seen in western Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do not forget, Mr Deputy Speaker, that western Sydney is Labor's so-called heartland yet there are no major facilities for sport, music, drama, theatre or regional museums; they do not exist. University campuses traditionally hold excellent facilities in all of those areas that are accessible by all the community. I think it is about time that western Sydney finally had access to those sorts of facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The University of Western Sydney, under the stewardship of Deryck Schreuder, has gone a long way towards achieving those goals. It has not lost any funding; it has been capped, as has been admitted by the President of the Australian Vice&hyphen;Chancellors Committee, Professor Fay Gale. It was capped, the funding was exactly the same, and they have managed to do more with less. That is all we have asked of anybody. That request by the minister has not been unreasonable. It has simply addressed the 13 years of rot and spendthrift ways of the Labor Party that had spent the hard earned dollars of the taxpayers of Lindsay. The people of Lindsay are finally getting their own back by putting me here in this place to represent them. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Listening to the honourable member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly), one would be 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tempted to conclude that over 13 years the previous Labor government did nothing in the area of tertiary education. But, of course, what we did over those 13 years was to rectify 23 years of absolute neglect of Australia's tertiary system. If you want to look at statistics, funding was massively improved over that period; and access by ordinary Australians, the sons and daughters of working people, was massively increased with a doubling of the tertiary intake.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Lindsay talks about the rot of the last 13 years. I wonder how she would have coped with a treasurer who left the Australian economy with an inflation rate in double digits, a growth rate in a negative phase&mdash;that is, losing thousands of jobs a day&mdash;and who left the incoming government with a $25 billion budget deficit. I wonder what the honourable member for Lindsay would say about that legacy. We all know that that was the legacy left to Labor by none other than the present Prime Minister, John Howard, when he was Treasurer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have said before on the floor of this House and I will say again that I cannot believe so many economic ignoramuses have accumulated in one particular place: that is, on the government benches. The government of the day is the only group of parliamentarians in the Western world that can categorise a four-year period of four per cent economic growth, massive job creation, massive strides in maintaining the social safety net, breaking the back of inflation and having the best industrial relations record in Australia's history as being rot. That is exactly what the honourable member for Lindsay has said. I guess her statements to the House tonight merely demonstrate the point I am making: not only is there an economic ignoramus in the seat of Lindsay; they abound on the government benches.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The budget cuts that have been introduced by the Howard government in its first and second budgets really lead one to pose the question: whither the clever country? If Australia has a competitive advantage, if it has a cutting edge as far as its economic performance is concerned, then it has come primarily from the quality of its education 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5428"> system. In the state of Victoria we have seen a dismantling of a quality educational infrastructure by a state Liberal government, and at the national level we have seen massive assaults on the tertiary institutions of this nation by another Liberal government. One must ask the question: where is the vision of the conservative parties in this country?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia beyond the year 2000 will rely very much on the competitive edge that will be generated through the fruits of the labours  in our tertiary institutions. Our cutting edge will be in the area of education. What sense is there for us in destroying one particular leg of our competitive advantage? We are a very innovative culture as far as our industry is concerned. Our great Achilles heel has been putting the commercial and financial sector on a footing to take advantage of that innovative culture commercialising brilliant technologies and generating employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That has been our Achilles heel, but we have another one emerging now. It has been alluded to by people on this side of the House as we try to bring this particular government to its senses on the education front. The cutting edge for Australia beyond the year 2000 will be in the quality of its skills formation, and that will be generated in part from the expert tertiary institutions that we have developed in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can think of no greater act of stupidity than the wholesale dismantling of our education system at a state level, with a federal conservative government proceeding along the same path as we have seen in Victoria with the primary and the secondary schools sector. The one thing that will give us our competitive edge, the one thing that will secure the future of our children is the tertiary education sector, and this great visionary government led by that great visionary, the honourable member for Bennelong, has cut into it like no other government before it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all have a vested interest in ensuring that educational dollars are spent well. Nobody is denying that. What we are seeing now is a stupid dismantling of the tertiary education infrastructure. One really wonders about the vision of a government that would embark 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> on this particular course of action. In barely 16 months in office we have seen cuts to operating grants. We have seen increases in HECS charges and lower repayment thresholds which are deterring many students from even attempting to enter tertiary institutions. In the most recent budget we have seen perhaps the grossest act of stupidity&mdash;the reduction in the Commonwealth industry places scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I acknowledge the presence in the House tonight of the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur), who has associated himself with the very cuts to the university that is in his electorate&mdash;the one regional university that has established an international reputation in the area of distance education. The honourable member for Corangamite comes into this House proud of the fact that the government has ripped into the one particular program that has sustained the links of Deakin University with industry throughout this nation. He will wear it in his electorate. They are already after him in the Western District. It is very doubtful that he will survive another challenge. We will not see the member for Corangamite next time in this House, nor will we see the government which is spawning such stupidity in the tertiary sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen from this government the ending of the triennial funding arrangements for tertiary institutions in this country. One thing that Labor did in government was to give some certainty to the funding base for tertiary institutions. We put them on the correct financial footing to mount the challenges they needed to mount to take part in the global expansion of educational services that we have seen over the past decade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was Labor that positioned them. It was Labor that encouraged the universities into the export arena and developed a very strong export industry for this country in the educational field. It was Labor that encouraged the vast research that is the hallmark of Australia's reputation in South-East Asia and around the world. Testament to that fact is simply that many overseas students not only from Asia but also from Europe have decided 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5429"> to come to Australia to undertake their tertiary studies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that the honourable member for Corangamite is leaving the chamber. May well he do so because I know he is ashamed of the indefensible cuts that have taken place in the first and second Howard budgets and the emasculation of Deakin University's capacity to relate to Australian industry and to sustain a regional presence at their campus at Warrnambool.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did the Australian Vice&hyphen;Chancellors Committee have to say about this govern ment's attitude to tertiary and higher education in this country? They made a submission to the government's review of higher education. They stated in a press release:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . without sufficient investment in higher education, Australia's future wealth, prestige and even its security, could be undermined.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is a fairly strong statement not from a group of radicals in the Australian community but from learned people who have the interests of their sector and also the interests of Australia at heart. It is a fairly blunt warning. The press release goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The submission says that while Australia is currently well placed to take advantage of the dramatic economic growth of our Asian neighbours, the Government needs to understand that unless we match these countries and our OECD partners with higher education investment, our favourable position will soon be lost.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is not my future that is at stake here. I had the great fortune to be educated in a tertiary institution in Victoria. That great tertiary institution was Monash University. It is the sons and daughters of working people throughout the length and breadth of Australia that are having and will have in the future their opportunities curtailed by the funding cuts that have already been made by this government. The future of their country is being truncated. It is being damaged by the actions of a government that is ideologically driven and lacks vision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sentiment that was echoed by the Vice&hyphen;Chancellors Committee has been echoed as well by the business and higher education round table group. That group is representative of business people in this country and the heads of our tertiary institutions. They said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Without a national vision and sufficient investment in our higher education system, Australia and today's young Australians are likely to be marginalised as the region moves towards higher living standards and more advanced social and political structures.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Here is a very blunt warning directly from not only the leaders of our tertiary sector in Australia but also the business community. They had this to say to an ideologically driven government that seeks to slash and burn when it comes to the tertiary sector in this country:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That foundation of national intellectual capital will continue to demand (and justify) substantial public funding.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The government may well argue to us that the moneys that they have allocated in those two budgets represent substantial funding. It certainly does to a degree. But for us to keep pace with the demands of our own economic growth and the growing demands of the region we ought to be investing more dollars which are better spent and not cutting them back in this important sector of Australia's service industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to make a few comments about the university that is in my electorate and the electorate of the honourable member for Corangamite, Deakin University. It was one of Australia's first regional universities. It was established in 1971 in Geelong and it has grown and amassed a very formidable reputation as a quality tertiary institution, especially in the field of distance education. It is also a pacesetter in its links to Australian industry through its business arm, Deakin Australia. There are some 30,000 external or distance education students enrolled at Deakin and about 28,000 HECS enrolled students. So it is a fairly substantial operation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some 2,500 staff. Due to the funding cuts that have been instituted by this government, we have seen a reduction of some 200 in the staffing level in that particular institution. That has simply meant a weakening of the university's capacity to offer good courses to its students and to establish the links with Australian industry which are vital to its survival.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Deakin University has a campus in Warrnambool in the electorate of Wannon further 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5430"> down in the western district of Victoria. I was down in that area recently and some deep concerns were expressed to me about the future of the Warrnambool campus. Due to the government's tertiary education funding cuts, we have seen the termination of the education faculty and the degree that comes from that faculty. The Warrnambool campus has been stripped of its famous public relations course.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the government fails to understand is that these particular campuses are very im portant to regional communities. They are important in the level of staff that are employed there and the income flow that is generated in the local communities. They are very important links between the business community in the local area and the tertiary institution. They attract students and their families. Some of the students who go to the Warrnambool campus are external students and their families visit them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many spin&hyphen;offs for regional communities in having these campuses in their midst. What we have seen with the funding cuts that have been delivered by the government is a threat to that particular campus. The community is rallying to ensure that it survives. The government, realising the mistake that it has made in this area, has allocated some moneys, in excess of $25 million, to rural and regional universities in an attempt to paper over the cracks that have emerged since the funding cuts in the first two budgets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most devastating blow to Deakin University was delivered in the recent budget with the cuts to the Commonwealth industry places scheme of some $7.2 million. Deakin University will lose some 2,000 places due to these funding cuts. This program was the means by which the university had established very strong links with Australian industry. Its clients were the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Who's Who</EMPHASIS> of Australia's manufacturing sector: Ford Australia and Coca-Cola and, in the services area, Qantas and Ansett. Some very big companies have availed themselves of the services of Deakin University and the educational services provided through the Commonwealth industry places scheme.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At a time when the government was encouraging Australian universities to make these links with Australian industry, from the point of view of not only improving the networks and the linkages between industry and tertiary institutions but also improving the skill formation in Australian industry, it then removes the one program that was giving Deakin University an opportunity to establish these linkages and to develop alternative sources of funding for many of its courses. So, on the one hand, it is saying to the university, `Go out into the marketplace, develop these linkages and develop alternative sources of income so you can sustain your level of operations,' and, on the other hand, it goes to that one scheme that is Deakin University's strength and which addresses that very question that it is posing to the university. It is a nonsense for the government to proceed with this particular cut in its budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Professor Wilson, who is the Vice&hyphen;Chancellor of Deakin University, had this to say in the Geelong <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> of 15 May 1997 about these particular cuts to funding that have affected the university so badly:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is difficult not to be depressed about the Government's seeming inability or unwillingness to understand the need for human and capital investment in higher education as the best means for ensuring our longer-term economic strength.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is not me saying that; that is a very eminent Australian, a very eminent tertiary educator. It is a very simple statement. The government has no vision when it comes to the tertiary sector in this country. The cuts are doing untold damage to the tertiary educational infrastructure of this nation and, in the long-term, Australia's economic interests, its security interests and its social and cultural interests are going to be damaged by a short-sighted and quite pathetic government.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It gives me great  pleasure to speak to the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 1). For the first part of my address I would like to speak specifically to the bill&mdash;what the bill does and seeks to achieve&mdash;and then I would like to make some general remarks about the future of higher education under this government, why we are doing 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5431"> what we are doing in the general sense, and then address some of the remarks made by the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) and other speakers on the opposite side.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill further develops the government's reform program for higher education and it is necessary not only in its own right but through the need for fiscal consolidation. I certainly was privileged in one sense to be the product of a tertiary education system where I personally did not have to pay anything for it at the time other than to try to put some thing back into the system these days. The reality is that in Australia we can afford to spend only that which we earn. We cannot afford to spend social infrastructure on debt and the continual sale of assets. Every member of this place and every Australian ought to remember that this year we will spend $82 billion on health, education and welfare. That is far in excess of the $74 billion that will be raised by taxes on PAYE income earners, companies and also fringe benefits tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We cannot indefinitely spend more on those big ticket  items of health, education and welfare than all the money that is raised by taxation on income. The bill provides funding for price movements which affect items such as superannuation, grants to open learning organisations, teaching hospitals and special capital projects. In 1998, this supplementation will provide about $9.65 million to the tertiary education sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To further foster and develop rationalisation and restructuring by institutions, the bill enables them to receive special grants. Such a move should silence those who argued after last year's budget that the government had in some way turned its back on the tertiary education sector as it comes to terms with significant change. By assisting them with restructuring, institutions will derive permanent benefits from the $26 million that this measure will provide over the next four financial years. The program guidelines setting out the criteria and the procedures that will be used in assessing those activities are to be set down in disallowable instruments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The package is aimed at encouraging institutions to rationalise staffing, courses and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> infrastructure where educationally sensible to do so to achieve long-term efficiencies and create a more competitive higher education sector. Whilst education and certainly health care cannot simply be set entirely loose to the forces of the private sector, there is little doubt in my mind and I am sure that of the government's that a bit more competition in the higher education sector could only do the Australian taxpayer and certainly recipients of that education a lot of good.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To be eligible for assistance, proposals from institutions need to generate long-term benefits, benefits to them, and demonstrate that the cost of implementation is unquestionably beyond the funding capacity of the institution. Up to $5 million of the $26 million over the four years of the estimates will be available for the 1997 program year. The government will be especially disposed to proposals that are put forward by regional institutions&mdash;institutions frequently seeking to provide educational opportunities to working and lower income families. Ultimately, of course, the decision lies with the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The program to which this bill gives effect complements the assistance made available to institutions in last year's budget through advances of operating grants. It recognises that, by providing a modest level of assistance, institutions which do not have the same high level of total resources available to them&mdash;and that is largely the newer universities and those servicing lower income areas&mdash;that others have will be better able to reposition themselves to meet the challenges of increasing competition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to this, universities will also be able to apply for an advance to operating grants as a means of managing their cash flow and the consequences of structural adjustment. No interest rate is to be applied to these advances and universities have got up to three years to pay. I think many of us over the years, including myself, have been very critical of the intransigent inflexibility of government, but for a government to fund a system and to provide advances in this manner for what are basically long-term changes to higher education is something that ought to be applauded.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5432">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second major initiative contained within this bill is to encourage student repayments of the higher education contribution scheme. This will be achieved through a new provision which will enable students to receive a 25 per cent discount for any up-front partial payment of $500 or more. At the moment, only those students who pay their total HECS contribution for a semester up-front receive a 25 per cent discount. This measure represents a better deal for students, who can access the 25 per cent discount for partial up&hyphen;front payments of $500 or more. It  also addresses the anomaly of a student who might be enrolled in performing arts, for example, who pays his or her total HECS contribution of $3,300 and receives a 25 per cent discount for paying the full amount; whereas a dentistry student who might come from a low income background and who might want to pay the same amount cannot access any discount unless he or she pays the full up-front HECS contribution of $5,500. Making the higher education contribution scheme more equitable and workable for students is surely something people ought to support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When a partial up-front payment is made, the remaining HECS contribution will be deferred for payment through the taxation system. For example, if a student has a HECS liability of $2,350 for the first semester and he or she wants to pay $1,000 up-front towards that liability, paying this amount before the census date will reduce that deferred liability by $1,333 or 125 per cent times $1,000. Such a student's deferred HECS liability will be $1,017. If a student has a total liability of less than $500 for a semester and the full amount is paid up-front, a 25 per cent discount will still apply. A partial up-front payment can be made through a student's higher education institution and must be made before the census date of the relevant semester.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Five hundred dollars has been set aside as a minimum up-front payment. I have had one or two constituents making inquiries of me about this. We have set $500 as a minimum partial up-front payment to attract a discount as obviously the costs in processing diminish 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ing sums can be prohibitive and actually negate the effort the government is making for administrative simplicity. The discount for partial up-front payments will apply only to those of $500 or more that are made after 1 January 1998. Those students who have elected to defer their HECS repayments can still receive the 15 per cent discount for voluntary payments of $500 or more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also assists students by streamlining the applications for remission of their debt under the HECS or the open learning deferred payment scheme, otherwise known as OLDPS. Applicants will now have a set 12&hyphen;month period from the date of withdrawal to apply for remission of their debt. The measure addresses the inequitable situation of linking the application period to the census date and instead links it to the date on which the student can no longer continue his or her course, and that is the date of withdrawal. For anyone who is affected by this, whether it be a student or a parent, that is common sense in action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also addresses the complex two&hyphen;tiered application period, replacing it with a set period of 12 months. Until now, students had to apply within three months of the census date&mdash;31 March for the first semester or 31 August for the second semester&mdash;irrespective of when they withdrew from the course. An application for remission could be considered within a further 12 months only if the applicant could demonstrate that the special circumstances became known only after the initial three&hyphen;month period or if, because of circumstances beyond the student's control, it was not possible to apply within the initial three&hyphen;month period. Clearly, these measures will greatly enhance flexibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When a student is withdrawing from a course&mdash;sometimes through choice but sometimes through family or other personal circumstances, or sometimes through life crises&mdash;the last thing you want is to have to go through the nonsense that currently applies and the inflexibility of trying to sort out your HECS repayments and remission of them.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5433">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Administrative Appeals Tribunal, which has raised its concerns about the existing guidelines for remission lacking any legal basis, should be satisfied with the specification in the act of the secretary's powers to remit a student debt&mdash;either HECS or OLDPS&mdash;and empowering the secretary to issue guidelines for the exercise of this discretion. As a result of these measures, most students will actually have longer in which to seek remission of their debt. More students will be able to seek remission of their debt as they will not any longer be required to satisfy a two&hyphen;tiered application process to receive consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of members on the other side, and certainly some of the more vocal students in the community, who are continually berating the higher education contribution scheme system and, in particular, the changes announced to it by the government in last year's budget, along with some amendments to it since. The fact is that in 1988, when the HECS scheme was introduced, there were 186,151 students enrolled in Australian tertiary institutions. Last year that had increased to 235,253. The number of applications had increased from 283,465 in 1988 to 454,846 last year, and it would not have been possible without HECS. So, too, the long&hyphen;term viability of the higher education system depends on sensible and sustainable reforms to the higher education contribution scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we are to have a place in a tertiary institution for those young people and mature age students of the future who wish to have it, it does not seem unreasonable that those who are beneficiaries of this education be required to pay a proportion of it; and to have a system which requires payment essentially only when you earn a certain level of income seems eminently reasonable. Also, to provide a discount to students who are willing or able to pay up front or, as this bill allows, to even pay a portion of it, again, is a sensible initiative. When you consider that HECS funds only about 27 per cent of the cost of the tertiary education which the person is going 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to receive, it seems like a very reasonable system for us to apply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have listened to valuable contributions in this chamber by people from all sides on all kinds of issues. One of the less noteworthy contributions has come from some members on the other side who have argued about equity. I have heard people railing against the inequitable changes in higher education which the government has introduced. The fact is that as of last year 38 per cent of tertiary education benefits went to households with the top 20 per cent of average income and only 15 per cent of university students have come from the bottom 25 per cent of income earning households. That means that almost 40 per cent of the higher education dollar, most of which has come from low and middle income earning families in Australia, has been going to subsidise higher education for families with an average income of $84,000 a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst we may all have different notions of what equity is, I do not consider that equitable. The fact that most of the people carrying the tax burden in this country have funded the higher education of people such as myself from which I have derived a great benefit is not, in my opinion, an equitable way to run a higher education system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have read a number of editorial pieces that have been written about what the government has been doing in higher education, and one of the more interesting, if not provocative, ones is from Professor Michael Jackson, a director of the Civics Centre at the University of Sydney, who published a piece in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on 2 June 1997. I will quote some passages from it. He said:</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Professor Jackson went on to say that it should be clear that not all those without a HECS place are without intelligence. He then stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some of those who do well in the HSC feel superior to those who score less. Yet students with lower scores but greater motivation can unlock further talents in higher education, and so they should.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">My own experience in the world of medicine has shown that for every student who is successful in achieving a place in a university in medical school, there are 10 who have applied but miss out, yet who are academical ly capable of being excellent medical practitioners in whatever field they pursue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have seen cases where an individual student has achieved a TER of 88, 89 or 90 and missed out on a place in medicine. Yet at the moment in Australia we have 1,000 fee&hyphen;paying overseas students who will graduate with Australian medical degrees, a number of whom, by the way, will find devices that will enable them to stay here when they finish. Then we have Australian children of Australian citizens&mdash;a lot of those citizens, by the way, who themselves had been migrants&mdash;who are quite capable of being doctors in Australia and would reflect the multicultural nature of the country, apart from anything else, but they are not able to do it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1997 is essentially a very straightforward bill implementing the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5435"> 1997 higher education budget measures. In most respects it is essentially a piece of legislative housekeeping. It is essentially a steady&hyphen;as&hyphen;she&hyphen;goes bill which is designed to keep the higher education sector in good standing and good stead over the next couple of years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are four major measures in this bill. The first provides for supplementary funding of about $9 million to pay for changes to superannuation rates, to make certain cost of living adjustments to other funding and to  provide a safety net wage rise for university staff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second sets up a $26 million restructuring and rationalisation fund that will essentially help various campuses to better collaborate and cooperate. It will help them to jointly develop infrastructure. It will help fund the sorts of things which are already beginning to enable universities to develop, for instance, remote tutorials using interactive technology. It will help universities to better collaborate in teaching and in jointly offering courses and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, these are things which are already happening to a considerable extent in our system. I believe, for instance, that the Australian National University is rapidly becoming the centre of classics teaching in this country. A great university such as Melbourne University is continuing to offer, as it should, classics courses but it is doing so with the assistance of the ANU classics department. This is the kind of cooperation which this fund will facilitate. This will mean that small campuses will remain viable because they will be able to offer a full range of courses while at the same time specialising in the things that they have comparative educational and intellectual advantage in. That is a very important innovation brought in by this piece of legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third thing this bill does is allow students to claim a 25 per cent discount for up&hyphen;front HECS payments of less than the full amount of their course. Anyone paying $500 or more towards their HECS contributions will be able to claim the 25 per cent discount. This is an important equity measure and I am pleased to see that the opposition supports it.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final significance of this bill is that it introduces simpler and more liberal procedures for the remission of HECS charges for course drop&hyphen;outs. At the present time former students have a three&hyphen;month period in which to apply for the remission of their HECS. There is then a further 12&hyphen;month period in which they can apply on rather more stringent conditions. This bill provides for a 12&hyphen;month period in which to apply for HECS remissions provided, generally speaking, the relevant factor is severe enough to make it impossible for the student to continue the course, the factor which arose was beyond the student's control and the student did not know about this development before the census cut&hyphen;off period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting that the actual provisions of this bill have not been opposed. In fact, the opposition supports, with greater or lesser degrees of enthusiasm, everything in this bill. There are other things which, I suppose, flow from the bill that are criticised, but essentially the opposition supports all the things that are in this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have had from the opposition is an amendment attacking not this year's budget but last year's. The member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) in his contribution pointed out that the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) had been rather flat and disappointing. I did not agree with my friend and colleague the member for La Trobe. I thought the member for Werriwa was actually giving a typically spirited performance, despite the admonition of his leader to stop showing up the relevance deprivation syndrome of some of the member for Werriwa's most senior colleagues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Werriwa's biggest problem was that he simply could find nothing to attack in this year's budget and therefore he had to recycle old arguments from last year's budget. That is what he did tonight. Last week he was somewhat more up to date when he complained about problems with the Austudy hotline which had arisen in late January&mdash;problems which in fact the government had fixed by mid&hyphen;February and which Senator Stott Despoja had cottoned onto on 6 February. Senator Stott Despoja's press release of 6 February this year was almost 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5436"> entirely echoed by the member for Werriwa's press release on 5 June this year. It seems that the only person  still hanging on the end of the AMT hotline is none other than the member for Werriwa himself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Anyway, when the member for Werriwa got on to debating his amendments, he made four substantial criticisms. The first criticism was that the government had slashed funding and cut student numbers. This is simply untrue. The university sector is estimated to have  $250 million more revenue from teaching activities in 1997 than in 1996. Total Commonwealth operating grant funding is up by $147 million to $4.866 billion. Total postgraduate fee&hyphen;paying students increased by 22 per cent. Total overseas student numbers are up by some 9,000 and that is worth $92 million. Compared with 1996, total student load increased by 12,300. Compared with 1997 targets, universities overenrolled a total of 33,025 equivalent full&hyphen;time students. So there is more money and there are more students in our university system this year than last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Werriwa also said that research funding had been slashed. Again, that is not true. Last year's budget provided for an extra $90 million&hyphen;plus for research infrastructure. Under this government in 1997 there is $415 million for that targeted research. Next year there will be $443 million. Under the former government, the projections were $394 million this year and $399 million next year. So again the member for Werriwa is quite wrong in his facts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point that the member for Werriwa made was that individual universities were suffering disastrously from staff cuts and course amalgamations. He went through a list of campuses where various redundancies and course reorganisations had taken place. I would be the first to concede that this has not been an especially easy time for our universities. It is never easy to readjust, and yes, arising out of last year's budget, there were some very considerable readjustments for our campuses to make. But the fact is that fewer staff and reorganised courses are not necessarily a bad thing. It is my understanding that, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> when the member for Werriwa was the Mayor of Liverpool, there were indeed rather significant staff cuts and rather significant service reorganisations in Liverpool council. Was it a worse council as a result? Perhaps it was, perhaps it was not, but the point I am trying to make&mdash;and the point which, I am sure, the member for Werriwa would concede if he was being less one&hyphen;eyed&mdash;is that these things may be bad or they may be good, but to draw a long bow and to make sweeping generalisations is simply not on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He named a number of universities. I am not sure that I got them all, but there was Ballarat, the University of New South Wales, the Victorian University of Technology, Adelaide, La Trobe, Sydney and the ANU. He said that these universities had been devastated by cuts to funding. He said these universities had been devastated. What he was saying was that these universities are now devastated universities as a result of the policies of this government. I would be the first to concede that many of their vice&hyphen;chancellors have been critical of aspects of government policy. But would any of those vice&hyphen;chancellors stand up here and say that his or her institution is a devastated institution? That is what the member for Werriwa was saying. He was saying that each one of those institutions was now a devastated institution because of the policies of this government. It seems to me that the worst you can say about these universities is that they are coping. Probably it is more accurate to say that, whatever the vicissitudes of the last 12 months, each and every one of them is flourishing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He quoted Rod West, the head of the government's investigation into higher education, as saying what a shocking thing had been done. He obviously has not been reading all of the press as assiduously as he reads Glenn Milne's column because, if he had been reading all of the press, he would have seen that Rod West has denied what was attributed to him in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>. Rod West has issued a statement called `University Funding Cuts&mdash;The Facts' in which he has said that total education funding in 1997 was higher; that per student operating funding had remained stable; and that there had been `big increases' 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5437"> in research funding in the 1996 budget. That is what Mr West thinks about the federal government's changes, contrary to the words that were put in his mouth by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> and which were repeated tonight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third big criticism of the member for Werriwa is that the introduction of full fees for domestic undergraduates is producing rich, thick graduates and students. Again, the member for Werriwa has been indulging in a form of institutional defamation because that is far from what those campuses are saying.  Let me quote Professor Alan Gilbert, the Vice&hyphen;Chancellor of Melbourne University, who says:</PARA>

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first thing to say is that no system of higher education yet invented has been inherently equitable. The system of free public universities introduced by the Whitlam Government is a case in point. Incontrovertible evidence showed that participation in free higher education was always biased towards the middle and upper middle classes. The result was that relatively privileged young people gained the considerable benefits of a university degree with a de facto subsidy from less privileged taxpayers who never got to a university.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ironically, the principle of user&hyphen;pays, well managed, may actually promise fairer outcomes than the older alternative involving a subsidisation of middle class students by working class taxpayers.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">If that does not satisfy the member for Werriwa, here is Professor Fay Gale, head of the Australian Vice&hyphen;Chancellors Committee, who said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Universities believe in merit because that is what we are about but it is also true that it is a simple matter of institutional survival as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">No university which thinks beyond tomorrow will fail to consider the effect which falling standards would have on its reputation and its long&hyphen;term viability as a credible learning institution.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The final big attack was on the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, for being inconsistent. He made great play of the minister's description of what happened last year as, variously, a cut, a nick or a cap. I have got to say that this is a little bit rich coming from a member who once talked about taking a bit of good old&hyphen;fashioned Labor stick to the business sector. He has also, as I recall, praised aspects of Premier Jeff Kennett's health care reforms, including casemix funding, which produced one hell of a bunfight in this parliament with the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) before the last election. This is the same person who, in one breath, endorsed the higher education paper of the member for Sydney (Mr Peter Baldwin), which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some reports following the paper's release drew analogies between my model and the sort of scholarship (or voucher) proposals found in Fightback. I don't resile from thinking that it is time that those of us to the political Left&hyphen;of&hyphen;Centre took a fresh look at the way we view choice. Indeed, I believe we should make expanding the ability of all people to shape and control their lives to make choices&mdash;one of our core ethical goals.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is what the member for Sydney said and that is what the member for Werriwa endorsed. And yet, just a couple of weeks later, in his own education statement, the member for Werriwa said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Within this context, the days of the public sector seeking to fund choice for choice's sake are over.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So the member for Sydney supports choice and the member for Werriwa does not. And here we have the member for Werriwa standing up and slagging off the minister for alleged inconsistency. No doubt if the member for Werriwa were here he would make statements about foolish consistency being the hobgoblin of tidy minds&mdash;and of course he would be right&mdash;but he should extend to others the same latitude that he would no doubt claim for himself.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5438">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to say that I believe Minister Vanstone has been a great reforming minister. The changes she has brought to labour market assistance and to the Commonwealth Employment Service are the biggest changes in 50 years. They will ensure that our labour market services are geared precisely to what must be their goal: to get people jobs and not shuffle them through the unemployment queues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On higher education, Minister Vanstone has presided over the biggest changes in at least  a decade. At the same time, what she has done in higher education has not been revolutionary so much as it has accelerated an evolution that was already there. She took the former government's HECS system and refined it. She took the former government's acceptance of up&hyphen;front fees and expanded the freedom of choice. She took the diversified funding that the Labor Party introduced and built upon that. The minister has done an excellent job which has built upon some of the strengths that were left to her by the former regime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is appropriate to leave tonight's debate with some challenges for the Australian Labor Party. The member for Werriwa and others have been throwing down the gauntlet to the government and it is only right and fair that we should return the compliment.

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I pose these questions to the member for Werriwa and to his boss, the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley. Is the member for Werriwa and is the Labor Party&mdash;if it ever gets back into government&mdash;going to abolish the $26 million restructuring and rationalisation fund? Is the member for Werriwa&mdash;if he ever gets to be minister for education&mdash;going to expel domestic fee&hyphen;paying students from our universities? Is the member for Werriwa&mdash;if he ever gets to sit in a ministerial chair&mdash;going to immediately restore the $800 million to universities that he thinks the government has ripped off? Does the shadow treasurer have $800 million to give to the member for Werriwa to restore the cuts that the member for Werriwa keeps going on and on about? Because if the member for Werriwa is not able to do this, he is exposed as a con man: someone who says one thing in opposition and then does something completely different in government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one final point: some of the statements made by members opposite have helped to stoke the fires of anarchy which have flared up recently on a number of Australian campuses. The University of Sydney had its administration block invaded by a number of people&mdash;most of whom were not students&mdash;who smashed their way in and caused thousands of dollars worth of damage. The same thing has happened at a number of other universities, including Macquarie University and the University of Technology, Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Vice&hyphen;Chancellor of the University of Technology, Professor Tony Blake, said that those individuals were from external organisations. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is clear that the occupation of UTS Administration was carefully planned and involved a small number of UTS students and individuals and organisations with an agenda much broader than matters concerning UTS and its students.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He said:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition has no in&hyphen;principle objection to the Small Superannuation Accounts Amendment Bill, but we do have some concerns about it, which I will spell out in a little while, and which will lead us to support the reference of the bill to an appropriate committee in the Senate for consideration of those issues, report back and further consideration by us and, I hope, by the government, of some of its implications.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill deals with a significant issue, namely, the rules governing the early release of amounts within the superannuation system. I begin by explaining the background. A major impact of the superannuation guarantee scheme has been the creation of a large number of small balance accounts as people 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have entered the superannuation system for the first time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The superannuation guarantee system is a major achievement of the previous Labor government, one of which we are very proud. It will be shown over time to have been one of the great reforms in Australian history&mdash;simultaneously delivering financial security and improved standards of living in retirement and building a huge pool of funds for Australia's future development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Of course, by definition, all super accounts start at zero and do have a low balance inevitably for some time. For those with a secure job and a regular, reasonable wage that balance increases over time as contributions mount and compound returns start to accrue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The scheduled growth of the superannuation guarantee charge from six per cent today to nine per cent in the year 2002 will again mean that those balances will increase even faster in future years. That said, for a whole variety of reasons, some super accounts do not increase and, in the past, have actually decreased over time as a result of fees and charges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many part&hyphen;time and casual workers, predominantly women, receive relatively low wages and therefore receive low super guarantee contributions. These employees are the groups most at risk of having their benefits significantly affected by fees and charges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recognising the need to protect small super amounts from erosion, we in government required super funds to ensure that those administrative fees and charges could be no greater than the return earned for accounts with a balance of less than $1,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also recognised that some super funds might not accept the requirement to protect small amounts, and therefore complemented the small amounts member protection rules by establishing the superannuation holding accounts reserve&mdash;SHAR&mdash;through the Small Superannuation Accounts Act 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">SHAR is a superannuation collection mechanism administered by the Australian Taxation Office, to which employers who are unable to find a suitable member protected fund may contribute on behalf of their em 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5440"> ployees. It is a low cost vehicle for accumulating small super guarantee contributions until a request to transfer moneys to a superannuation fund is received from the employee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments contained in this bill propose to implement three of the government's 1997&hyphen;98 budget superannuation measures. These concern the tightening of the circumstances under which the early release of super benefits are to be allowed from 1 July 1997. But the bill applies only to the SHAR. The legislation dealing with superan nuation funds at large is still to come and we are awaiting it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently, the rules for the early release of superannuation moneys from SHAR&mdash;the superannuation holding accounts reserve&mdash;provide that the balance of a person's account may be withdrawn if the balance is less than $500 and the person has ceased to be employed by all the depositors; the person is in severe financial hardship; the person has retired because of permanent disability; the person has turned 65, or the person is not an Australian resident and is not employed in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Specifically, the amendments in this bill are designed to remove access to amounts in SHAR of less than $500; restrict the access of non&hyphen;Australian residents to funds in SHAR except where the individual has reached preservation age, which is currently 55; replace the current severe financial hardship test for access to funds in SHAR with a new test&mdash;this test being that an individual must have been in receipt of specified Commonwealth income support payments for a continuous period of 52 weeks or, if over the age of 55, a cumulative amount of 39 weeks after that age.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even though the announcement is couched in terms of a commencement date of 1 July 1997, I should note that the proposal does grandfather all requests which were provided to the commissioner prior to that date. Those requests will apparently be considered under the old rules.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition position on all of this can be described as follows. We recognise the need to prevent unnecessary leakages from the superannuation system, so we do not oppose 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the legislation in principle and we certainly will not be doing so now in this House. But we do have some concerns about the impact that these amendments may have, particularly on people who are genuinely experiencing financial hardship and who may not be able to access their super funds when needed as a consequence of this new, more rigorous test.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should say more generally that, despite the government's rhetoric about the healthy state of our economy, the recent jump in the unemployment rate to 8.8 per cent, the loss of more than 40,000 jobs in one month and the reality that we are losing jobs at the rate of 3,000 to 4,000 a month&mdash;as we need to create them at the rate of at least 15,000 a month if we are to even keep pace with present needs to maintain the rate even at its present level&mdash;all highlight the fact that many Australians are facing unemployment and of course that unemployment is without question the major cause of financial hardship for Australians at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Access to super in times of severe financial hardship may be the only way that Australian families are able to make ends meet. We are concerned, as a result, about the impact the government's amendments to the severe financial hardship test proposed in this legislation might have on Australians experiencing economic difficulties. Under the current test, individuals experiencing hardship can apply to the Insurance and Superannuation Commission for early release of their benefits. If the commissioner determines in writing that an applicant is in genuine severe financial hardship, the funds can be accessed and those applications are looked at and approved on a case by case basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While we recognise that an objective test of financial hardship is needed to prevent rorting of the system, we are concerned that the arrangements proposed may not allow, as I have indicated already, people who experience genuine severe financial hardship to get adequate access to their super savings&mdash;perhaps when that hardship is caused, as it so often is, as a result of retrenchment or redundancy. People suffering financial difficulties still have families to feed, mortgage payments to make and, increasingly, education costs to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5441"> meet&mdash;as people tend to have young families even at those ages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Imposing a test linked to the number of weeks a person has been receiving social security benefits or pensions, service pensions or income support supplements may, in practice, have too severe an impact on families. A situation might arise where a one-income family may lose that income due to retrenchment or redundancy and, although qualifying for an income support payment, will still not be able to meet its ongoing  financial commitments such as mortgage repayments. Should families have to default on home loans due to an inflexible severe financial hardship test and consequently risk losing their home?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So our situation in a nutshell can be, I think, described as follows. We do recognise the need to prevent leakages from the super system. We will not be opposing this legislation in principle but, equally in that context, we recognise the importance of building up a nest egg for retirement. Indeed, it was us, as I have indicated at the outset, that introduced the whole universal super guarantee system to allow all employees to have a nest egg&mdash;legislation that, I hope people remember, was bitterly opposed by the coalition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's approach to achieving adequate retirement incomes for all Australians does have these contradictory elements. On the one hand, there is a proposal to prevent access to very small super amounts of less than $500 to increase private savings. On the other hand, in the same budget the government is proposing a much greater loss to national savings by introducing so-called `opting out' for a person earning less than $900 and, of course&mdash;most significantly of all&mdash;by not delivering on the government co-contribution that was promised not only by us but by this government in the 1996-97 budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These two initiatives alone will lead to massively reduced levels of saving for retirement&mdash;much greater reductions than the sums it is attempting to prevent leaking from the superannuation system with the measures proposed in this legislation and the further 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> expected general hardship measures which are yet to come. The government really only applies the concept of choice when it suits it. We would like a little bit more systematic attention to the implications of that for individuals, particularly those in need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The implications of this legislation are significant, not only because this legislation is important for all current and future members of SHAR but because at a later date the government will be introducing more general legislation to establish principles for the entire super sector. To the extent that we are establishing a precedent for that more general legislation today, that adds again to the significance of what is before us now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So for all these reasons, and I hope I have explained our position clearly enough, we will&mdash;while not opposing the legislation right now and while supporting the general objectives of it in principle&mdash;nonetheless be referring it to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation for comprehensive analysis and full hearings as to its implications, particularly for low and middle income earners. Our final response to this legislation will depend upon the evidence presented there and the conclusions we reach as a result of that.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will speak briefly on the Small Superannuation Accounts Amendment Bill 1997. As the previous speaker, the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans), summarised, it is a housekeeping matter in terms of the amendments that are made to the Small Superannuation Accounts Act 1995 with regard to the early release of money held in the superannuation holding accounts reserve, otherwise known as SHAR.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments are in line with budget measures of 1997-98, reforming arrangements for the early release of super benefits to members. These reforms will be applied to savings in super funds and RSAs&mdash;that is, retirement savings accounts&mdash;and will be implemented through the amendment of the superannuation industry supervision regulations and the retirement savings account regulations. To ensure complete coverage, the government has extended the reforms to the superannuation holding accounts reserve.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5442">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">SHAR, the superannuation holding accounts reserve, was established to accept super contributions from employers in circumstances where the employer's super fund is not able to accept such small levels of contributions. SHAR is administered by the Commissioner of Taxation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At present, SHAR only permits contributions to be accessed by individual members when the balance is less than $500 and the individual has ceased to be employed by all depositors; the individual is in severe financial hardship; the individual has retired due to a permanent disability; the individual has  turned 65; or the individual is not an Australian resident and is no longer employed in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's reforms restrict the circumstances when moneys can be withdrawn. The $500 threshold will be abolished. The severe hardship test will be replaced by an objective test of hardship based on Commonwealth payments. SHAR will be able to release moneys to a non-resident only after that person reaches the preservation age. These amendments will take effect on 1 July 1997 but will not apply to withdrawal requests lodged with the Commissioner of Taxation before that date. That is a summary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the retirement savings account issue itself, which is an ancillary component of this legislation, I make the general comment that it was with great angst that many people with small superannuation accounts&mdash;particularly in the pastoral industry, shearing industry and a range of the casual work force around regional Australia&mdash;saw these small amounts eroded over the years by the fees and by the administration costs. So it was a great step forward by the government to propose such a reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that many people are appreciative of the fact that lower income earners and those on casual wages were able to at least see these amounts build up into something which was worth while. What was better was that it was not just wasted in fees and just dissipated into nothing. I think also women, who are very much a part of the casual work force, were greatly advantaged by that step forward, by that reform.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Small Superannuation Accounts Amendment Bill 1997 is one of the less contentious pieces of superannuation legislation we have debated in this place in recent times. These proposals seek to alter the principal act in three ways. In the words of one of Perth's leading actuaries, the bill is `simply bringing the superannuation holding accounts reserve, SHAR, into line with other superannuation funds in terms of when people can access their superannuation moneys'. That is good policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But this bill is yet another in a constant stream of legislative changes which are ensuring that our superannuation legislation is becoming as complex and as unmanageable as the tax acts. When I joined the debate on the superannuation surcharge earlier this year, I noted that since July 1994 there has been a legislative change or Insurance and Superannuation Commission release affecting the operation of superannuation funds, on average, every 6.5 days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Notwithstanding other legislation that may be introduced into the House before the next budget, the 1997-98 budget outlines a further seven changes to legislation in the pending financial year. It is little wonder then that Mr Don Mercer, the Chief Executive Officer of the ANZ Bank, described the industry as `muddled' earlier this month. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I'm hoping and hoping that one of these days someone's going to do for superannuation what Wallis has done for the financial system.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Mercer may be hoping for some time. After four years, millions of dollars and countless man&hyphen;hours, the tax law improvement project is yet to yield any real advancement in the simplification of our tax legislation. That does not auger well for a clarification of the superannuation codes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At present there are five instances in which an account holder can access funds held in SHAR. The government is seeking to restrict this access by preventing an individual from withdrawing funds simply because the balance is $500 or less. Also, individuals will no 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5443"> longer be able to draw on their funds in SHAR simply because they are not an Australian resident, unless they are of preservation age. The third change will see a new severe financial hardship clause incorporated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The introduction of award superannuation and the superannuation guarantee scheme, the SGS, were the catalyst for a steady increase in the number of small superannuation accounts in Australia throughout the 1990s so far. The union movement applauded their genesis, asserting that the SGS and award superannuation schemes would ensure that every employee and employer would have access to a member protected superannuation fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the fact that the SGS legislation compelled employers to contribute to a recognised fund on behalf of any employee earning just $449 each month meant that many part-time workers and those who were employed for only a short period became the owners of a superannuation account that housed a very small sum of money. A further complicating factor in the management of these small accounts has been the increase in casual employment in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By and large, employers prefer to make superannuation contributions on behalf of their employees into a single fund. Most are reluctant to make payments to a fund previously utilised by a worker because of the increased expense and complexity it involves. Consequently, many casual and part-time workers now have multiple and unrelated superannuation accounts with small balances. For as long as the public and private sectors continue to demand a more flexible, mobile or casual work force and for as long as our student population, which adds substantially to the casual work force, continues to increase, this situation will proliferate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the concept of superannuation is widely regarded as being a valuable tool for fostering national savings and for providing a retirement income stream for more Australians, small superannuation accounts are often simply not effective. Once entry and exit fees, insurance fees, administrative fees and the tax on contributions are accounted for, there is usually very little left in these smaller ac 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> counts, and what is left evaporates pretty quickly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The superannuation holding accounts reserve became operative under the former Labor administration on 1 July 1995. It was an attempt to deal with the problem. It was originally established to collect superannuation payments on behalf of individuals who contributed less than $1,200 to superannuation for each term of employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Contributions to SHAR have allowed employers to meet their superannuation guarantee obligations without making payments to recognised superannuation funds on behalf of their employees. The superannuation holding accounts were, and continue to be, administered by the Australian Taxation Office, the ATO, which recognises these employer payments as superannuation contributions nevertheless.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some tax experts are concerned by 1 section 14 in this bill, which will see removal of the $500 threshold on SHAR accounts. Those experts argue that the maintenance of accounts of $500 or less is costly to the fund manager and unfair to fund members, who often see their account balance swallowed up by fees. They argue that the government should consider raising the threshold to something like $1,000. This is almost certainly true of recognised superannuation funds, and it is supported by the findings of several independent studies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But this bill will not have any impact on recognised superannuation funds. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business and Investment</EMPHASIS>, in its March 1995 edition, reported that the average industry superannuation fund costs $1 per account per week to run, while each account of a typical large fund costs $1.56 to operate. In the same year, a Senate select committee found that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where the account balance is less than about $750, the net (after tax) annual earnings are likely to be less than the administrative fees and charges, as well as any death and disability insurance premiums applied against the account.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Senate select committee confirmed that this problem was compounded when fund investment returns are low. However, it is important to remember that the SHAR account trust fund was always intended to be a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5444"> `low cost vehicle' for the collection of small superannuation contributions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">SHAR is not a superannuation fund and its accounts have not been subjected to the same prudential standards as have the accounts of recognised funds. SHAR accounts have been, and will remain, shielded from many of the costs involved with maintaining a superannuation account.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The original Small Superannuation Accounts Act 1995 put the onus on the ATO to advise an individual when their SHAR account exceeded $1,200 and to request that the money be transferred into a recognised super annuation fund. This legislation will not alter that arrangement. Individuals who have a SHAR account of less than $1,200 will continue to be immune to the litany of costs involved with managing a superannuation account.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case where this figure of $1,200 is exceeded, individuals should be encouraged to transfer the proceeds into a superannuation account that will see them earn greater returns on their investment. If the government's decision to abolish the $500 threshold results in a greater number of SHAR accounts reaching maturity and being transferred into a complying superannuation fund, then good&hyphen;oh&mdash;it will compel people to become more accountable for providing for themselves in retirement, and should be supported by all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Individuals will continue to have access to their SHAR account if they can prove they are facing severe financial hardship, but the criteria will be modified under 1 section 14 of this proposed legislation. It is intended that Australians who are not yet of preservation age&mdash;that is, below the age of 55&mdash;will have to provide evidence that they have been in receipt of particular Commonwealth income support payments for a continuous period of 52 weeks before their request to access their SHAR account will be considered. Those who are older than preservation age will have to demonstrate that they have been in receipt of income support for a minimum of 39 weeks, or two or more periods that add up to at least 39 weeks.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The explanatory memorandum accompanying this bill states that the new criteria will be an objective test. The clear implication there is that the government regards current practices as not necessarily impartial. If indeed that is the case, then the new method for determining financial hardship is entirely supportable. One of the measures of good tax policy is equity. Although SHAR accounts are technically not superannuation accounts, their sole purpose has been to facilitate an increase in the level of retirement savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is likely that some individuals will find it harder to access their SHAR funds as a result of these measures. However, as one Perth actuary has indicated, this provision `simply tightens up some of the looser conditions of the parent legislation'. If the government is aiming for symmetry between SHAR and superannuation funds, then this is an even-handed approach. If the amendment prevents the erosion of income, as it should, then it is also supportable on that score.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final change proposed by the coalition in the bill, 3 section 14, relates to foreign residents in Australia. This amendment has proven to be more problematic than the changes I have already touched on; one tax expert in Western Australia has gone so far as to label it as outrageous. Non-residents presently are allowed to access their SHAR fund regardless of their age. This legislation proposes to prevent them from doing so until they reach preservation age.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true that this will bring SHAR accounts into alignment with recognised superannuation funds. But this amendment will pose serious hurdles for the many firms who employ non-residents working in Australia. With the increasing globalisation of resources, including human resources, a greater number of employees are now required to travel and work abroad. It does not appear to be fair that, before heading back to their home country, these workers, who may only work in Australia for a short period of time, will not be able to access their superannuation contributions and the contributions they make while in Australia.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5445">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Employees will end up in the unenviable position of having to keep tabs not only on multiple retirement funds but on funds that are scattered throughout more than one country on occasions. This amendment is also likely to create huge administrative difficulties within the ATO. As I have already indicated, the Commissioner of Taxation has a judicial obligation to inform shareholders of a SHAR account if their funds exceed the $1,200 threshold on an annual basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can you imagine the logistical nightmare that will result if the commissioner has to track down individuals who once worked in Australia but have since returned to their country of origin to advise them of the status of their SHAR account? It will be absurd. If this clause is enacted without change, the  government will have to consider negotiating some form of reciprocal arrangement with other governments to allow for the transfer of funds from SHAR into a recognised superannuation account in an employee's home country. I will be interested to hear whether the government has any response to that particular concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was a very real need for the superannuation holding account reserve when it was introduced by the former Labor government in July 1995. Many low income earners and casual workers who were unable to take full advantage of the benefits of superannuation were finally given the opportunity to make some contribution towards their retirement. However, with the enactment of the retirement savings account legislation earlier this year, SHAR no longer has the same relevance in the push for increasing national savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1997-98 budget papers indicate that the government eventually expects SHAR to shut up shop. However, it makes no mention of a definite time frame&mdash;or even a rough one for that matter&mdash;of when this is likely to occur. The coalition stated in budget paper No. 2 that SHAR `has not been able to pay out any moneys in excess of contributions due to high administration costs'. Why then is the ATO not committed to encouraging the transfer of funds from SHAR into retirement savings accounts as of 1 July 1997?</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The immediate transfer of funds would benefit account holders in the form of increased returns and will bring about substantial savings to the taxpayer. The government's suggestion that the ATO will continue to administer the SHAR in the short term is simply not good enough. Interestingly, the financial impact statement in the explanatory memorandum suggests that this bill will have a negligible impact on the budget bottom line. Yet the 1997-98 budget papers tell a very different story.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Page 145 of budget paper No. 2 indicates that the phasing out of SHAR will bring about an estimated saving of almost $25 million over four years. I simply say to the minister responsible and those responsible to him for preparing explanatory memoranda and financial impact statements that, if they cannot get it right and cannot include information which is plainly there in the budget papers, they have a great deal to be worried about in my opinion. It seems rather cavalier to me to dismiss $25 million in savings as a negligible financial impact. What is the point of providing an explanatory memorandum if the information presented in it fails to provide all the relevant details?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Retirement savings accounts are intended to provide a low cost alternative to individuals who are not likely to benefit in full from superannuation. RSAs will be portable and will remain with their owners regardless of for whom or when they work. As with SHAR, holders of retirement savings accounts will be encouraged to roll their savings over into a recognised superannuation fund once the balance exceeds a specified amount.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The introduction of retirement savings accounts and the tightening up of the provisions in the small superannuation accounts are consistent with the government's commitment to increasing the number of people taking full responsibility for their own retirement. As I have said in this place on many  occasions, it is both reasonable and fair to expect people to remain as financially independent as they can for as long as possible.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5446">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the exception of the one matter to which I have referred and about which I have some reservations, this bill brings the superannuation holdings account reserve more into line with recognised superannuation funds and, as such, deserves the support of the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

The measures aim to tighten and streamline arrangements for the early release of superannuation benefits. In doing so, the new arrangements will promote the fundamental retirement income purposes of superannuation without compromising the need for early release in genuinely deserving cases. </PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that the opposition gives general support to this legislation, but the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) raised a question in his address to the House. In relation to his query, the government considers that the new rules are fairer as there will be guidelines to ensure that people in similar circumstances will be treated alike. His concern was in relation to the new tests and in relation to financial hardship. His concern was that the new test was too harsh. There will still be scope for people to access their superannuation benefits on compassionate grounds which will include preventing foreclosure by a mortgagee over a family home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the queries by the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), the new rules for the release will improve conditions for negotiating reciprocal social security arrangements with some countries. His concern was in relation to those people who were temporary residents in our nation. The new test will also significantly reduce the scope for circumventing the early release arrangements by individuals who leave the country and then resume residence not long after obtaining their benefits.</PARA>

Over 100 jobs have been lost in the railways in the last few years under the state Labor Goss government. The level of unemployment in the town, which has a total population of 8,522, as at December 1996 was 951. This will obviously climb now that the Borthwicks Abattoir in the town has permanently closed and there has been a loss of approximately 380 full&hyphen;time positions. There is a high dependency on social security in the town which is a reflection of the very depressed economic circumstances. There are 2,054 people on pensions in the town of Bowen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 14 May, I wrote to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Amanda Vanstone, requesting that Bowen be included in the depressed regions program. This is a very worthy program, implemented in the last budget, which looks at regions which have suffered from major retrenchment activity and heavy loss of employment. Regrettably, the town of Bowen fulfils this requirement. I am looking forward to receiving a response from the minister when the guidelines for this program have been drawn up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I have also approached the Institutional Investor Information Service in order to find other avenues for regenerating the town of Bowen. This is a recent initiative between the Commonwealth and state and territory governments designed to link investors with regional investment opportunities. There is the establishment of a register of investor ready infrastructure projects. I believe that some of these available projects will be appropriate for Bowen to pursue with investors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ideally, if there are projects suitable for the town, the local community, shire council and Regional Development Bureau will have the opportunity to highlight Bowen's attractions to potential investors. The purpose of the IIIS is to promote sustainable regional economic growth through higher levels of investment activity and facilitate greater private invest 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5448"> ment in economic and social infrastructure. The IIIS is predominantly an initiative of the state Minister for Investment and Economics, the Hon. Doug Slack.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of the projects listed on the register have to be assessed by an independent financial analyst and verified as commercially viable before lodgment. The types of projects that appear on the register include transport and communications facilities, social infrastructure, manufacturing plants, production and transmission facilities for electricity, gas and water as well as tourist and environmental facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be other opportunities for Bowen in July when Senator Parer, the Minister for  Resources and Energy, is planning to visit the seat of Dawson for four days. I am very hopeful that he will visit the town of Bowen and look at some of the opportunities for investment and development there. One of those that we have looked at recently&mdash;and we spent a day with the mayor and other leaders of the community in Bowen&mdash;involves the Elliot River channel, which would take part of the Burdekin River irrigation scheme and channel it down through Giru and Gumlu to the town of Bowen. The water from this would open up over 19,000 hectares of farmland to grow sugarcane and various horticultural crops.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As well as that we are looking at opportunities for Urannah Dam, which could potentially open 22 mines in the Collinsville area and create more than 6,096 sustainable full-time jobs. I have written to Howard Hobbs, the Minister for Natural Resources in the state government, and asked him to look at the Elliot River channel proposal particularly as a priority without having to wait for the 18-month Burdekin catchment analysis. Certainly these are a number of the options that are being explored by the shire council, the development bureau and myself to increase investment and job opportunities in the town of Bowen.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="5448"><TITLE><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bringing Them Home</EMPHASIS></TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise this evening to talk about communities&mdash;not in the narrow sense of the word which has become popular in Australia, not communities defined by ethnicity, by lifestyle, political or religious orientation, but all&hyphen;embracing communities, groups of people who give their time and work to community causes which benefit all members of society alike.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What prompts these thoughts is a visit I made to the United Hospital Auxiliaries Illawarra conference last month, in the town of Berry, in my electorate of Gilmore. The 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Berry branch of the UHA is one of many such branches scattered across New South Wales. This non&hyphen;profit organisation was officially established in 1933 to raise funds for hospitals to give both long&hyphen; and short&hyphen;term patients a better environment and better facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Illawarra region of the UHA, with its membership of 377 people, has done more than its fair share of revenue raising for hospitals throughout the region. Since 1926 the organisation has given a total of 494 years of service&mdash;in other words, the equivalent of 500 years of time&mdash;to various activities, with a particular focus on raising funds. In dollar terms, the UHA's 1997 financial statement for my area says a great deal about the commitment of people working for such worthy causes. The Milton&hyphen;Ulladulla branch raised over $45,000;  Greenwell Point, $19,000; Nowra, $31,000; Kiama, $19,000; and the branch I visited last month, Berry, raised over $31,000, with much of the money raised going to assist the Berry hospital.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason why I wish to talk about a sense of community is that none of the UHA members do it because they have to. There are no profits to be made and there is no real gain to be obtained other than the joy of doing something for those in need. This is the type of dedication and generosity I come across time and time again in my electorate. Only a few weeks ago I was given the honour of addressing the changeover dinner at the Bomaderry Lions Club. The committed members of this organisation have raised enough money for a young boy to travel overseas in the hope of finding a medical solution to alleviate the suffering caused by a rare illness. Again, this is a group of people whose endeavours will never be front&hyphen;page news, but whose actions are, in my view, heroic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The work of our local UHAs is of great community importance. Their funds help to pay for wheelchairs, thermometers, phones, scales, therapy equipment, showers, lockers, robes, heart monitors&mdash;everything and anything that is needed in hospitals. The UHAs go about their important tasks in a discreet, unassuming way. They hold raffles, lunch 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5450"> eons, dinners, t&hyphen;shirt sales, sewing sales, sausage sizzles, trivia nights&mdash;anything at all that will help raise funds to support the important work done in hospitals. These are people who work tirelessly to bring about a sense of community, a sense of human beings caring for one another.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mention this for no other reason than to acknowledge the efforts of those who at this moment are working hard to benefit others. These people hold values of decency and kindness that, in spite of everything, are still alive and well in my electorate of Gilmore.  They are people like the Alzheimer's Support Group in my electorate, who for many years now have been extremely active in caring for those affected by this devastating disease. Again, this is a community organisation, run by people who are motivated by generosity alone. They are people who through regular meetings promote a better understanding of Alzheimers and dementia, and offer assistance to those whose loved ones are affected by such debilitating illnesses and who provide a support group for those coping with the trauma and grief of losing loved ones to this condition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are organisations that deserve the support of a caring government. I am pleased to be able to say that the Alzheimer's Association has recently received a federal government grant in recognition of respite for carers and under our aged care policy there will be an extra 30 per cent funding for each and every dementia sufferer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has recognised that more had to be done&mdash;something the previous government failed to support. However, such assistance really tells only part of the story of community organisations. The most important feature of these groups is that they exist as part of a community, part of a wider commitment to the welfare of the people of their towns or regions and, in particular, Gilmore. While always advocating the implementation of government policy that will make a real difference to those in need, I am also of the opinion that we must never lose sight of community based initiatives, of volunteers who work simply to do good, and not because they are receiving government wages.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My support for a well&hyphen;run work for the dole scheme is based on a belief that communities can work for a common goal and could do more if given the chance. I personally have no objection whatsoever to the notion of young, energetic Australians working as part of a broader community, to acquire important skills and to make a contribution to society. Indeed, many unemployed people in my electorate have expressed their willingness to be involved in such community based schemes. In fact, they would consider it a privilege to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My electorate understands that we must return to our values of giving as opposed to receiving, no matter how small the gift, be it in kind or spirit. The people of Gilmore have demonstrated through their work that service groups can bring society together. No matter the beliefs and values that may divide us, a sense of community service will always win out.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="5450"><TITLE><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bringing Them Home</EMPHASIS></TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I wish to detail some of the stories from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bringing them home</EMPHASIS> , the government report detailing the effects of government policy in the past on Aboriginal families and the stolen children. I will start at page 246 with two insights from evidence given to that inquiry. The first is confidential evidence No. 332 from Queensland. This reflects a child's natural approach to their parents and to their memories of the past:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We all adored our mother. She was petite, with long black hair down to her waist. Her skin was soft and chocolate in colour, her big brown velvet eyes were always full of love for all her children. She was a very outgoing caring woman, extremely clean in her home and she kept herself and all we children immaculate in appearance. She was always there for us, her arms wide to comfort us when we were unhappy.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In confidential evidence No. 323 from Tasmania, the time when people are cut off from that parental memory and taken from their homes is nicely encapsulated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Even though at home you might be a bit poor, you mightn't have much on the table, but you know you had your parents that loved you. Then you're thrown into a place. It's like going to another planet. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5451"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Having gone to another planet, having gone through a series of experiences from the positive to the entirely and extremely negative, as I have detailed from throughout the pages of this report&mdash;this reports concentrates on those that are most negative&mdash;one of the things that the report then goes on to deal with is the question of how and in what manner people should be reunited with their families. It recommends that the reuniting should be done on the basis of counselling services being provided to people, because following the trauma of being taken away  from their families many years ago there is also trauma associated with reuniting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In particular, this report outlines the fact that a number of cases came to light where there was no thought, no counselling and no help for the people who had been so disunited and who became, because of that, dysfunctional when they were actually thrown together with their parents. For some, it was a situation that provided great difficulty. I will quote from page 240, which sets out confidential evidence 203, Victoria. This evidence was from a youth who was 15 at the date of the incident, when he had his first meeting with his birth mother. The evidence reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was in one of the cottages [in a juvenile detention centre] and they called me up to the head office and they said, `Your mother's gunna come and visit you this weekend'. And I said, `Who?' and they said, `Your mother'. I said, `Oh yeah, yeah, me mum from Greensborough [foster mother]'. They said, `No&mdash;no, your real mother'. That just tossed me completely. I thought that she&mdash;[foster mother] was my real mother, you know, because I didn't know I was Koori then. I didn't know I was a blackfella. I just thought I was something different&mdash;you know, just dark&mdash;tanned or something. I didn't know. And the day came, you know, and she walked down&mdash;you know. I was at school and I seen them, you know&mdash;me mum and me stepfather. I seen them walking down and I've looked over and then they called me over, you know, and sat down, you know, talked I remember I freaked out a little bit. I didn't know what to say, what to do, you know. And I was hiding behind someone else. You know how when you're&mdash;kids are kids . . . Because you don't know who it is and they say, `Yeah, it's your mum'. How the hell do I know . . . ?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That sense of loss, having been being confronted with his actual birth mother, who he had been cut away from when he was taken away, and then, at the reuniting, not having 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> counselling appropriate to his case, indicates that we need to put more effort into addressing that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Confidential evidence 529 outlines the case of a New South Wales woman who fosters a baby in the early 1970s. Having been rejected at 13 years and returned to her mother by welfare officers, rejection by her mother forced her onto the streets. The evidence reads: </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was out of control. They [foster parents] wanted to get rid of me. So they packed us on a plane, and dumped us at our mother's place, which we'd never really known. And she never knew we were coming. We were just there and she didn't like us. She didn't talk to us for three days. There was just no connection there. Home never became a home.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="5451"><TITLE>Vocational Education: One&hyphen;stop Shop</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to highlight an initiative of the coalition government which has significantly benefited young people in the Deakin electorate. Mr Speaker, I am cognisant of the fact that you, as the member for Casey, and I are beneficiaries of this initiative&mdash;an initiative which has been brought about by the hard working efforts by the minister at the table, the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Melbourne's eastern suburbs are the information technology centre of Australia. In fact, it is one of Australia's fastest growing regional areas. Deakin is a base for hundreds, if not thousands, of small to medium sized businesses. These organisations provide employment opportunities for hundreds of thousands of Australians. Despite the success and growth, it is fair to say that more can be done. I am glad to say that the coalition government is doing more. We are listening to the people of Deakin and working towards opportunities. The coalition is totally committed to maximising vocational education opportunities for young Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I move around the electorate and across Australia with the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, a common complaint by kids and employers is the transition from school to work and the lack of vocational opportunities. A mind&hyphen;set 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5452"> has emerged of `university or bust'. This mind&hyphen;set has enveloped our kids, parents and teachers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of last year's budget, a one&hyphen;stop apprenticeship shop has been established in the heart of Ringwood, servicing the entire eastern suburbs of Melbourne and, in particular, as you would know, Mr Speaker, the areas of the Yarra Valley, which are crucial to Melbourne's growth and which are experiencing high levels of youth unemployment. The shop is centrally located on the Maroondah Highway, close to public transport, an Internet cafe and an ice skating rink. Since its opening by the minister, the facility has operated successfully, providing advice and real assistance to young people wanting to get the most out of life. So far, 400 employers have been contacted, with 102 young people placed in apprenticeships and traineeships.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As members would know, the coalition has put into place new programs and funding to give young Australians the opportunities they deserve&mdash;not merry&hyphen;go&hyphen;round labour market programs on which the opposition and the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) have a fixation. Last month's budget will provide $265 million for more than 100,000 new apprenticeships and traineeships. This funding is part of the $415 million for the new apprenticeship system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As an example of the successful work by the facility at Ringwood, the coalition's apprenticeship one&hyphen;stop shop records, promotes and fills apprenticeship and training vacancies. It processes all approval and registration requirements for apprenticeships and traineeships. It monitors training arrangements, including back&hyphen;up support where necessary and arranges off&hyphen;the&hyphen;job training. The work of the Ringwood location has been complemented by a second site in Mitcham.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will also be complemented by the jobs pathway program. I invite schools in my electorate&mdash;schools like Norwood, Ringwood, Forrest Hill, Heathmont, Blackburn, Mitcham, et cetera&mdash;to consider their involvement in such a program, to consider the rewards that are out there for the students and their fami 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> lies. Facilities at the offices of Jobs East and Business East provide a convenient contact point for schools and businesses to discuss their training requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia now has a national vocational education system&mdash;a system that is more responsive to the training needs of young people and industry alike. It is now much easier and faster to create new apprenticeships and traineeships. This is especially important for the high&hyphen;tech information technology industries based in Melbourne's east where new types of opportunities and new apprenticeships will be created. Due to the focus on outcomes, the process of creating new apprenticeships and traineeships can now occur over weeks instead of months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I congratulate the minister and the state and territory ministers for their achievements; in particular, my state colleague and Minister for Tertiary Education and Training, the Hon. Phil Honeywood, whose electorate is within Deakin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The location of these facilities in the Deakin electorate is a recognition of the hard work and success of organisations like Jobs East, large businesses, educational organisations and group training companies in the area. It is an exciting initiative. It is just one example of the coalition's policies which are benefiting the Deakin community.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising this afternoon to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1997&hyphen;98, I would like to acknowledge that fiscal responsibility is essential if we are to attempt to bring the economy back into balance and reduce our foreign debt. It is one of the most unfortunate elements of the Labor Party's recent 13&hyphen;year tenure in government that this nation was brought to the verge of financial ruin by the Labor Party's policies. These policies were implemented in an environment where arrogance, political correctness and public vilification became standard operating procedures for the Keating regime.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party became distant from the people of Australia and suffered the consequences that it deserved. But what has changed? The Labor Party and its tame lobbyists have continued to operate as if the Labor Party was still in government, attacking anyone who would dare to think that the Keating government's solutions were not the sole legitimate path that this nation should follow into the foreseeable future. As a critic of Keatingism, and all of the unsavoury things that it stood for, I have been publicly attacked by Labor in unison, even though a good percentage of the Labor Party would rather dance on the former Prime Minister's grave than on mine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members of the coalition would do well to consider what is happening. The things I have said have been taken out of context and twisted for simple political gain. Almost every attack on me has also been used as a camouflaged attack on the coalition and especially on the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). What this government needs to do&mdash;and this budget is the most appropriate vehicle&mdash;is to change direction and move away from the proven failure of Keatingism.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5457">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition must recognise the frustration that many people in Australia feel. Even many of those who do not support me recognise that there is something wrong with our political process and with the recent performance of governments. It is not good enough on the one hand to talk about fiscal responsibility and balancing the books whilst on the other allowing government agencies to operate in a way that goes on to waste hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayers' money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My condemnation of the performance of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission is well known. I do not continue these statements against it out of hatred or even dislike for Aboriginal people. Anyone who has listened to what I have had to say will know that I want to abolish ATSIC because it does not work. I accept that there have been some successes that ATSIC has achieved. These have generally been small successes in the areas of cultural and artistic development. I do not wish to demean these achievements but I do ask why Australians have spent billions of dollars on Aboriginal welfare over the past 20 or 30 years to achieve outcomes many of which are worse than before the money was spent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If ATSIC were any other government department, it would have been dragged kicking and screaming into the public eye, where its senior management would have been sacked and public accountability would have been forced. Now, to say that ATSIC should in some way perform to public expectations on expenditure of public money becomes a racist act. What better way to hide the poor performance of ministers, public servants and members of ATSIC?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that there has been such an enormous waste of taxpayers' money that the public need to know what has happened. They also need to know the extent to which government, especially the Labor government, has been involved in this waste through inaction. To this end, I call upon this government to immediately set up a royal commission into the operations of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. I would like to see such a royal commission investigate all aspects of Aboriginal welfare and funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Calling for such a royal commission is not a racist act, though I am sure it will be reported as such by the time I finish this speech. What I want to see is an investigation to let us know what has been going on so that we can fix it. Aboriginal people and the broader Australian population deserve it. Unless we fix the way that ATSIC operates we will never see any improvement in the welfare of Aboriginal people. They will never get the support from government that they deserve as Australian citizens unless government shows the courage to treat Aborigines in the same way as it treats other Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Aboriginal health is the best example of how a policy of deliberate affirmative action without responsibility has failed. It has been estimated that Australian governments have poured over $30 billion of taxpayers' funds into the Aboriginal industry since the late 1960s. Of that, $69.7 million was spent on Aboriginal health in 1994 alone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even one of my critics, the Governor&hyphen;General, has reported that health outcomes in many aspects are now worse than before the money was spent. How can that be? Where has the money gone? What mistakes are we making? How can we stop making these mistakes? What should we be doing instead so that we can improve the welfare of Aboriginal people? Surely these are all realistic questions that need answers. I believe that the political correctness that now passes for debate in this country has taken such a hold that a royal commission is perhaps the only way that we will get to the bottom of this issue.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5458">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But there are more aspects that need investigation than Aboriginal health. The New South Wales government's Independent Commission Against Corruption inquiry into the New South Wales Land Council has shown that over a period of many years there has been systematic incompetence, lack of accountability and evidence of substantial fraud related to Aboriginal funding. The vast majority of Aboriginal people who this money was meant for have never seen, and will never see, any benefits from it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whose fault is it? Was it the fault of the people who wasted the money, or of the governments who refused to put in place the proper kinds of measures to safeguard the interests of the Aborigines this money was to go to? Who are the real racists here: the people who claim that what has been happening is wrong or those who want to perpetuate it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many people in the Aboriginal community are just as frustrated with what is happening. Sharon Firebrace has called for a royal commission because something has to be done to stop certain leaders and factions betraying their own people. A royal commission is necessary to determine the full extent of mismanagement of services to the Aboriginal community. Beatrice Faust says that giving money to ATSIC is like carrying water in a basket.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Aboriginal defence against greater accountability is typified by something said by Lois O'Donohue: `I ask why indigenous Australians never need to be more accountable than anyone else, for comparatively small amounts of money.' This is one of the people who have accused me of being out of touch with reality. It is demonstrably clear to anyone who will keep an open mind that in fact the standards of accountability are lower for Aboriginal people. The truth is that they should not be. We do not want an Uncle Tom mentality and not require transparency and accountability. Aborigines must take responsibility&mdash;but anyone who, like me, has stood up and insisted on equal treatment and on greater accountability is accused of racism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like the rest of the Australian community, Aborigines want their representatives to listen and act in the best interests of their constituents. We here in parliament know of the public's obsession with parliamentary travel expenses and accusations of travel rorts which have filled the press in recent times. We have determined that we need to be subject to special accountability to ensure that the taxpayer has a transparent view of how we spend the money given to us for these purposes, but what about ATSIC commissioners? They are paid far more than members and senators, they represent a much smaller and less diverse constituency, and yet we are not to ensure that they are also accountable for their travel expenses. We really have to get serious about this. As honourable members know, I believe that all Australians need to be treated equally. We cannot continue to fund an organisation which does not achieve the objectives for which it was set up and seeks to divide our nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second aspect of my speech that I want to cover today deals with native title and Wik. I was born in this country and am proud to be an Australian. I do not like to be accused of being responsible for things that were done by other people. I was not responsible for the stolen generation, although I am genuinely sorry for those who have suffered. I know that these things did happen, but I cannot apologise to those people on behalf of others because I have no right to. I believe that it would simply add to the politicising of an issue which has been deliberately manipulated by a minority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also sorry for those Aborigines who have lost access to traditional lands since colonisation, but I am opposed to any move by an intellectual elite to turn this country upside 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5459"> down by giving Australia back to the Aborigines. Clarrie Isaacs, who is one of my Aboriginal critics in Western Australia, actually proposes handing back 100 per cent of this country to an Aboriginal government and then having the rest of us lease it back under a crown land lease arrangement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently, we have seen Aboriginal claims on more than just the land. Fishing rights in Australia are also under threat. Claims now extend over significant parts of the sea. In August last year an Elcho Islander, Mr Terry Yumbulul, said that because white Australia has been responsible for 150 years of scraping and fishing on the bottom of the sea, we should pay compensation for the loss of fish. There are 150 claims involving water&mdash;60 in Western Australia and 30 in Queensland. Who is going to pay to defend the rights of the fishing industry, and what will the effect of these claims be on investment in one of Australia's premier export industries?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am criticised for speaking out because it is alleged I am affecting Australia's trade, an allegation made up in the minds of Australia's two great representatives, Tim Fischer and Alexander Downer. Here is another example of how Mabo and native title are destroying prospects for Australian jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another area that I wish to talk on today is the child support scheme. The child support scheme has become a very unworkable scheme. Children are being used as pawns in an often bitter and unpleasant experience which often results in the non-custodial parent being left angry and frustrated by what appears to be an arbitrary and unjust system. Those who perceive themselves as losers in the process sometimes become suicidal, depressive and vindictive. It is no coincidence that some have turned to murder or other forms of violence as a consequence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the other hand, some custodial parents are left with the full financial burden of raising the children of the relationship with little or no help from non&hyphen;custodial parents. In many cases, non&hyphen;custodial parents will throw in their jobs and go onto welfare to avoid paying excessive maintenance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to see the use of net wages as the basis for the calculation of child support to make the system fairer and more likely to be honoured by non&hyphen;custodial parents. Custodial parents can earn up to $42,000 before maintenance calculations are affected. If they are living in a de facto relationship, the partner's income is not taken into account. This is grossly unfair. In many instances, the maintenance&hyphen;paying parent is living in virtual poverty, while the custodial parent can afford to have a relatively higher standard of living. This was not the intent of the process in the first place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Non&hyphen;custodial parents' wages should only be calculated on a normal working week's pay, without overtime or penalty payments being taken into consideration. If non&hyphen;custodial parents choose to have a second job, this also should not be taken into account. There should be an incentive for non&hyphen;custodial parents to feel able to reorganise their lives to take their new circumstances into account. Maintenance should not be a ticket to poverty for non&hyphen;custodial parents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ironically, those who do the right thing are virtually punished for their troubles, while those who walk away from their responsibilities seem to get away with it. When kids spend school holidays with non&hyphen;custodial parents, unfortunately the effect is that the parents end up paying 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5460"> twice because they not only pay to feed, clothe and nurture their children directly, but they are also still paying maintenance to the other parent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is impossible to devise a fair scheme which relies on the judgment of officers of the department who are overworked, unsympathetic and, in many cases, burnt out by the sheer volume and nature of the inquiries they are handling. This means many parents are treated in an arbitrary way which puts them under unnecessary stress and makes a difficult situation even worse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How can you honestly expect officers under these conditions to respond in a way that can soothe the anger and frustration of parents in the system? The Australian Family Court should show more support for joint custodial arrangements because, according to research by Professor William Bender of Georgia University, children adjust much better to divorce when they are cared for in joint custody.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are over 400,000 non&hyphen;custodial parents in the community. The government must take action and not leave the child support system in the too hard basket. The government should have a good look into the child support scheme because a lot of parents&mdash;custodial parents and non&hyphen;custodial parents&mdash;are hurting. The government must take a good look at the system.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I recommence my speech proper, the first three seconds of which were absolutely brilliant, it would be remiss of me not to comment on the last point made by the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) regarding the Child Support Agency. I could comment on a number of the things she said here today, but I will not take the opportunity. In regard to the Child Support Agency, the government has had a backbench subcommittee set up for the past six months, and we have reported to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). We have already stated in the press that the government, the Prime Minister and the cabinet have made a commitment to address this problem on the Prime Minister's return from overseas and that we will endeavour, to the best of our ability, given the time constraints and the amount of legislation to go through the parliament, to have the legislation reforming the Child Support Agency come into the parliament before the end of this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would hate to think that the member for Oxley is being an opportunist in trying, once again, to ride on the back of the fine work that has been done by the government. She tends to take credit for everything that others do and, in the meantime, merely puts up what are, in many cases, false arguments of her own. I must say, though, that some of the points she raised today are very accurate. There is obviously a lot of discontent and concern with the Child Support Agency. But, unlike the member for Oxley, this government is actually addressing the problem for the betterment of the people concerned, and particularly the children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My purpose in rising today is to talk about the Australian inland rail expressway. Australia is a wonderful country which has many great assets: our weather, our open and clean environment, and the many rights that we enjoy here. When foreigners come to Australia, either for tourism or any other purpose, they are often struck by the enormous distances that they are faced with in travelling from one place to another. We take it in our stride, but the reality is that, for every plus that we have in being such a large, open nation, we also have the negative of the great distance and, therefore, the cost of transport of our goods and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5461"> services, both to our domestic and export markets. It takes both time and money for Australia even to get its exports to the ports before they leave our shores bound for overseas markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian inland rail is not a new idea and I certainly cannot claim it as my own. I believe it was Ben Chifley's government that first said that we did not have the money as a nation to go ahead with this project. That was after World War II, when it was decided it was needed for defence. I think that particular reason has not changed to this day. With us moving more of our troops to the north, we realise that our roads are already at capacity and that if we do not control the seaways in any time of conflict, how do we resupply ourselves? Aircraft is not the answer, given the great distances and the amount of goods that would be required to sustain any effort in the unfortunate event of us being attacked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More immediately, we have a concern as a nation that we have export earnings being wasted because we are not competitive. There are many reasons for that, but the one that I want to focus on today is our transport cost. In my electorate, the Lockyer Valley is a small crops area where we have the potential to be part of the supermarket to Asia program, which can realise $2 billion worth of exports for Australia. Unfortunately, the cost of actually getting that product to the Asian markets in time for it to be used in a fresh state is so prohibitive that it makes that very difficult. There are some advances there. But the Australian inland rail express&mdash;which will be running from Darwin, down through Mount Isa, through central Queensland, west of the Great Divide, through the Riverina of New South Wales and finally into Victoria&mdash;can for the first time open up the west of the Great Divide and the great basin of inland Australia, which has such enormous potential.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For one example, in the mineral industry, look at Mt Isa Mines. For this company, it costs four times as much to move ore from the Mount Isa mine to the port at Townsville as it does to move their ore a comparable distance from their mines in South America. It is actually quicker and cheaper for them to use road than rail here. That is an appalling state, where we are compromising our opportunities as an export nation because of the inefficiency of our rail system and our transport system. Furthermore, by having so many trucks on the road, we do enormous damage to our infrastructure. We have also seen many fatal accidents as a result of fatigued truck drivers working incredibly long hours simply to keep Australia on the move.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This particular rail project is very visionary. It is estimated to cost somewhere in the vicinity of $10 billion. But the reason I am attracted to it is because they are not, as a consortium, asking for any federal or state government funding. I think that has been one of the reasons, from the time of Chifley, that this project has not gone ahead, because there has always been a great demand for federal and state funding. We have seen AN and its current demise. I guess that proves beyond any shadow of a doubt that governments are not the best people to run rail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But this project we are talking about is not a conventional railway. We are talking about a railway line that can move heavy exports, heavy freight, from Melbourne to Darwin at over 160 kilometres an hour, with trains over a kilometre long. You can imagine the number of trucks that would be required to be able to move the same amount of freight. Light freight, such as fruit and vegetables, can be moved at something in the vicinity of 250 kilometres per hour. This will ensure that we can get our products to the port of Darwin, a large deepwater port which can facilitate exports to our near northern neighbours, so that we can get fresh fruit, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5462"> vegetables and other produce, as well as the myriad of other exports, onto the shelves very quickly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A few of the other benefits of this project are that we will no longer be required to tie up our southern ports to the same degree. Currently, we have many of our imports and exports travelling via the Great Barrier Reef&mdash;and we all know the dangers should there be a spill of some consequence. I believe that it is only a matter of time before something disastrous occurs on the reef, to the detriment of us all. So if we can remove that potential for damage from the reef, that is yet another benefit that this project can have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are also other benefits to Australia. Rather than just looking at the straight exporting of our beef, our wool and our grains, et cetera, we should also look at what has happened to the west of the Great Divide over the last 50 years. My grandparents moved from Charleville with my mother and her brother and sister approximately 50 years ago. I think it was about that time, at the end of the Second World War, when we first saw the demise of so many of these country towns; towns that were set up because of the distances in Australia. The towns were there to support the sheep stations and the cattle properties around them. But now, with the advent of very fast air travel, many property owners travel to other places to do their shopping. In Queensland they travel into Toowoomba to do their shopping. They bypass the country towns, and the very purpose of the existence of the towns no longer exists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You cannot make an artificial reason for having these towns&mdash;you cannot manufacture a reason. There has to be a purpose for them. I believe that the inland rail will provide that purpose. It will encourage business to relocate to these areas&mdash;whether it be Dubbo or Parkes or Deniliquin or anywhere else on the Queensland route&mdash;so that they can take advantage of the open spaces, the obviously cheaper land and the very quick access to foreign ports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have made a promise to my whip and, being good to my word, I will keep my speech to about 10 minutes duration today due to the constraints of time. I want the House to appreciate that this is not a pipedream. People have looked at numerous projects over the years and decided that they were just too big and too unachievable. This is not just achievable; it will occur. I believe it will occur through the enterprise of private business, and that it will be running within the next decade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tomorrow I am attending a meeting in Sydney when a formal board will be set up and a company established. I am pleased to be able to announce that tomorrow should see KPMG begin the first revenue study to identify who can actually utilise this railway. This is a high risk venture, but I believe it will be the turning point in Australia's history. History will record its creation as the moment when Australia became a great nation and when we fulfilled our complete and total potential rather than the partial potential which we have been attempting to reach over the last two to three decades.</PARA></SPEECH>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5463"> more than now appears to be the case. He clarified, I have got to admit, a few days ago that the money will only be utilised in New Guinea.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have got to make a dreadful apology. Whilst commending this initiative&mdash;and, as he well knows, I have written to him about war cemeteries overseas&mdash;I made the comment that the money devoted by the current government to the improvement of war cemeteries was perhaps the greatest job creation program in this budget, and that it was ironic that the jobs would be created overseas rather than in western Sydney. He is correct in saying the jobs will be created in Papua New Guinea and not in Malaysia, and I apologise for that error on my part. But I think the minister should perhaps fully concentrate on the crucial matters in this budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not disputing for one moment that commemoration is a crucial aspect of the portfolio, but bread and circuses are not the entire portfolio. Commemoration, war memorials and all these things which we all support and which have had bipartisan endorsement in this country for decades will not confuse the veterans of this country in regards to more fundamental challenges to their conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note that many speeches these days by the minister seem, for some strange reason, to be totally preoccupied with this aspect of the budget. I want to say here today that there are deeper concerns with this portfolio than the questions of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Paradise Road</EMPHASIS> and how many presentations of cheques he is going to make around the country. I want to cover some aspects of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In regard to the overall DVA resources, the average staff numbers for the Veterans' Affairs portfolio for the 1997&hyphen;98 financial year will be cut by 610&mdash;from 3,400 down to 2,796. This includes a loss of 275 positions as a direct result of the government's imposition of an efficiency dividend for the portfolio of 14.3 per cent over three years. That is the first fact of life, far more important than any attempt to go on SBS television. The fact of life is that this portfolio, which the RSL, other service groups in this country and both parties have consistently endorsed, is now going to be subject to very significant downsizing. The fact of a separate department providing this service has been a position that all parties have traditionally endorsed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The secretary to the department, Dr Johnston, told the Senate estimates hearing on 12 June that, due to the combined effect of a number of changes instituted by the government, DVA staffing could be reduced by up to 30 per cent over the next three years. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> on page 329, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We need to identify areas where we can contract out some of our business . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is impossible to believe that cuts of this magnitude can be made without seriously reducing the level, quality, extent and timeliness of service to veterans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also know that the government has followed through with its predecessor's mortality study of Vietnam veterans. That showed suicide rates 21 per cent greater than in the comparative Australian population, an overall mortality rate seven per cent greater and a cancer rate of 21 per cent. There has been a follow&hyphen;up study.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This side of the House remains concerned that 1,805 veterans out there are not part of that study, have not been identified and are not part of the input. We join with the government in asking the veterans to make sure they do respond to this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When he released the report, the minister promised:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5464">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The federal government will implement a comprehensive program of health research, education and counselling to supplement existing benefits and services available to Vietnam veterans.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Now we discover, based on answers from the secretary to DVA, Dr Johnston, to questions from Labor senators at last week's Senate estimates hearings, that no additional budgetary resources have been allocated to follow up the findings. It was bad enough stuffing up the returns and causing a great degree of furore out there amongst these veterans by putting a gun at their head and telling them they had to get the returns back in a week or two. I am glad to see that he has rescinded that and actually given them a longer period to respond.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The secretary to the department said on the record that there will be no additional budgetary resources for the follow&hyphen;up to the findings. That was on 12 June. It is on page  349 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. It is difficult to believe that the minister is truly intending to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . supplement existing benefits and services&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">when he has allocated not one additional dollar to do so, and the department itself is facing significant downsizing and looking at contracting out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, the government has been loudly proclaiming its intention to provide a vocational rehabilitation scheme for younger ex&hyphen;service men and women. The idea behind it is quite worthy, quite commendable. However, at the same time, as part of the coalition's overall public service cutbacks implemented in recent legislation, they have cut the number of staff at the Vietnam Veterans' Counselling Service from 152 to 137. This is the very body that is central to the government's rehabilitation scheme. This means the service has to be taken as a new priority initiative with 15 fewer staff than they had in 1996&hyphen;97 to deal with a regular workload.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have on previous occasions&mdash;and I am not the only person to raise this; the RSL has taken it up in recent weeks&mdash;had concerns about other aspects of this budget and its predecessor that are very much affecting veterans. It is all right for the minister to go around the country and say that he is not regarding the gold card as being in the too hard basket. The fact of life is: when Costello's got anything to say in this government&mdash;and I think he has a bit more to say than the minister&mdash;there is not going to be any change in the gold card. He knows it as well as I do. To start saying that he is in there fighting for them is really just totally irrelevant to the overall debate on what has happened in this last budget in regard to pharmaceuticals, what is happening in aged care and what is occurring around a broad frame of aged care as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we do see, as I have indicated in other speeches, is savings of nearly $33 million over the next four years through the introduction from February 1998 of therapeutic goods premiums whereby veterans will have to pay the difference between higher price drugs within the group and the base price set. Another saving of $6 million over four years will come from the delisting in February 1998 of medicines for so&hyphen;called less serious medical conditions including antifungal and antidiarrhoea items.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The budget for this portfolio is going to be slashed by $40 million over the next years. It is all right to keep talking about how many canons he has patted on the back, and how many medals he has given out, and how many cheques he has handed over, et cetera. That is all very commendable but he does not have a position out there. People do not perceive that he is out there fighting on these more fundamental issues that affect the daily lives of aged veterans in this country.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5465">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also interesting to note that there will be savings of nearly $10 million over four years on the service pension outlays due to the introduction in July 1998 of a bonus plan to encourage eligible individuals to defer for up to five years applying for the pension. There are concerns that the veterans' affairs element of the plan is likely to focus on Vietnam veterans, who were shown in the recent Vietnam mortality study to have above average levels of mortality, particularly from cancer and suicide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, there is a variety of concerns. I have also had a number of approaches from Vietnam veterans' organisations&mdash;and others, to be honest&mdash;about the new panel diagnosis for certain conditions. Once again, the reality is that this is going to occur under the pretext that all of these veterans are supposedly cheating the government. These are people who have essentially given their service in very difficult circumstances, under fire, many of them. We have this allegation by this government, and I hear the departmental figures to groups that they have had discussions with that 5 per cent of them they regard as rorters. We are going to have this new attempt, particularly with regard to PTSD, basically to ensure that certain psychiatrist's medicals are not worth the paper that they are written on, to try to make it difficult for people to get through the process, difficult to win.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another matter that veterans organisations have taken up with me is legal aid. I admit that some of these changes are not directly related to the minister's portfolio but we have a situation where veterans are concerned about things such as panel diagnosis and possible changes to tribunals. At the same time, this government, under the pretext of difficult arrangements and confusion between state and federal powers with regard to legal aid, and whether 5c too much was spent on a state matter, is dramatically slashing access to legal aid in this country. Some of the people that will be crucially hit will be veterans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are the more fundamental issues of concern to the veterans of this country. These are issues that are more important to their livelihood, to their families. These are issues that are more important to their widows than some of the aspects that the minister seems to believe are worthwhile diversions from the fundamental issues. We know that the widows of war veterans are going to be hit very hard in the area of aged care, and there is some speculation as to the charge that is going to be introduced. There have been estimates of an average of $80,000. Those estimates are not from the Labor Party shadow minister. They are not from the ACTU or any of the other so&hyphen;called bogey men out there; they are from the industry that will be gaining this money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously, those people who are paying that kind of figure are being forced to sell their house under pressure from this government. That is because Mr Costello's National Commission of Audit report says that there are too many asset&hyphen;rich people out there avoiding responsibility for aged care. The veteran community in this country thinks that the minister's hard end should be going to such matters as the death tax. That is what he should be combating. He should be fighting for those sorts of matters and not worrying about the peripheral bread and circus diversions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A subject of recent months has been this toing&hyphen;and&hyphen;froing over the recognition of overseas medals. This fits in with the question of the credibility of the government. We had the former shadow minister, Mr Tuckey, running around every possible RSL conference that he could get a leg in, for a year or two beforehand, saying that he did not care if people got imperial honours, that he was going to be in there as soon as he got his seat on the cabinet benches getting them another award because they deserve `a distinctly Australian award'. It is quite 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5466"> obvious that he knew that they were already receiving an imperial award and he was saying they should get a second one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very pleased to see the level of discontent and the level of criticism in the newspaper columns in this country, both from individuals who have had their heads kicked in over this issue and from a variety of service groups, with the last&hyphen;minute excuse by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop). They have suddenly found this new capital offence called double medalling. This is a very serious matter, this double medalling, despite the fact that the predecessor had made it emphatically clear that he was aware of it and he was saying there should be a second medal. The minister herself of course went around the RSL national conference saying that she was still there with Wilson Tuckey and she had the same policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 23 September 1996, the minister issued a press release at the national conference saying, `I am pleased to announce that the government's policy is largely in place, with the Governor&hyphen;General having already approved changes to the determinations for the medals under his authority and Her Majesty's consent is being sought for other changes.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Subsequently, the minister was forced to admit in question time on 28 May 1997 that the coalition would not honour this commitment to those who served in the Korean war, the Malayan emergency and the Indonesian confrontation. Eight months after she had said everything was on track, that all the necessary approvals were in train and after thousands of applications had been received, the minister pleaded that, `It was indeed then discovered that those people had been awarded an imperial medal at the behest of the Australian government and therefore it was an Australian medal rendered in respect of that active service in Korea, in the Malayan emergency and in the Indonesian confrontation. Accordingly, the government made a decision that that would represent double medalling and that that would not be done.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A fortnight later it looks like there is going to be another backflip because a significant number of opposition backbenchers are a bit embarrassed around the place. They are getting a bit of heat. They are getting a few phone calls and of course in the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald&hyphen;Sun</EMPHASIS> of 11 June we see a little leak there that the government would announce a medals about&hyphen;turn in two weeks time. Once again, there is a question of the degree of honesty in this government and the degree of belief in what they are saying.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to return to the point on which I originally had trouble with the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. That is the question of employment in this country. I note at the outset that I have to quote these figures from June 1996 because the government is incapable, in response to a question on notice from myself, of giving me any updated figures. I want to say to this minister that whilst it is commendable that we actually do honour the dead and we do recognise those who died overseas for this country, I still say very clearly that unemployment in this country and particularly in western Sydney is fairly important. Quite frankly, it is a major indictment of this government that the only job creation scheme they did come up with in the last budget was in fact this thing for war graves overseas. I wish they had many other schemes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The figures of June 1996 show that in Auburn municipality there is unemployment of 19.4 per cent, Holroyd 9.9 per cent and Parramatta 10.5 per cent. There are a few qualifications in the minister's answer on that question. He says, `They are not exact and accordingly should be read with caution.' They are `subject to greater variability', et cetera. All of the quibbling, all of the prevarication and all of the qualifications in the world do not take away from this 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5467"> government's slashing of labour market programs by $1.8 billion in the previous budget. It does not get away from the fact that this government, unlike its predecessor, does not have a target like Labor did of five per cent unemployment. For all of the attempt by the Prime Minister to talk about average figures over the years of Labor government, it can not escape the fact that in the first 15 months of the Labor government, unemployment in this country went down from 10 per cent to 8.9 per cent. In contrast in the same period of time the Howard government has managed to drive it upwards to 8.8 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the Prime Minister said, and I very rarely agree with his comments, on television last week, `The government in power is seen as responsible for this'.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More than ever, if there is a government around the place that is responsible for unemployment, it is this one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have seen is a slashing of labour market programs by $1.8 billion. That is in contrast to its predecessor's very graphic lifting of expenditure on active labour market programs. It had not been a trend previously in this country to be preoccupied with active programs, but Labor did that. They lifted it from 0.27 per cent of GDP to 0.73 per cent by 1994&hyphen;95. But what we have seen from this government is a tax on export market development grants; a tax on research and development assistance; a tax on DIFF; a tax on bounties; and a tax on every possible assistance to industry in regard to unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has slashed labour market programs. They have slashed a variety of positions for young people, and they are now coming out with the concept of amalgamating the CES and other government instrumentalities into so&hyphen;called one&hyphen;stop shop agencies. Last week, we had the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on TV saying that small business, and even the prospective employees, can pay $250. I want to quote a constituent of mine, Miss Alarna Tufrey of Merrylands. She wrote:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the coalition government's second budget, in Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1997&hyphen;98. Before I commence, I will make a couple of passing comments in answer to those that have just been made by the member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson). I note that most of his address was directed towards the issue of veterans' affairs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would say, in defence of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Scott), what a splendid job he has done in the past 16 to 17 months. Without the fanfare of Australia Remembers marking 50 years, he has diligently applied himself to the task at hand. `Their Service&mdash;Our Heritage' has gone down as an excellent program in the electorate. I do note, though, the member for Reid's comments about the gold card, and the anticipation that is out there amongst some of the veterans. If we can deal with some of the remaining issues that have been cropping up in more recent times with regard to the Vietnam veterans, I am certainly totally supportive of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My principal comment in regard to the member for Reid is in terms of his claim about Labor's record on unemployment. The fact which has been neglected in all of this is that the average rate of unemployment that Labor had from 1990 to 1996 was&mdash;and despite all of the claims that they make&mdash;somewhere around 8.6 per cent: that was their average, their unemployment record. They can stand here and talk about the Howard government's record&mdash;or lack of record, to use their words&mdash;in terms of unemployment. But, after 15 months of economic reform, as compared with their 13 years, we certainly can hold our heads up high.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have managed to bring down this budget without increasing taxes. This should never be forgotten by those on the other side, and I know that the Australian public in turn also acknowledges this point. There are no increases in petrol tax, there are no increases in personal tax and there is no increase in the Medicare tax. This is a budget which has consolidated the efforts of the budget that was brought down last year in August. It delivers ongoing policy consistency and it delivers certainty for all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More particularly, the budget confirms our solid commitment to the needs and aspirations of ordinary Australians: those working men and women, their families, the aged pensioners and the self&hyphen;funded retirees&mdash;the very people who make up my electorate of Deakin. Through this budget the Howard government has reaffirmed its credentials as a responsible economic manager. It is a government that is willing to tackle the longer term structural reforms so desperately needed. In stark contrast to our approach, we have Labor's policy of inconsistencies and reversals. By jettisoning past policies, the opposition have shown themselves for what they really are&mdash;political opportunists.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5469">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In an international comparative sense, many Australians may not realise the abundant opportunities that are available here in this country. In contrast to those looking to the politics of blame and for scapegoats&mdash;and we have seen a few of those in this House&mdash;I would like to highlight the fact that Australia continues to be a great place to live and work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently I had the good fortune to travel to Taiwan. The message I brought home from this trip was that the quality of Australian products and services should never be underestimated and should never be talked down, particularly by members of this federal parliament. They are as good as those anywhere else in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition's approach to government is to prepare the way for a strong, vibrant, cohesive society&mdash;a society that can more than match it with the tiger economies to our north. This massive task is ongoing, and I am glad to say that the report card to this point in time is quite favourable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald&hyphen;Sun</EMPHASIS> newspaper in my city of Melbourne said on 14 May:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Peter Costello has decisively buried the Keating legacy&mdash;in more ways than one. It very clearly establishes his fiscal and economic and political . . . credentials. It consolidates our nation's finances around a small government dynamic.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Of course, it is not only Peter Costello who has decisively buried the Keating legacy, but the Australian Labor Party has also decisively buried the Keating legacy and, as I say, jettisoned its previous policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The days of debt and deficit spending are over. Labor's approach gave us, as a nation, an increase in government debt of billions of dollars. The reality of a less than responsible budgetary approach is that financial problems only get worse. As every mortgagee knows, paying interest on interest already accrued will over time become very costly. The longer the debt is not responsibly managed, the larger it grows. A downward spiral of deficit and debt leads to a feeling of frustration, hopelessness and finally desperation as one loses control.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The public knows our nation was heading down this path. They demanded responsible economic management, and the Commonwealth has responded by ensuring that the budget is balanced across the economic cycle. Two excellent and very responsible budgets have been brought down by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and by the Howard government. Unfortunately, this simple principle was lost on Labor. Despite economic growth, their budget was in deficit&mdash;year after year their budgets were in deficit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Through this budget, the coalition has placed Australia on the path to increased savings. Governments and companies, as well as individuals, need to be encouraged to put aside more financial resources. Through increased savings, our reliance on foreign borrowings can be drastically reduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bottom line with increased savings is faster economic growth and, importantly, jobs. These two budgets have been all about jobs. There has been a multi&hyphen;dimensional attack on the issue of jobs, not the one dimensional attack that Labor employed of simply pouring money into labour market programs. Nobody knows better the waste of the labour market programs than me. I was one of the subcontractors who had to stand at the front of a room and deliver a message of hope and possible success once the two weeks, six weeks or eight weeks was over. It was hard to take. It was hard to have to look into the faces of the young kids, the retirees and those who were retrenched later in life knowing that, when they walked out of the room, Labor was not offering another job; Labor was simply offering another training program. This budget is a multi&hyphen;dimensional attack, and we will succeed. As I said before, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5470"> I am pleased to say that, after 15 months, the budget report card is quite favourable and getting better by the month.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For its part, the coalition has set a good savings example. This budget predicts that the Commonwealth budget will be in surplus over three years. We have gone from a $10.5 billion deficit to a $1.6 billion surplus. Most importantly, this position has been achieved in a just and fair manner. All sectors of society have contributed, which is in contrast to the ideology driven, high spending `tax the rich' New South Wales Labor budget. The New South Wales budget is a reminder at state and federal level that Labor's old taxing and spending habits do die hard. This budget makes it easier for individuals to save.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All taxpayers in the Deakin electorate will be eligible for a 15 per cent tax rebate. Once the scheme is fully implemented, the rebate will apply to the first $3,000 of taxable income from savings, whatever the source, be it bank interest, superannuation contributions or dividend income. The maximum rebate of $450 will accrue on $3,000 worth of savings. Put another way, that is a $450 tax cut. Around six million people will benefit from this incentive scheme, and most benefit will go to those with taxable incomes under $40,000. In my electorate this represents approximately 45 per cent of households. They will receive the maximum benefit of $450. For those paying a 20c marginal rate, the rebate scheme offers a 15 per cent tax cut for every dollar of savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why is it that the most positive and beneficial policies attract the most strident criticism&mdash;criticism that is misinformed and misleading? Scare campaigns and misinformation, now characteristic of this opposition, are not appreciated by the average citizen. My constituents tell me they do not appreciate the ALP playing political games with their lives and the futures of their families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I pose the question: would all Australians potentially benefit from Labor's l&hyphen;a&hyphen;w tax promises as they benefit from this government's savings plan? The answer, of course, is no. But it gets worse for the opposition. On national TV the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans) said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I'm talking about the abandonment of the superannuation co&hyphen;contribution, in favour of a little windfall tax break for those who don't need or deserve it.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I will throw those words back at the member for Holt at an appropriate time. He has added another beauty to the ALP's quotable quotes list, and demonstrates once again Labor's `we know what is best for you' uncaring attitude. It is obvious from that comment that Labor thinks the self&hyphen;funded retirees of Deakin do not need or deserve a tax rebate on their hardearned savings. I take issue with that comment and the opposition's suggestion, and I am sure that the good citizens of Deakin think the same way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There certainly are quite a lot of other areas I could tackle but, in line with our time commitments made for this debate, I would say in conclusion that the coalition government is committed to doing the right thing by all Australians. This budget continues the strategy of repairing the mess left by Labor. It will also bring certainty, economic security and, above all, a climate for increased employment. I congratulate the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) for their responsible solutions to Labor's 13 years of neglect.</PARA></SPEECH>

While I do not agree with everything that Saul says in the book, I was particularly taken by some of his remarks, one of which I would like to quote here. Saul says at the beginning of his book:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a general sense that our civilisation is in a long&hyphen;term crisis. It can been seen from the political, social or economic aspect. From each angle, the same crisis can be seen differently. I would like to argue that it took on its actual economic form in 1973, when a first wave of political crises lead to an oil supply crisis. We have been in a depression ever since. It does not resemble a 1929&hyphen;style depression, but then depressions have always been different, one from the other. Ours has been softened and evened out thanks to the life preservers gradually put in place by society after 1929 in order to give us more time to manoeuvre and act should a disaster repeat itself. It did, in 1973. Now, given our inability over the past two decades to deal with an unbreakable chain of unemployment, debt, inflation and no real growth, we have drifted farther and farther out into a cold, unfriendly, confusing sea. The new certitude of those in positions of authority&mdash;those out of the water&mdash;is that the certain answer is to cut away the life preservers. This might be called a childlike act. Or one of unconsciousness so profound as to constitute stupidity.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Of course, I believe that the changes in this budget fit Saul's description and, without doubt, constitute stupidity. In particular, the government's failure to put in place mechanisms to stimulate the economy and thereby create employment is a prime example of the government cutting away the life&hyphen;preservers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last Thursday, the Australian Bureau of Statistics released new labour force data. To the shame of the Howard government, that data revealed that unemployment continues to grow. Indeed, in one month 40,000 jobs disappeared&mdash;40,000 jobs disappeared, and my colleague opposite says that this government has made progress! The continued climb in unemployment has resulted in more than 809,000 Australians being out of work today: nearly 1 million Australians out of work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unemployment is the most insidious wound John Howard has inflicted on the people of Australia, because it affects every aspect of a person's life. It has implications for their standard of living, for their health, for their ability to plan and save for their future&mdash;and that, of course, is now an imperative, given the government's new policies on aged care&mdash;and for their ability to educate their children. The list goes on and on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like briefly to address a couple of the points that I have alluded to but first I would like to draw to the attention of the Committee the government's disastrous record on unemployment. In western societies, your job provides much more than your living. It provides you with social status, a sense of where you are in society. It is your identifier: `I'm an electrician,' or `I work for an insurance company.' The first inquiry we usually make of someone, once we know their name, is what do they do for a living. When we ask children what they want to do when they grow up, we expect them to name a trade or a profession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor has always recognised the importance to Australians of having a job. Our policies assured Australians that the safety net&mdash;or, in Saul's terms, the life&hyphen;preserver&mdash;was always firmly in place. When restructuring threatened whole areas of this country's economy, Labor set about instituting policies and programs to re&hyphen;educate the work force and reposition people into areas of job growth. Labor planned. It had a vision of where Australia was going, and we did all that we could to reduce the unemployment that was caused by us getting there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This budget was the government's opportunity to put in place its plan and to institute its own job creation policies. Unfortunately for Australia, the Liberal Party has no such plan. John Howard has no such vision. He does not care about the effect unemployment has on people&mdash; because, if he did, he would be doing something about it. Rather he is taking on those policies 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5472"> discredited following Margaret Thatcher's term in government in Great Britain: sink or swim policies, with no lifeboats or life preservers in sight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is sad, in a sense, that the Prime Minister, on his current journey to Britain, will be going to have those unfortunate Thatcherite policies reinforced in his mind when he sees Baroness Thatcher. One can only hope that he will be more impressed, and have more of an effect made on him, by the policies of the new Labour government in Britain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In last year's budget, the government cut public sector jobs, abolished employment programs, cut skills training and slashed industry programs. Now that that has resulted in increased unemployment, the Prime Minister is giving Australians more of the same. The economy has become stagnant. Confidence is at an all&hyphen;time low and business has stopped investing. Retail sales are down. Indeed, nearly every indicator is down. Without growth in the economy there can be no growth in employment. It is not just the Labor Party saying this; business is saying it, small business is saying it, the retail sector is saying it. Everybody is saying that this government is running the country into a recession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When BHP's closure of the steel mill in Newcastle saw 2,000 Australians dumped out of their jobs, what did the government do? The Prime Minister did nothing, the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) went to a casino opening, and the Prime Minister still has not found time to visit Newcastle since it happened. He has time to go to Lord's and he has time to go to stay at the Savoy Hotel in London. He can find time for the cricket in England, but he cannot find time to visit Newcastle. Two thousand Australians have lost their jobs, and the Prime Minister does not care. The government can give us no plans or policies about what they will do for Newcastle, just platitudes. If there is a metaphor for John Howard's government, it is in the very tardy approach that they have taken to what has happened to the people in Newcastle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, the only response the Liberals can make when they are questioned about unemployment is to say they are changing Australia's industrial laws; that is supposed to be how it works. Well it has not been enough and it will not be enough. The Liberal's new industrial relations environment will deliver lower wages and longer working hours for those Australians who are lucky enough to still be in a job. Forty thousand jobs lost last month; 800,000 Australians out of work; and all the government can say is, `Somehow or other, if you'll allow people to find a way to sack people quicker and more efficiently, that will create work.' I have always found that rather circular argument a bit strange. None of the changes that the government has made in the industrial relations area will result in a rise in employment. They have not so far, and they will not in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australians at all levels of society are becoming disillusioned with this government's attitude to jobs and are now starting to drop out of the work force. In Thursday's job figures we saw a huge fall in the participation rate, but my colleague over on the other side says that it is all going well. Indeed, the participation rate&mdash;</PARA>

The problem is going to be that if you are a male who is in your 50s and you lose your job under this government, you will have a long, long wait until you find another job. You will have a long, long wait, you will not have anything coming in and life will cost you more.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5473">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most Australians are too busy swimming to be able to wait; without life preservers they cannot afford to stop long enough to be relaxed and comfortable the way the Prime Minister would like us to be. It might be very relaxing and very comfortable flying first class to Britain to see the cricket. The view from Lord's or Kirribilli might be pretty cosy, pretty rosy, pretty relaxed and pretty comfortable. But the view from Kingsgrove in my electorate most certainly is not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What happens to those people who lose their jobs? Along with the loss of their pride, identity and confidence, often comes a worsening in their health. One of the greatest contributors to your health, or otherwise, is your employment status. Unemployed people are much more likely to suffer from illness and, once ill, to take much longer to recover.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How does this government help social security recipients and low income people when their health is compromised? They make them wait. In this budget the government has selected the less fortunate and targeted them with a new drugs tax. Under the government's new scheme, those Australians seeking access to the safest and most effective drugs will have to pay more, up to $30 a month more. Low income earners wanting to use these drugs will be forced to pay more or accept second&hyphen;rate drugs. The drugs affected by the government's new drug tax make up around one third of pharmaceutical benefits scheme spending as they treat chronic conditions such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, ulcers and depression, in patients who have often been on these drugs for years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In another move which will unfairly affect low income earners, the government is also closing 44 Medicare offices in urban areas. Those on tight budgets will now have to travel further to claim their rebates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another of the life preservers put in place by Labor governments over the decades, and even by Liberal governments, to protect the vulnerable has been aged care, and the people on the other side say `Rubbish'. They obviously think that is rubbish because they do not want to see anything done to protect aged Australians, the generation of people who went through the Depression, the Second World War, and who are now in their 70s and 80s and wanting to go into a nursing home. This government's answer to them is, `Come up with $80,000'. That is what they are going to have to do. The government commenced that process in the last budget and continues down that road now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has introduced a scheme of accommodation bonds for elderly people which will be the cruellest thing any government has done to old people in Australia since the Second World War. Those who are in a position of authority, those who are out of the water, who have had no experience of being at the mercy of others because of their financial status or poor health, are the ones who have forced these older Australians to have to sell their houses, or else have their children put up the money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These elderly people are people who have struggled all their lives to purchase a home yet now they will be placed in the invidious position of having to sell that house in order to purchase a place in a nursing home. Those who have not been fortunate enough to earn enough money to buy their own home will be in an even worse position. They will be at the mercy of nursing home owners and operators who will be able to pick and choose between applicants who have the money and those who have not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even nursing home owners and operators have objected to the government's policies in this area. One example in my electorate is St Basil's Home. They have written to me setting out a large number of concerns that they have with the government's program. Amongst the issues 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5474"> noted by Father Kapetas, the director of that service, as being of concern are appropriate prudential arrangements for the accommodation bonds, inadequate funding levels, a lack of indexation of those funding levels to meet the care needs of residents, and the lack of an external complaints handling process for residents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the debate on these bills, the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) did nothing to allay these concerns and many others raised by members. The government sees nothing wrong with making people pay their way, even if those people cannot afford it. There goes another life preserver.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister's lack of vision was never more evident than in relation to education. In 1996 the government took huge chunks out of the education budget, using the argument that those benefiting from education should pay. What he fails to appreciate is that Australia needs a better educated work force now than ever before. Countries seeking to grow their economies can only do so with a work force which is well educated and able to be retrained throughout their working lives. By preventing or punishing those seeking to gain an education, this government is doing the country a huge disservice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And this year's budget is no better than last year's. An amount of $72 million has been cut from vocational education and training grants to the states, and that is on top of the $183 million cut last year. The situation in relation to Austudy remains confused and is still a stumbling block to the children of low income earners seeking a tertiary education. Some 4,700 places are being cut through the abolition of the Commonwealth industry places scheme, and a further one per cent cut to funding to universities, coming as it does on top of last year's five per cent cut, will mean even fewer student places. Universities are slowly but surely being forced to give places over to fee paying students, those there on the basis of ability to pay rather than merit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of particular relevance to my electorate and the students who live there was the announcement by the University of New South Wales that it is closing its St George campus. This means that those wishing to study must travel much further to access relevant courses. The St George campus closure is a direct result of the cuts to university funding by the Howard government. Australia is going backwards to the period when all students paid fees and only the children of the rich or those lucky enough to win a scholarship could gain access to the highest level of education. Society's life&hyphen;preservers of a better educated citizenry seem to be in the process of being jettisoned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I could go on and on listing those areas where this government has attacked the very basis of our society&mdash;the safety net which was so carefully put in place over the decades by the Menzies government, the Whitlam government, the Fraser government and the Hawke and Keating governments. The unravelling of that safety net is happening at a very fast pace. Every time the people from my electorate look around, another life&hyphen;preserver has been cast adrift.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Without the security provided by those life&hyphen;preservers, society is starting to turn in on itself. People are looking for scapegoats, and this government, by its inaction, has created the monster of the One Nation Party. Unfortunately, I do not think the government is capable of nor willing to do anything to ensure that the problems it has created can be corrected. The government has allowed the Pauline Hanson cancer to spread across Australia&mdash;</PARA>

The One Nation Party cancer that she has spread across the country is something which will do Australia harm both at home and overseas. The government has been unwilling or unable to do anything about that. That is a shame for Australia. It is a shame for this parliament, and it is a shame that there are so few members on the government side who will stand up to this cancer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we look at where Australia will be going at the turn of the century, where our country will be at the centenary of Federation and what sort of a country we want to hand over to our children, it should not be a mean&hyphen;spirited and mean&hyphen;natured country. It should be a country that, rather than jettisoning the lifeboats and cutting away the life&hyphen;preservers, offers a helping hand to those who come here, to those who live here who are not as well off as some, and to those who want to make Australia the best country in the world to live in. I believe it is only by adopting that approach that we can progress as a nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When one sees the Prime Minister using the metaphor of Sir Robert Menzies and the tradition of the Liberal Party, one wonders whether Menzies and the people of his generation are turning in their graves. While there were very significant ideological differences between them and the Labor Party, I am sure that we agreed with many of the social things that the Menzies government did.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was a member of this parliament in the years that Malcolm Fraser was the Prime Minister of Australia. I always gave great credit to former Senator Margaret Guilfoyle, a very senior minister in that government, who always used to ensure that, while Fraser talked about axing and not taxing, the safety nets in this country were kept at such a level that those who were not as well off as others could survive and prosper.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, the budget last year and the budget this year have seen a very radical change from the approach that Liberal governments tended to take. The quote we saw in the paper last week from the Prime Minister when he arrived at cabinet many years ago, saying, `I'm not a Liberal; I'm a large `C' Conservative,'  was shown to be very true in the structure of this year's budget brought down by the government.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to be associated with the second Howard government budget. Through the passing of Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 199798, we will see some more way&hyphen;ahead programs in place and opportunity for more Australians, as detailed in this budget. That go forward is certainly detailed in the bill before us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a bill which offers an integrated approach. It is not a series of disparate ideas; it is a coordinated approach with the future in mind. It is all about Australians investing in themselves, their country, their companies and their jobs. It is about the creation of real jobs&mdash;jobs which can be sustained because industries will grow and confidence will return.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is all about people in small business in my electorate of Moreton who are concerned about a lot of the things that most average Australians are concerned about. There is a dent in the Australian psyche after 13 years of Labor government, which the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay) is trying to revisit and trying to revise in his contribution here tonight. There are people in my electorate who remain hurt and scared, whose confidence is  dented. They have been hurt by the false starts and the promises of that Labor regime. What do Labor say these days: if only they had a fourteenth year, it would have been okay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I certainly do support the approach that the Treasurer (Mr Costello) has offered. We do not need any more boom and bust in this country; we need no more kick in the guts economics 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5476"> as one lever is pulled here and something else is pulled there to just go on and produce more hurt and confusion. This government instead is working on the big structural changes, sustained and substantial economic growth and a return of a sense of security for Australians. We are talking about low inflation. We are talking about steady growth over the next decade. We are talking about repairing the financial situation that Labor left us. We are talking about reducing debt. We are talking about boosting investment. All of this equals job creation, and that is what it is all about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If throwing money at job creation would have solved the problems of unemployment, Labor would have fixed them. Instead, over 13 years they averaged 8.7 per cent unemployment in this country. Yet they stand here in their contributions to this debate and try and revisit the whole thing and suggest they have all the answers now. If only they had a fourteenth or fifteenth year, they keep saying. Let us face it, Mr Deputy Speaker, all Labor do is knock. All they want to do is knock, and prevent the government from getting on with its established program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at the recent Yellow Pages business survey, it showed that 30 per cent of small business believes the economy a year from now will be better, and 13 per cent say it will be worse. For my money, I will go with the 30 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the survey, small business was also asked what its prime concerns were. Third on the list of prime concerns was cash flow, at 11 per cent. The second concern for small business was lack of sales at 21 per cent. According to that Yellow Pages small business survey, the number one prime concern of the small business sector, a concern for 28 per cent of small business people, was none; there was absolutely no concern for them. The number one concern of 28 per cent of small business operators was no concern at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor opposition in recent weeks has been touting the positive&hyphen;negative indicators of that particular survey. Statistically, this outlines where the positives outweigh the negatives in the survey. This latest Yellow Pages index shows that negatives outweigh the positives to the tune of minus six per cent. That is a vast improvement on the last such survey under the previous government, where the result was minus 51 per cent. In other words, while small business would like to be happier&mdash;and I am sure most people on the government side understand all of this&mdash;the one thing that is for certain is that they are far more confident than when Labor was in power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will keep working on that growing confidence. We will keep working on the job of restoring confidence to the small business sector and, as the policies and measures we have undertaken kick in, confidence will grow even stronger.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Already we have seen evidence of the growth in confidence. The March quarter capital expenditure survey backs up the basis of the bill which is before us this evening: strong growth in business investment in 1996&hyphen;97. Business is starting to gear up again. Total capital expenditure in the first three quarters of 1996&hyphen;97 is 21 per cent higher than it was for the equivalent period a year ago. Business investment is very strong&mdash;at record levels&mdash;because of this government's lead. Interest rates are in fact at historic lows, and in addition the budget is turning from deficit to surplus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the Labor opposition's approach on all of this? They have basically opposed every point. The government's efforts to lock in monetary targets, low inflation, agreements between the Reserve Bank and the government: Labor just raved on and threatened to sue. The 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5477"> government's policy to take a $10.3 billion deficit and produce a $1.6 billion budget surplus was voted against on all measures by Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While this government stands for savings, low deficits, reduced debt and low interest rates, Labor is still the party of high deficits&mdash;who cares about that, they say&mdash;high debt, high interest rates, high taxes and no small business accommodation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No&hyphen;one on the opposition side understands small business. There was evidence enough of that after 13 years of its dreadful government. While on this side we stand for small business, the return of confidence, investment and the creation of real jobs, in the Labor Party the contrast continues. Labor wants to slow down our programs of reform and thwart our efforts through the Senate. The Australian Democrats and the ALP should stand condemned for the hurt that their delays are causing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The great debate is starting&mdash;and we would like it to be a mature debate&mdash;on the question of reform of the taxation system. Everybody in this country, except the Labor Party, accepts that there is a need for reform. Already, it is showing it wants to play politics yet again. If Labor delays the reforms that may come out of the debate process, battlers in this country, people on average wages, are going to start paying the top rate of tax. Rather than grow up and participate in a mature debate on the taxation system, Labor would much rather see average weekly wage earners paying the top rate of tax. It would much rather see more job losses in the public sector, as well as the private, rather than face up to tax reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After all, the evidence is there&mdash;elements of last year's budget were still being passed the day before this year's budget was introduced. A good example of the effect of that is the Mount Gravatt Training Centre in my electorate. Pat Milley and her team have been waiting for the new training regime to start. They have been putting time and effort in since this government came to power, planning for the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That centre is committed to the training of people for new jobs, and yet the Labor&hyphen;Democrat cabal and its delays in the Senate have caused lost staff, lost expertise, a decline in the esprit de corps, and lost morale. They will not pass those bills in the Senate. They have put them in a very long queue. What about the thousands of people in and around my electorate who could have been helped by the training that Pat and her team wanted to provide? Does Labor care? Obviously not, otherwise it would expedite matters in the other place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Compare this reckless approach to the devil&hyphen;may&hyphen;care, all risk, no responsibility approach of Crean and the $2 billion new work opportunities approach of the previous government. That $2 billion new work opportunities fiasco is part of the debt reduction program costs that we now face as a government. So desperate was the previous government to cover up unemployment before the last election, it threw money at it&mdash;$2 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One group which received funds in my electorate was the Brisbane South Community Group. Between 21 August and 7 November 1995, that group received $618,952 in three separate contracted amounts. It has received nothing since this government came to office. That was frustrating for me at the outset because I sought to represent their views and concerns, but now I understand why they have not received the money. It is because the earlier funds have not been acquitted. In other words, over $600,000 was thrown at this community group under  Labor&mdash;under its drunken spending spree on new work opportunities&mdash;and no money has so far been acquitted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Former employees of this particular organisation have raised matters with me, as have so many others in my local community who have lent moral support to Brisbane South 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5478"> Community Group&mdash;churches, service clubs, political representatives on all sides&mdash;and I now feel rather used and cheated by this organisation. Brisbane South Community Group failed to pay employees. It failed to pay the Australian Taxation Office PAYE collections. It failed to pay rent. It failed to pay Telstra bills. It failed to do a lot of things, and yet it was the recipient of money under the devil&hyphen;may&hyphen;care approach of the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Brisbane South Community Group has been kicked out of its Annerley office in my electorate. It has been kicked out of the Victoria Point office in the electorate of the honourable member for Fadden and Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Jull). It claims that the Mount Gravatt office is still operating&mdash;it is an office which we shared with the member for Griffith (Mr McDougall). This organisation has taken taxpayer funds and not accounted for them. Past staff, community group members, service club members and local schools have all painted the same picture to me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rosebud Hansen, a tireless worker in the Annerley area, and Kaye Bailey were two ex&hyphen;workers who took action, quite rightly, before the Industrial Relations Commission recently. They are seeking redress for their wage complaints. Last month the company chairman, Robin Whittaker, was ordered to pay $10,000 to those two women. If funds are not paid by the end of June, a warrant will be issued allowing police to seize property belonging to the company and to Mr Whittaker. The ATO is also after the Brisbane South Community Group for failure to pay $64,073 in group income tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The company started to fail to pay wages in February 1996, just three months after the last dollop of Labor's NWO slush fund was received. The Queensland government has even chipped in with over $40,000 in funds last year for programs run by Rosebud Hansen, and yet she was not paid. I have been lobbied since the election by the group, especially by program coordinator, Aaron Lucas. I went in to bat for them because they presented themselves so well, had the backing of so many good, decent, committed citizens in my electorate, and had high aspirations. However, along with so many others, I know I have been used and misled. Where the funds have gone and why the hopes of hundreds of young unemployed have been dashed are questions which beg an answer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is obvious to me that the Brisbane South Community Group was born out of an unreal environment prior to the last election. It was encouraged by a government which really was not interested in job creation, it was interested only in hiding the unemployed. So over $600,000 worth of taxpayers' funds have not been acquitted. Yet, down to their last breath, they are claiming the lack of acquittal of funds arises because of some obscure litigation involving their auditor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This Mr Aaron Lucas has also used my representations to Senator Vanstone seeking clarification of a lack of funds from the new government as an excuse to debtors. It also seems that he claimed constantly that more money was coming and that bills would be paid. Essentially, the imprimatur of the government's new programs was being used by this group. This government has not fallen for that, unlike the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been frustrating to me that while my representations on behalf of so many other groups have been successful, this group was unsuccessful, but now we know. I must say that if only  DEETYA had been more forthcoming earlier, that if only Labor had been more responsible with the funds that it threw at new work opportunities prior to the last elections, this money would never have been wasted.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5479">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Essentially, the whole episode disgusts me and so many others in my community. Local papers will be running this story tomorrow. I must say that when it is all said and done, in the context of this bill before us today, it is refreshing to see that we now have a government that has focused on real job creation, on long&hyphen;term investment that is going to produce results, and is not prepared to just throw money at the problem and hope it fixes itself, as Labor did.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that the Labor Party and the Democrats will stand in the way of so many more of this new government's efforts to do something genuine for the unemployed, and that amazes me.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to be able to participate in this debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1997&hyphen;98. For my electorate of Gilmore, this budget has been a good news budget as it acknowledges my three core commitments to the electorate: investment, infrastructure and jobs. The Treasurer's statements were well received as the people of Gilmore are fully aware of the pressing economic circumstances that make the need to balance the budget a government priority. It is something they understand in their own lives. They know that no&hyphen;one can live beyond their means and that if you owe money, it has to be paid back. They understand that ultimately they will be the people who have to repay that debt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, it is certainly good news to see the government widen its ongoing commitment to Gilmore by providing solutions to the very real problems facing rural and regional Australia. However, a good budget alone, no matter how positive the initiatives, no matter how high the level of government financial commitment, is still not sufficient to address the real social problems faced by too many families in Gilmore. Although today I will speak about what Gilmore has gained, not for a moment have I lost sight of what is still to be achieved in an area in which unemployment and concerns for small business remain very high.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After 13 years in which the difficulties faced by Gilmore were not recognised, I have always maintained that, given some assistance in providing infrastructure, then investments, jobs and self-reliance would follow. Whilst this budget makes no direct reference to our much needed major highway link, Main Road 92, the Shoalhaven Highway, work is continuing with the three tiers of government working together in preparing a feasibility study for making this major highway link a reality. There is no doubt that this access to the Hume Highway and Canberra is of vital importance to Gilmore's economic future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our export markets are increasing and we need an alternate route through which to transport our goods. At the moment the beautiful, environmentally sensitive area of Kangaroo Valley is bearing the brunt of the traffic, and the trucks, and now double-B bogies, as there is simply no alternative to the Nowra&hyphen;Canberra&hyphen;Melbourne freight connection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Already there has been a commitment made by the Shoalhaven City Council in funding the initial studies that have proven the immense cost-benefit ratio to my electorate and adjoining regions and I congratulate the Shoalhaven City Council on showing the required leadership in dealing with such a pressing issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that, with the commenced upgrading of HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Albatross</EMPHASIS>, Main Road 92 will allow further gains to be made by easier, quicker access to defence links and embassies in Canberra. This will then become a road link of national significance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The commencement of the eastern gas pipeline also displays confidence in my electorate of Gilmore with the major part of its construction following the proposed Main Road 92 route. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5480"> This would clearly provide for the expansion of those areas, thus guaranteeing future investment in the area and much needed job creation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst the Department of Defence has been, to a great extent, immune to the hardship experienced by other departments, a great deal of internal restructuring has taken place. Fortunately for the people of Gilmore, this has meant increased spending on our defence operations, and with it the decision to strengthen the operations of HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Albatross</EMPHASIS>, a major naval base located in my electorate to the south of Nowra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A stage 1 budget of $35 million was allocated, providing an influx of capital into the community in the course of this financial year. That will mean more jobs for local residents and businesses. But, more importantly, the government has kept its word on its long&hyphen;term commitment to the area by providing capital funding for major works at <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Albatross</EMPHASIS> for many years to come. The upgrading at <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Albatross</EMPHASIS> will benefit our community in many ways by the extension to and maintenance of defence personnel housing. In fact, a further 52 houses will be built and/or replaced. These will either be purchased in the local market or built by local operators at an estimated cost of $5&half; million. All this contributes to giving the local economy the short&hyphen;term kick&hyphen;start it so desperately needs and long&hyphen;term assurances that any business in the area cannot ignore. I thank the minister and his staff for their efforts to bring about an outcome so beneficial to my community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have never subscribed to the view that development must come at the expense of the environment, and neither has this government. To date, some $280,000 has been received for Coastcare projects. I am extremely hopeful that the government's $1 billion National Heritage Trust will directly benefit our environment, with our pristine icon of Jervis Bay, a myriad of waterways and an unsurpassed ecosystem. In fact, the recent announcement of this government's funding of $6.9 million for the Nowra university will see it in operation by the year 2000. We are also quietly confident that our heritage fund will assist in making the technology for Jervis Bay the foundation of ocean medicine development, food cultivation and fish farming.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many stakeholders in our coastal environment. They include developers, federal, state and local government, Aboriginal communities, commercial and industrial users and those who earn their living from the coast, such as our fishermen at Ulladulla and surrounding villages. Given such strong and competitive interests and commitment, there is obviously a need to balance these at government and community level. Therefore, I cannot stress enough the importance of a National Heritage Trust for my electorate of Gilmore.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have spoken in the House before about the level of unemployment in Gilmore. It is no secret that the number of jobless is disproportionately high in our area. This concerns me greatly. However, the message I get in my meetings with both the jobless and small business operators is unchanged: let small business employ, let it expand and create opportunities for the jobless and, above all, help small business remove the industrial shackles imposed by years of Labor neglect.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has also contributed half a million dollars towards a business incubator in my electorate of Gilmore&mdash;another example of small business and the unemployed being recognised by this government. I am simply amazed by Labor's refusal to support our small business by the further reform of unfair dismissal legislation. It is well known that the demands of current unfair dismissal legislation are the biggest deterrents for businesses employing fewer than 15 employees.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5481">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The launching of our supermarket to Asia project in the next few months will be yet another incentive for businesses in my electorate. The project will have the clear objective of devising a more effective strategy for marketing the produce of local farmers and businesses. This will be of particular significance to us, as there is no doubt that there is a market for our products in Asia and the Middle East. The supermarket to Asia project will expand our strategy and bring our products to the attention of importers throughout the region. This will be another example of three tiers of government working together for the long&hyphen;term prosperity of our community. Still on the topic of investment, as of 1 July what all businesses have asked for is the capital gains tax rollover of funds with the $5 million for reinvestment into other business or for retirement superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a perfect world there would be no need for DSS offices in my electorate of Gilmore; everyone would have jobs and no&hyphen;one would be in need of government assistance. Unfortunately, a perfect world is still a fair way off. Therefore, with the support of DSS manager David Tagg and his enthusiastic staff, I am pleased to announce that Gilmore has received the go&hyphen;ahead for the establishment of a new one&hyphen;stop shop DSS. This project is worth over $1 million to our community and again shows this government's commitment to regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have reminded my constituents that it was this government that increased the allowance for carers&mdash;of which we have many. On top of that, in Gilmore we have received another 40 aged care places for those who wish to remain at home, with appropriate care, as opposed to going into a nursing home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another issue which has raised debate in my electorate is the recent <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bringing them home</EMPHASIS> report, which has given all Australians a chance to reflect on our history and the role it plays in defining our national identity. An unfortunate outcome of the report has been a hardening of two philosophical positions. Some endorse what has been referred to as the `black armband' view of our history, focusing on the sins of our forefathers. In so doing, people make no reference to the important and commendable achievements made in 200 years of European civilisation in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another school of thought that would have us believe that this history is irrelevant to our everyday lives, that the injustices suffered by our indigenous population are in no way connected to the plight of Gilmore's Aboriginal communities today. Like so many of those that I have spoken to in my electorate, I see myself as somewhere in the middle of the spectrum. What I advocate is a type of compassionate pragmatism and a total and frank recognition of what has happened in Australia, but always with an eye on the best way forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last week, an Aboriginal elder came to speak to me about recent developments. She explained that for her, the stolen generation is an example of history affecting the present. It is a wound that will not heal for many Aboriginal Australians; a pain which cannot be erased and will be part of the identity of indigenous Australians for generations to come. This is something I accept completely. I have no qualms in personally saying, `Sorry', as there is no need to see a personal apology as a recognition of personal responsibility. I was not involved with the tragic events and my personal apology is merely a recognition that Australian history has been kind to me while forcing enormous hardships onto fellow Australians. As politicians, we should be capable of acknowledging the emotional depth of the issues we discuss and responding to such issues with compassion and sensitivity. It is also important that while 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5482"> condemning the practice of the removal of Aboriginal children, we do not overlook the fact that in some cases at least, meaningful and loving relationships were formed between the removed children and their adoptive families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now look forward to being part of a government that looks to the future, to the creation of a brighter future for all Australian individuals, and for all of Australia's most needy communities. In conclusion, as I stated earlier, for Gilmore it was certainly a good news budget, one that will create even greater opportunities as we pursue the potential for federation funding and the National Heritage Trust.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I am pleased to respond to the debate in respect of the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1997&hyphen;98 on behalf of the government and the Treasurer (Mr Costello), in particular. I note that some 40 to 45 members of the government have contributed to this debate and supported the budget measures introduced by the Treasurer. What that debate has shown is that there is enormous support from both within this parliament&mdash;particularly all members of the government&mdash;but more particularly from outside the parliament, from the business sector and from the Australian electorate generally. The reason for that is that, in an economically responsible manner, the budget builds upon and it extends the progress that is being made by the Howard&hyphen;Fischer budget some nine months ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">First and foremost, this budget is about a fair and equitable approach to the government's accounts. The consolidated measures of the government have turned around a $10.3 billion deficit that was left to us, of course, by Labor and turned it into a sizeable headline surplus in the 1997&hyphen;98 budget of some $5 billion and, by 1998&hyphen;99, there will be an underlying surplus of $1.6 billion. For the first time in almost a decade&mdash;in fact, for the first time this decade&mdash;the Minister for Finance did not have to follow the Treasurer on budget night and introduce a loan bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that in this coming year the Commonwealth will repay over $5 billion of government debt. That will free future generations of Australians from the debt associated with servicing the debt that was threatening to drown this particular parliament, this particular government and this particular operation of government. So successful is the government's strategy of addressing the overall structure of the budget that it has been estimated that in the period since the government came into office until the year 2000&hyphen;2001, the Commonwealth's net debt to GDP ratio will almost halve. This will ensure that Australians can face the new millennium in the knowledge that the country's future has been secured. The remarkable turnaround has occurred without having to increase taxes, be it income tax, company tax, wholesale sales tax, or for that matter, excise on petrol.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the difficulties faced in addressing the structural problems in the budget left to us by Labor, we have been able to introduce a number of initiatives in this budget. I will just add a couple of those initiatives. We have introduced, for the first time by an Australian government, a broadly based savings rebate; improvements in the superannuation arrangements and the tightening of rules governing access to superannuation prior to retirement; the provision of greater choice about where Australians can invest their superannuation contributions; the introduction of a deferred pension bonus plan for older Australians; a commitment to maintain the pension at 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings; and the increase in the ordinary domiciliary nursing care benefit to align it with the child disability allowance.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5483">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other features include: additional funding of $54 million under the Commonwealth&hyphen;state disability agreement; improvements to entry level training incentive payments designed to encourage employers to take on apprentices and trainees; introduction of the work for the dole scheme; building on the government's commitment to reduce compliance costs for small business by streamlining the withholding tax arrangements; and the doubling of the deduction under the income test for second and subsequent children to allow more families access to Austudy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet more features include: an additional $76 million to increase our quarantine capacity and improve our quarantine service; the provision of $1.25 billion for expenditure by the Natural Heritage Trust over the next six years; and the creation of the Federation Fund to finance major projects of national significance to mark the centenary of Federation and to contribute to many of Australia's infrastructure needs for the coming century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, the budget builds upon the strategy begun in last year's budget to turn around Australia's financial position and to provide the framework to accelerate the pace of sustainable economic growth, the creation of real job opportunities and the maintenance of a regime of lower interest rates. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA>

The main problem the Labor Party has with the budget strategy is its reliance on failed economic dogma. It very much reflects the coalition's wasted years in opposition and its inability to fashion a reform program outside the shortcomings of orthodox economic theory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 1997&hyphen;98 and its budget strategy, it is very clear that a measure of the government's failure comes from its own determination to hold out tax reform as something of a distraction to the way in which the budget has been received around the country.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the one minute and 24 seconds I had prior to the division, I was demolishing the government's budget strategy and exposing its many flaws. Now, thankfully, I have been advised that the main purpose of this debate is to address capital outlays in the budget, so having dispensed with the general strategy I can move to the more specific.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is an item out of my electorate that is a capital works of great waste. The fact that the government in this budget and, I believe, in earlier budgets has been allocating funds for the construction of a hospital, an important capital facility, at the Holsworthy army base is an appropriation that needs to be questioned, more so with the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) present in the Main Committee chamber. How wasteful it is for a government to be outlaying some $20 million on the construction of a hospital at Holsworthy when the government also has these grievous plans for the construction of Sydney's second international airport on the same site.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When this proposition was first raised, I had a concern that the hospital might in fact be adept forward planning; the idea that, with all that unexploded ordnance around at Holsworthy, the first plane that would land at such an airport may well require a modern, state of the art hospital nearby for the looming catastrophe. If the government is engaging in that sort of forward planning, I would ask them to desist. There is a better way to handle this matter, of course, and that is not to engage in the folly of Holsworthy, and to allow the $20 million to be well spent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure the military hospital relocated out of my electorate, at Ingleburn, to the seat of Hughes, at the Holsworthy base, is a needed facility. There is no doubt about that. But it has to be a facility that is used for military purposes, not to literally mop up the tragedy of bad planning and bad decision making in relation to the site of Sydney's second international airport. I know, in making those comments, that that is a proposition that the Minister for Finance would support for two reasons. One is: why waste $20 million on the construction of a hospital when the government also has a plan for an airport? But I also know&mdash;and this is the second reason&mdash;that he is busting out of his skin to actually say something about Holsworthy and engage himself in the public debate. The only thing that is stopping him is said to be the release of the EIS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why someone needs an EIS to tell them that an international airport with two 4,000&hyphen;metre runways directed at large residential areas is a problem, I am yet to work out. But if the Minister for Finance can just use a bit of logic in this matter, and understand that his constituents are screaming for representation and screaming for him to say something about Holsworthy, maybe this issue of the capital outlay for the hospital is his entree to that particular debate. So, as Minister for Finance and member for Macarthur, at long last he can find a legitimate reason to enter the Holsworthy debate, to actually represent the people in his electorate who are so concerned, and to do it in a fiscally responsible fashion. That is, to say that the capital outlay for the hospital would be wasted if the airport goes ahead and the hospital and other major facilities need to be demolished, and that this is a poor allocation of Commonwealth funding.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5485">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an issue that is alive in the south west of Sydney and, indeed, throughout the region of greater western Sydney, as you would appreciate, Mr Deputy Speaker. Of all the crazy things that have been said and done in relation to the Holsworthy site, there is nothing more absurd than spending scarce public funds on a hospital, knowing that the allocation of a site for the airport at Holsworthy could lead to the demolition of that facility. With all the hospital needs, the health care needs and the capital facilities that are required around Australia, how wasteful it is for the government to be allocating that money and having the prospect of folly being held out by the site of Sydney's second international airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The whole question of capital funding in the health area is also critical out of this budget, because there is a clear instance of folly, cost shifting and resource shifting in the way in which the government is holding out $500 million worth of incentives for private health insurance, but at the same time is dramatically reducing, I think by $800 million, the funding that is going through to the states for hospitals. So right across the board, and with the hospital funding at Holsworthy and the misuse of those resources, there is a need for the member for Macarthur to launch himself into the debate on behalf of his constituents, and to do so in a fiscally responsible fashion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is your clear entree. Come into the debate, represent your electorate and say that it is a bad waste of the $20 million to go ahead with an airport when the hospital is just being completed at Holsworthy. But you should also recognise that, in the south&hyphen;west of Sydney, there is a sad legacy of the period of the Fahey state government. Hospital resources are so inadequate throughout the region because they would not do anything about the reallocation of capital resources in health from the centre of Sydney to where they are needed on Sydney's fringe&mdash;the great population region. So here is Labor again having to tidy up all the problems that were caused by mismanagement by the Fahey state government and now by lack of representation by the honourable member in the federal parliament. I am here tidying these things up and giving the best advice I can on all sorts of matters&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to this set of expenditures, I mention that contained in the last amount of money is provision for the administration of the Taxation Office and I wish to make some comments about the saving scheme contained in this year's budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5487">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I indicated in my second reading speech, on the evidence of the Secretary of the Treasury to the Senate estimates committee, the Treasury has indicated&mdash;unlike the Treasurer&mdash;that perhaps there is some doubt about the potential effectiveness of the scheme as proposed, in that it may not have the required outcome on national savings. I wish to take this opportunity to talk about the saving scheme in relation to my electorate because I believe that it is a sick joke that will do nothing for the majority of my constituents. The latest available figures released by the Australian Taxation Office show that half of the taxpayers in Lalor, Thomastown and Epping&mdash;suburbs within my electorate&mdash;did not earn any interest from savings at all. These people will get no savings rebate whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those people who had savings which earned interest earned an average of $492. This translates into an average annual rebate of $74 per year&mdash;about $1.40 a week, or less than 20c a day. This I believe to be a sad joke. Perhaps my constituents will be able to put this pathetic amount towards their child&hyphen;care costs, which will increase because of cuts in this area. Perhaps they will be able to put it towards the increased costs of their medication because of the changes to the PBS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps they can put the 20c towards the nursing home entry charges for their parents that this government seeks to introduce. Perhaps it can be used towards their fee for employment services, which the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, seeks to introduce. Half of these people will receive an average rebate of 20c; the other half will receive nothing. This savings initiative is nothing but a shameful hoax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is all the more contemptible because it comes at the expense of superannuation contributions which would have assisted these people in retirement and would have achieved a great deal towards boosting national savings. Those in their mid&hyphen;30s on average weekly earnings who are lucky enough to get the 20c a day must be aware that it comes at the expense of $110,000 from their retirement income packages&mdash;that is, $110,000 less towards national savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In putting together the statistics for the suburbs in my electorate, I was particularly disappointed to find that the Australian Taxation Office no longer gives the type of detail by postcode that it used to. I believe that, in the interests of meaningful analysis, the ATO should attempt to present the statistics in such a way that they are easily able to be compared.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also interesting that, since the bringing down of the budget by the Treasurer, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has gone into his kitbag of emergency notions to try to deflect from other issues and grabbed at tax reform, but tax reform in the minds of this government is a code for the introduction of a GST. At the time when a GST was previously proposed, it was contended by the proposers that a consumption tax in some way leads to an increase in national savings on the basis that, because it is a tax on consumption, people will be less likely to consume and, therefore, spend money and thus retain savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people in the suburbs that I mentioned earlier have very little non&hyphen;discretionary expenditure. They will not be able not to decide to buy the things that they need for day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day living and, therefore, there will be no effect on national savings because of those people's expenditure and spending patterns. I believe that as the debate continues on the goods and services tax&mdash;because that appears to be the major plank that the government proposes to raise as part of its tax reform package&mdash;we will need to look at the experiences in other countries that have shown that these types of GSTs have not had the proposed effect on savings.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5488">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The debate that we are going to see about a GST is not a substitute for the government looking at policies in the area of employment. The GST and the types of tax reforms that the government is going to propose in the lead&hyphen;up to the next election do nothing for the creation of jobs or to give people a greater sense of job security. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to address my remarks in the debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1997&hyphen;98 to the foreign aid allocation for 1997&hyphen;98 and, in particular, to the allocation for Africa. It is deplorable that for the second year under the Liberal government the ODA vote has been reduced in nominal terms and that it has been cut in real terms by 12.6 per cent over the past two years. As a percentage of GDP, it has fallen from 0.31 per cent to 0.27 per cent in that time&mdash;the lowest level for several decades. But even more deplorable is the cut in aid to Africa, aid which has been reduced in nominal terms from $108.7 million in 1995&hyphen;96 to $87.7 million in 1997&hyphen;98&mdash;a cut of $21 million or 19.3 per cent. In real terms, this amounts to a cut of 22.7 per cent. That is a reduction of almost one&hyphen;quarter in just two years&mdash;almost double the real cut in total aid.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why was Africa singled out for especially severe treatment? The government, through its minister or in its budget papers, gives no explanation except to try to excuse the cut by pointing to the IDA contribution to the World Bank and saying that, as 40 per cent of the International Development Association funds are allocated to Africa, 40 per cent of our IDA contribution for 1997&hyphen;98 of $121.5 million will be spent in Africa, resulting in a total Australian contribution to Africa of $140 million. However, this excuse ignores the fact that this point is true every year and that the allocation for IDA this year is actually $6 million less than for the previous year. The $140 million figure is also a rounding&hyphen;up of an actual figure of $136.3 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that there is no excuse for cutting funds to Africa, especially not to a greater degree than the cut to aid overall. This is especially so if, as the minister claims in his foreword to the budget paper on page xi under the heading of Australia's overseas aid program 1997&hyphen;98, the principal objectives of Australia's aid program should be to ensure the reduction of poverty and the promotion of economic development as a permanent means of overcoming such poverty. If those are the principal objectives of the government's aid, how can it possibly justify slashing funds by one&hyphen;quarter for the poorest continent in the world, the continent experiencing the greatest difficulty in achieving economic development?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just look at the facts: 33 of the 48 least developed countries in the world are in Africa. Most of these countries have a GDP per capita of less than $US2 per day. Indeed, World Bank figures show that, in 1993, there were 219 million people in sub&hyphen;Saharan Africa&mdash;40 per cent of the region's population&mdash;living on less than $US1 per day, and that that number had increased by 40 million in the six years up to 1993. In regard to poverty, Africa, especially sub&hyphen;Saharan Africa, is clearly well qualified for our aid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to economic development, Africa's economic performance has been very poor until the past year or so. Over the 15 years from 1980&hyphen;94, real GDP per capita for Africa declined by 15 per cent. Many African countries now have a level of real income per head less than in 1970. Although economic growth has improved in the past year or two&mdash;with an 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5489"> overall growth rate of five per cent in 1996 and a similar outcome expected this year&mdash;these rates of growth are nowhere near high enough to make a marked impact on widespread poverty. As World Bank Vice&hyphen;President Madavo said in Nairobi last month, what is needed is rates of growth of eight to 10 per cent if Africa is to eradicate crippling poverty. Clearly, that is not going to happen. World Bank forecasts are for growth in sub&hyphen;Saharan Africa to be 3&half; to four per cent in the near future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A major debilitating impediment to growth in many African countries is their extremely high levels of foreign debt and official debt. Of the 41 most indebted poor countries in the world in 1994, 27 had a foreign debt to GDP ratio of over 100 per cent, and 21 of those countries were African. Furthermore, 13 of those 27 countries&mdash;12 of them African&mdash;had scheduled interest payments on government borrowings of over 100 per cent of government revenue. Obviously, they cannot allocate anywhere near 100 per cent of revenue to their debt servicing, so their debt mounts inexorably and their financial predicament becomes even more excruciating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, such countries obtain virtually no benefit from rapidly expanding private capital flows to developing countries, flows which all go to a handful of countries. Sub&hyphen;Saharan Africa got 3.6 per cent of foreign direct investment to developing countries in 1994. Accordingly, the foreign aid allocation for Africa is highly unrepresentative of the need for economic development in that region. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to speak on these appropriations for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and I am pleased to see in the chamber the Minister for Trade and Acting Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer). We are all conscious of the very important role he plays as the Minister for Trade.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of particular concern to me are the savage cuts that have been imposed on the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade by this budget. I know it is always difficult as you are dealing with competing interests, but I cannot see why we have closed our mission in Copenhagen. It played a very important role not only in Denmark but also in the other countries that it had responsibility for. I suppose this will be an extra burden now on the post in Sweden until they close that mission. I had always hoped that at some time we would be able to open an office in Helsinki and in that way deal with some of the countries nearby, such as Latvia. That hope, I suppose, is now fading even further.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also closed our post in Nauru, not that that would have brought much here, but it sent an important message. What we are doing by cutting funds to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is sending all the wrong messages about Australia's interest in the area. The member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) spoke very eloquently about the cut to foreign aid to Africa. I notice in front of me the excellent report prepared by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia's relations with Southern Africa</EMPHASIS>. I was the chair of that committee until the election and so someone else had the honour of bringing it down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee put a lot of work into that report and it has been very well received, not only here but also in Africa. We highlighted many of the points that the member for Gellibrand was making about poverty in Africa. Although we were dealing with the SADC countries, we had hoped that in bringing down that report we would rekindle Australia's declining interest in Africa. We made much, during the apartheid years, of our interest in southern Africa. However, since democracy has come to South Africa we seem to be withdrawing from there and not showing any interest at all.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5490">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apart from the cut to aid, my other concern is the cut to funds for population programs. I had hoped that we would restore funding to the IPPF and to the United Nations Fund for Population and Development that was so savagely and severely cut in last year's budget. At a time when Australia was increasing its funding in that area, we came in and cut massive amounts of money from those two programs. Although we did not cut more this time, neither did we put extra funds in there. I thought that at some time the cuts last year, savage as they were, would have only been a temporary measure and we would have started to redress the balance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These population programs are important, especially to our near neighbours in the Pacific. We are sending all the wrong messages. I said that last year, and nothing has changed my mind. We are sending the wrong messages to those Pacific countries. We are indicating to them that Australia does not care, that Australia has no concern for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The one issue that I and everyone I speak to cannot understand is the cut to Radio Australia. Why do it? Minister, you more than most of us would know the important role that Radio Australia plays throughout Asia. It is not expensive&mdash;a couple of posts at a mission would pay for it. However, once we cut that service it will never recover. Do not think that by us cutting our radio service that there is not going to be a service there. The Brits are coming in, as are the French and the Chinese. Many nations are trying to come in there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the very time when other countries are coming in and when Australia is making much of our relationship with Asia, we are cutting the cheapest and most effective way of getting across our message to Asia about what Australia is and what it stands for. We are doing that by cutting funds to Radio Australia. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, further to my earlier remarks, I want to indicate that I believe there is another reason why we should be maintaining, if not increasing, funds to Africa. That is, that this region, apart from being poor and having great trouble in establishing economic development, is currently facing the scourge of HIV/AIDS in a devastating way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Consider these facts: in October 1996 the UN estimated that, for the whole world, six million people have died of AIDS and that there are 22 million people currently living with HIV/AIDS, which number is increasing by 8,500 a day or 3.1 million a year. Of that 22 million, 21 million are adults, over 40 per cent of them women, and one million are children&mdash;most of whom have been HIV infected in their mother's womb or, post&hyphen;birth, infected by their mother's milk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the concern this disease has created in developed countries, it is the developing countries, which account for 90 per cent of HIV/AIDS sufferers, which have the real problem. Nowhere is this more true than in sub&hyphen;Saharan Africa where 13 million people have HIV/AIDS&mdash;that is, about 60 per cent of the world total. The extent of this epidemic in a number of sub&hyphen;Saharan countries is absolutely devastating. For instance, in Zambia, out of a population of 9.4 million, it was estimated in 1995 that 1&half; million people were HIV positive&mdash;that is, 17 per cent of the population. This did not include full&hyphen;blown AIDS sufferers. One in three of the population aged between 15 and 50 was HIV positive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Botswania, population 1.4 million, an estimated 180,000 people, or 13 per cent of the population, were HIV positive. In Zimbabwe, population 10.9 million, there were an estimated one million HIV positive cases, or nine per cent of the population and one in four of the age group 15 to 50. In Malawi, population 9.6 million, an estimated one million people were HIV 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5491"> positive&mdash;over 10 per cent of the population. By way of comparison, Australia, with a population of 18 million, has about 11,000 people currently living with HIV/AIDS&mdash;that is, 0.06 per cent of the population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The impact of this pandemic on the sub&hyphen;Sahara is already severe and will become more so as the vast numbers of HIV infected people become AIDS sufferers. Apart from the great increase in human suffering and loss of life, there are extremely serious social, economic and even potentially political consequences from this holocaust. Family life is being devastated by the death of parents, with many children ending up in crowded orphanages or becoming homeless street kids in the cities. Families are forced into debt and poverty through the extra health cost they have to bear and the loss of productive family members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Education levels are being reduced through the inability of stricken families to afford school fees or because children are needed to earn a living or to care for the sick, and also because of the deaths of many teachers. The health system of these countries is being overwhelmed. In Zimbabwe, in many hospitals over half of the beds are taken up with sufferers from HIV&hyphen;related illnesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The economies of these countries are also being severely affected. Large additional costs are imposed on the economy through the need to fund prevention programs, as well as greatly increased health costs to care for those infected. This puts great pressure on already strained, if not overwhelmed, budgets and crowds out any other necessary expenditures for social and economic development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, with the disease concentrated on the most productive age group, the widespread loss of skilled personnel is reducing both the quantity and quality of labour. This is especially the case for white&hyphen;collar professionals, which group has the highest incidence of infection. Accordingly, these countries are losing many of their most skilled managerial and professional people in business, the public service, teaching and academia. Even parliaments are severely affected. For instance, in Zambia, which has a parliament of 155 seats, there have been 22 by&hyphen;elections in the last two years due to deaths, of which 20 are thought to be AIDS related. Thus, institutional infrastructures and the quality of government are at risk of being undermined by the loss of such personnel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So too are the enterprises of these nations which face continual loss of their key personnel and management, loss of productivity through employees being ill on the job or absent because of their illness or the illness of other family members. The impact on some industries will be absolutely staggering. In Zambia, a study of the copper industry several years ago showed 60 per cent of the labour force in the industry were HIV positive&mdash;this in an industry which accounts for 90 per cent of Zambian exports and 25 per cent of its GDP. Exports from these countries will also be adversely affected by the impact of HIV/AIDS on agriculture and the likely diversion of tourism to less risky destinations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the statistic that perhaps best sums up the horrific nature of what is happening in these countries is UNDP's estimate that, without AIDS, African life expectancy would have been 62 years by the year 2000, but with AIDS it is expected to be only 47 years. How, one may ask, in the face of such a total calamity, can we in all conscience slash our aid to these countries? But that is what we have done. Shame on those who are responsible!</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, this is my maiden speech as a minister in this particular chamber. At the outset I want to say that I acknowledge the sincerity of the views held by the member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5492"> the contribution he made to this estimates hearing, and also the sincerity of the views of the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In response to those views let me say that it is never easy, given the challenges of government, to work through an exact allocation of priorities within each portfolio and between portfolios. I am sure the member for Gellibrand can well recall during his previous ministerial positions when in government just how difficult that process can be. You do have to make judgments on priorities. You do have to arrive at the right conclusions with regard to program allocations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This year Australia's aid budget under the provisions of this budget will be $1.430 billion. In the tight budgetary circumstances, as we build towards a surplus in next year's budget, this represents a decrease of only one per cent on the estimated 1996&hyphen;97 outlays. It is a large amount of money; it is $1.430 billion. Yes, it has been shaved over the last two years and had we not been left with the huge Beazley $8 billion plus black hole, we would not have had to embark on this path.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are very conscious of the need to proceed with care. I take particular note of the comments of the member for Gellibrand with regard to the plague proportions and crisis proportions of AIDS and HIV. They are indeed very startling figures which he presented to the committee here tonight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The AusAid budget is a large budget, one carefully allocated and with a particular focus on countries in south Asia and other parts of Asia which are closer to home. That does not ignore completely the circumstances of Africa. As the member for Gellibrand has acknowledged, there is a continuing allocation, but it is one which he would like to see increased. I can only say that the government has, in the circumstances, done as much as it can do. Of course, we will continue to provide, through multilateral arrangements, additional aid with regard to HIV-AIDS worldwide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Turning to the comments of the member for Throsby, the closure of the Copenhagen and Nauru missions were difficult decisions, to be frank, and were ones which I know were carefully weighed by my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Alexander Downer, and myself and others before reaching that conclusion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of Copenhagen I would point out that there are posts elsewhere in Europe in Athens, Belgrade, Berlin, Bonn, Brussels, Budapest, Dublin, Holy See, London, Madrid, Malta, Moscow, Nicosia, Paris, Rome, Stockholm, The Hague, Vienna and Warsaw. Locating posts involves getting the right balance between various parts of the world and within various regions of the world. It was not a decision taken lightly. Governments, from time to time, close posts, and governments, from time to time, open posts. For example, we have picked up on your decision of a couple of years back to reopen Beirut in Lebanon and retain that post. It is an important post in the Middle East.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note his comments with regard to Radio Australia that an additional $4 million was supplied from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to recover in part the reductions in budget allocation to Radio Australia. Radio Australia does have an important role to play. The real enemies of Radio Australia, I have since discovered, rested in the senior echelons of the ABC. If it were not for elements within the ABC and their agenda against Radio Australia, we would not have been presented with the shutdown circumstance we were confronted with. However, we have dealt with that, turned it around, and we have provided now for a continuing operation of Radio Australia, albeit on a reduced scale.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, I commend the estimate to the committee. I thank the member for Gellibrand and the member for Throsby for their deeply held views which they presented to the committee tonight. I also say to members of the committee, especially as they examine the trade side of things, to study the trade outcomes and objectives statement which I tabled at the start of this year. It gives a very good overview of our trading circumstance and it has a statistical backup.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, first let me say that we do not accept that the budgetary position excuses the cut in aid. The budget deficit that was left by the former government was one of the lowest budget deficits in the Western developed world, as was the level of government debt; and neither of those circumstances in any way justify cutting aid to people in tremendous need.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have a bit more time now, I want to refer to a particular cut that was made in the budget in relation to a program which was advertised to non&hyphen;government organisations last August. It was called the ANGOP, which I think is the African and non&hyphen;government organisations program, and it has now been axed. But in February 1997, AusAID wrote to the Australian NGOs requesting project ideas by mid&hyphen;April for a program that it had announced after last year's budget. They received 48 proposals. All the NGOs acted in good faith and put a great deal of effort and planning into the proposals. This work was matched by others in Africa, where communities and their leaders had also done a lot of work discussing and planning the types of projects which would respond to the needs of local communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">AusAID was due to announce the successful projects in the week after the budget was brought down. However, the NGO representatives were told, as part of a briefing on the night of the budget, that the program had been cancelled as a result of budget cuts. So a program was announced at the time of the last budget. Everyone worked like hell on it from August last year to May this year, and on the night of the budget they were told that all that was a waste, it was gone. This was not only work by people in the NGOs here in Australia, with their scarce resources allocated to working up good projects, but also work by people in Africa who had been very much involved in trying to work up those projects so that they were good, decent projects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">World Vision has said that six of their projects have been axed as a result of the wiping of the scheme. They were: in Ethiopia, a project to improve the health of 41,000 people through clean water and improved sanitation; in Malawi, a project to provide HIV/AIDS education and home based care support to 62,000 people; in Malawi, a project to improve seed supply and to increase farm yields and food security for 30,000 people; in Uganda, a project to help 10,000 people affected by HIV/AIDS; in Mozambique, a project to improve the health of 20,000 people by improving water supply and sanitation facilities; and, in Mozambique, another project to improve the health of 37,000 people through improved water supply and sanitation facilities.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question goes to trade and the emergence of the Internet as a potential market for small business in the country and in my electorate. One of the inhibitors of small business and commerce on the Internet is the concerns that consumers have about the security of commercial transactions. It is relatively easy for an informed Net nerd to intercept e&hyphen;mails and commercial transactions. This has led to a serious concern and a lack of consumer confidence in commercial transactions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Into this problem area emerges a company called Nexus, which has developed an encryption product which has been widely recognised in the industry as second to none. It is a 448&hyphen;bit key encryption product which takes about 2,000 to 3,000 years to decrypt using a high&hyphen;end conventional PC. Such an excellent encryption product has caused security organisations some concern, because it infringes on their assumed right to peruse the personal e&hyphen;mails and transactions of citizens. Consequently, the government has refused to award Nexus an export licence after the company had landed a very significant contract with the World Health Organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Frankly, it is beyond me to know why the Australian government feels it necessary for their intelligence organisation to have the capability of inspecting the internal e&hyphen;mails of the World Health Organisation. Nonetheless, it goes beyond a debate simply about whether intelligence organisations should be able to decrypt the private e&hyphen;mails of citizens in Australia to citizens elsewhere. This is a debate about whether people have confidence in the Internet as a forum for commercial transactions. Australia has one of the highest take&hyphen;up rates of technology in the world. Because of that, arguably, Australian business stands to lose the most, because of the lack of consumer confidence in the Internet as a vehicle for doing business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My concern with what has happened to this particular company with their product goes beyond simply the disadvantage caused to this company by the limiting of the export of its product. It goes to the potential that Australian business has of exploiting the emerging 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5495"> opportunities presented on the Internet. This particular company, apart from being denied an export licence, asked what it would take to get permission to sell its product to Australian government departments. It was told that, if its software were vetted by an organisation, it could go on the list. The government has outsourced the vetting process to a private sector company&mdash;coincidentally, a company which also engages in the marketing of encryption software. It eventuates that the company that also markets encryption software has said that it will take a great deal of time to assess this particular company's software and that will cost the very small business in Australia some $250,000. This is a small business that is trying to pitch a product at under $250 per unit per twin&hyphen;site licence. So, in that environment, you have a small business that really has to do better than a company like BHP to make itself worth while.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To add insult to injury, in the system that the government is asking this company to go through, it is required to hand over its source code to the American private sector company&mdash;to vet it on behalf of the Australian government! Quite a situation, clearly, and one that is not sustainable. In my view, it is inconsistent with the self&hyphen;professed ideology of members opposite that talks about the rights of the individual&mdash;the rights to privacy, the rights to individual freedoms and so on.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to express briefly my concern about the climate change debate in Australia and Australia's attitude to it internationally. Whilst I realise that the meetings that will happen very soon, following the G7 meeting and the so&hyphen;called Rio II, will not necessarily lock everybody in, they are very important in the run&hyphen;up to the Kyoto conference in December.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to get the balance right. I acknowledge that this has to be a whole&hyphen;of&hyphen;government approach to a fairly important question, but I also note that on page 52 of the portfolio budget statement of the department it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Directions and outcomes of key international environment negotiations which safeguard or advance Australian economic, environmental and other interests . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">When we talk about `other interests' in this debate, we should not just talk about trade and industry interests alone; we should balance them against not only the world's environmental interests, but also Australia's environmental interests because, as I have said before, the environmental problems that the world has know no geopolitical boundaries. We have to keep that in consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing I wish to touch upon briefly&mdash;and I know that the Acting Prime Minister, in his capacity as the Minister for Trade, has made his views pretty clear on this&mdash;is social clauses in trade agreements, whether they be multilateral agreements or bilateral agreements. Australia's role is to show leadership on these questions. It is in Australia's interests to develop some of these questions through trade agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One social matter that I have raised from time to time in this place is the question of child labour. This is a difficult problem for a number of countries within which child labour is practised. It is a very important problem for the economies of families and the like, but this is something on which Australia, in the best interests of Australia as a nation, needs to show leadership.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis), the member for Fraser (Mr Dargavel) and the member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) for their additional contributions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to NGOs, I advise the member for Gellibrand that additional funds of $3 million have been allocated to the AusAID NGO cooperation program, whereby government funds are used to subsidise the fundraising of the NGOs. This represents a real increase of 17 per cent, or nearly 20 per cent in nominal terms, on that aspect of the equation. I am honest enough to say that that is only a very small aspect, because total funding available to NGOs in the next budget will decrease to around $88 million, compared with $102 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, AusAID expenditure is still maintained at $1.4 billion. That is a fairly big&hyphen;ticket item in a budget which has to be carefully weighed on all items. This is overseas expenditure. I often find myself in a hall having to argue about why we give any foreign aid. There is a great deal of logic, quite apart from humanitarian reasons, as to why we give foreign aid, and I will always defend a sensible, efficient, and effective foreign aid program. However, I take particular note of the member for Gellibrand's comments and they will be referred to AusAID.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to the member for Fraser, I invite him to give the names of the companies in respect of export and the Internet matter to Mr David Crook, an officer from Austrade who is here tonight. We will try to follow up that issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to the member for Scullin, I value his comments. On climate change, the tide has actually been turning a little in the last few days. A report in the United States from the energy department is putting a more realistic tilt on the whole business of uniform targets which elements of Europe and the United States would seek to impose, and which would so disadvantage our GDP and coal jobs in the Hunter Valley, Central Queensland and elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased that when I went to the OECD Energy Ministers' Conference we persuaded the Europeans to sign up to a communique which says that targets should be achievable and realistic and take into account each country's particular circumstance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course the environment of the planet earth is a fragile circumstance; of course it extends beyond national boundaries. Yes, we will make a genuine and cooperative effort towards Kyoto and an achievement of something that is going to be practical, realistic and something which will engage the developing countries, not just the developed countries&mdash;and that is also a part of getting the equation right. But I am not and the federal government is not of a mind to go down some suicide economic path which in turn would ultimately add to the greenhouse gas emissions problem. We must carefully weigh this. We are proceeding to fight and put forward our diplomatic representations and, in fact, we are gaining some support. Recently, Norway has joined with Australia and hopefully there are others to come.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the social causes and child labour, it is unacceptable that in the 1990s anywhere in the world there is slave child labour with its horrific abuse of children. I must say that I feel most strongly about it as did Michael Duffy, a former minister, who was part of a report which was completed just at the change of government last year. But we have the International Labour Organisation (ILO). I know the minister follows Geneva with interest and I am pleased to see 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5497"> the Minister for Industrial Relations here. I actually looked up their budget the other day. I called for a one-page summary of their budget. The ILO budget is in excess of half a billion US dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My beef simply is that there is an organisation called the International Labour Organisation and it should get on with the task of doing, among other things, all that it ought to be doing with regard to child labour. I do not believe that it sits happily in the World Trade Organisation arena. The correct way to carry it forward is in the ILO and I have discussed this previously with the Minister for Industrial Relations. I nevertheless agree that this abuse of children anywhere in the 1990s is absolutely unacceptable as is the fact that the Internet is being abused for child pornography purposes. Again, that was pursued by Foreign Affairs and Trade and by me in the OECD setting just two weeks ago. I do thank members for their thoughtful contributions to this estimates debate for Foreign Affairs and Trade. I believe that on balance, the budget and its allocations are fair but there is a challenge and that is to get the most effective use of all the taxpayers' dollars allocated.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In my main budget speech I detailed several aspects of the rural scene that demanded urgent attention from this government and which were not addressed in the budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Happily, the government has seen fit to extend exceptional circumstances coverage for an additional three months for those whose coverage was due to run out in early June. However, with a new or a renewed drought hitting the tablelands of New South Wales and other parts of Australia, despite some recent falls there will be no pasture growth this winter and precious little run&hyphen;off. Despite this help there needs to be a further review of this three months assistance and, in the longer term, I support the views of New South Wales Farmers Association which is not prepared to endorse any wholesale modifications to the overall drought assistance measures until full details are available which provide for transitional arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The farm sector is looking forward to the government's integrated rural policy package to be announced later this year which was forecast in the budget. The rhetoric is fine but the delivery of this package is vital to achieve its aims and I certainly hope such lofty aims will be achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me quote from the budget papers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The integrated policy package will draw upon several reviews of Commonwealth rural policy undertaken recently and the government will consult with stakeholders, industry groups and states before finalising elements of the policy later in the year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The objective of this package is to promote a self&hyphen;reliant productive rural sector supported by targeted government measures which focus on building the skills and capacity of rural industries and communities to manage effectively in an uncertain environment.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The environment is certainly uncertain. I notice that the National Rural Finance Summit Activating Committee will have an input into this package.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the main chamber the other night, I mentioned the plight of farmers in my electorate faced with a lending regime of banks that are charging usury rates, denying access to small business 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5498"> loans, and certainly not helping build the skills of participants in this part of rural industry. These views were aired by farmers, small businessmen and rural councillors at the Bathurst Bank Forum last Wednesday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There must be alternative avenues for farm finance and the government must be proactive in supporting such measures and, if necessary, underwriting where proposals are sound. It is one thing to talk about self&hyphen;reliance in the farming sector; it is another to expect the farm sector to carry all the risks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sort of support I envisage is tax breaks, rebates or credits for farmers for drought&hyphen;proofing properties or for those contractors involved in such provisions as haymaking. The Premier of New South Wales suggested this idea to the Prime Minister recently. That is interesting, as I provided Mr Carr with a copy of my first speech in this parliament&mdash;at his request&mdash;which included that very idea. It may not have been original, but I suspect that is where the Premier got the idea, and I am happy to share it with him and anyone else. I also hope the rural package to be announced later this year addresses the farm assets question for an intergenerational transfer of farms because that, too, is continuing to cause hardship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The supermarket to Asia strategy means nothing if we do not help improve the infrastructure to export our produce. It is interesting to note the recent unveiling of the ABARE export potential for inland New South Wales, which was delivered with more of a fizz than a fanfare in Parkes recently by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Brownhill, telling the inland councils what they knew already&mdash;the enormous potential for export from inland New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Was it, I wonder, a bit of catching&hyphen;up by a government that has failed to support the concept of a fresh food export airport at Parkes, to which over 30 inland New South Wales councils are committed&mdash;an inland marketing concept now three years old where the Inland Marketing Corporation has already researched the potential? It did not need ABARE to spell it out for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The feasibility study which is now being completed&mdash;paid for by Parkes Council, with help from the New South Wales government&mdash;is likely to show not only that the inland marketing concept, airport included, is viable, but that it has enormous potential to generate wealth and employment for inland New South Wales, its towns and its farmers alike. Is it any wonder that this government, which reneged on its election commitment to support the study, is furiously trying to catch up and claim some ownership of those statistics when they are published?</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Calare (Mr Andren) for his contribution. As is so often the case, it appears that there are not a lot of people with a great deal of interest in this particular&mdash;and I think, vitally important&mdash;portfolio and the things that it touches on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the circumstances, I will confine myself to brief remarks about some of the issues that the honourable member raised. He talked about exceptional circumstances and our recent brief extension of some three months of the drought relief payment to those for whom it was to end on 10 June. He indicated that he hoped that the integrated rural policy package would address a wide range of needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make the point that the integrated rural package is something that we have been working on for quite a while. It does indeed draw on the work of a large number of reviews but putting the thing together is extraordinarily difficult. On the one hand, we have a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5499"> responsibility to be compassionate to farm families who cannot meet their needs. On the other hand, we do not want to continue to create an environment in which much of the spirit of resilience, independence and innovation that has made the rural sector in this country so great is undermined. Finding the right balance is not easy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say at the outset that one of the other major reports that we are drawing on makes it plain that, despite some of the anecdotal evidence to the contrary, there is currently prevailing no failure of availability of farm finance to the rural sector. Businesses that have a future are able to draw on borrowings or on debt equity, if that is the way they choose to finance themselves&mdash;and, indeed, having been very closely involved with this portfolio for a long time, I must say that that has been my experience.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a welcome change. It is unquestionably different from the situation which prevailed during the times of extraordinarily high interest rates that we saw under the previous regime. I make the point, too, that of far more value than interest rate subsidies&mdash;which, of course, we announced in the budget that we would no longer continue with&mdash;is a regime under which interest rates fall for everyone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a general rule of thumb, only around six per cent of farmers at any given time were receiving interest rate subsidies or business support under normal RAS. It was always difficult to target and it was always hard to make it fair. There were always people who, by the criteria, should probably have been getting assistance but were not, and there were those who were getting assistance but who did not need or deserve that assistance. It is far better to get interest rates down for everyone, to develop a level playing field in which all can have the opportunity to maximise their performance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that regard I want to say that, firstly, the government's fiscal consolidation objectives are plainly reaping benefits for farmers, but perhaps they were grossly underestimated. Some people talk a great deal about the $40 million&hyphen;odd that went into interest rate subsidies. The interest rates cuts that we have seen since this government came to power just 15 months ago are worth some $350 million to $400 million to the whole of the farm sector. Those cuts are extraordinarily valuable: they are the key to stabilising debt and the key to recovery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note with a great deal of pleasure that farm debt in some sectors is now being wound back. Unfortunately, that is not true of the troubled beef sector and, at this stage, it is still not the case in the recovering wool industry. But many other sectors, including grain, appear to be not only starting to reinvest but also winding back debt levels, albeit not at a high rate; nonetheless, that is a very welcome development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The integrated rural policy package will deal with a wide range of issues, including a more streamlined, equitable and less ad hoc approach to farm welfare. It will also deal more effectively with the business needs of farmers: training, skills, benchmarking, marketing skills and more effective savings mechanisms such as IEDs, farm management bonds and those sorts of things. Finally, let me say that the supermarket to Asia program is an important one. If only it were as simple as being a matter of infrastructure; but it is not. It is about constantly upgrading Australia's approach to food safety, quality, packaging and marketing, if we are to achieve our objective of being a premier supplier of quality foodstuffs to our increasingly able&hyphen;to&hyphen;pay Asian neighbours.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the banking summit in Bathurst last week, a rural councillor gave an example of farmers who were trying to access small business loans at 7.9 per cent being turned away by the major banks and told that in fact they were not a small 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5500"> business. The asset backing these farmers were offering was in terms of land which was close to Sydney and had the potential for subdivision by the banks should they need, down the track, to foreclose&mdash;which many have the tendency to do&mdash;yet they were asked to pay 11&half; per cent overdraft rates and a one per cent service fee. They are also penalised a percentage point now by one major bank because they are under suspicion of having Ovine Johne's disease. If that is an example of supporting the farm sector to try to trade out of difficulty, given that it still has an asset backing, I do not believe that the financial sector is in any way supportive of the rural sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one other point I would like to make and that is that any jobs for the dole program, which I would prefer to see called Jobs Australia, should include a farm employment scheme. It should have an adequate training component involving two to three days a week at award rates perhaps, and be aimed at backing up the family farm. Such a program would offer the lone farmer the flexibility he or she needs to climb back to prosperity and get those basic jobs done that are desperately needed, like weed control, that has not been looked at in many months. I am thinking here of some of the serrated tussock problems on the tablelands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At present, farmers cannot get out on the three&hyphen;wheeler to do the work. Apart from the cost of the chemicals, they need the labour assistance. They need that farm help that they once had. They will still be viable if they can get that bit of help. I see this as perhaps one program that the National Farmers Federation and local farming groups could pick up and promote as an idea that can make a positive contribution to the work for the dole program. It will be help the family farm and at the same time soak up some of the 30 per cent plus of the keen, and very skilled in some cases, young, rural unemployed.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that I would just say that after many years of dealing in this area, knowing it inside out, I say to you to look very closely at the real circumstances in each of these cases. I often have them bowled up to me but when you look at them you find that perhaps their equity is extremely low or that they really have no management system in place, or that perhaps it is not a genuine farming operation. I have to say to you that it is my experience that a farmer who can demonstrate that he or she is competently running a business, that they have some equity left, that they have a prospect of trading, can secure loans that are fully equivalent to, in every way, loans that are offered to the small business sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I raise that point because it is very important for farmers to recognise that the old days of great loyalty to banks and expecting that loyalty to be reciprocated and what have you, are gone. Farmers ought to be prepared to bargain. They have to be prepared to shop around. They have to be prepared to thump the table and sell their own case. In those circumstances I think that the overwhelming bulk of farmers today ought to be able to secure loans below 10 per cent. If there is evidence to the contrary, that would be most useful for me as I seek to represent the rural sector. I make that offer in good faith. That wraps up all I had to say.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to use this opportunity to raise my concern about some issues that emerged in the budget papers, and most particularly have emerged in the Senate estimates committee consideration of those budget papers. They relate in particular to the relative funding and role of the Office of the Employment Advocate compared to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and what it reflects in terms of the priority of the government in comparing the significance of Australian workplace agreements to awards and other agreements which go through the Australian Industrial Relations Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have in this budget increased resources for the Office of the Employment Advocate and reduced resources for the Industrial Relations Commission. On the face of it there is a budget notation which indicates increased resources for the Industrial Relations Commission to discharge the extra functions that it has achieved as a result of the amalgamation with Victoria. However, as the Senate estimates committee process made clear when questioning the Registrar of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, when, if I can put it in the vernacular, the ons and offs are taken into account, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission is substantially worse off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The registrar says the net result is about a $300,000 reduction in the running costs appropriation. Given the increased responsibilities of the commission as it relates to the handover in Victoria, that is a cause of concern to me. There was an unwelcome hiatus in the provision of resources to support workers and small business people seeking assistance from what was traditionally done by the Victorian government through Wageline, but I welcome the fact that there is now funding for that. That is, I assume, to be covered by this increased funding, but the cuts that flow with that to the resources of the Industrial Relations Commission make it less able to discharge that obligation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I make that comment only as a backdrop. My particular concern is the role of the Office of the Employment Advocate. Of course, everybody knows, I assume, or at least those involved in this debate know, that the opposition's position is essentially that it is an office that should not exist. Half of its function should be performed by the Industrial Relations Commission and could be better done there and some should be done by the department. But that is irrelevant to this discussion. My concern is about the way that it is functioning and about the evidence that is emerging about the Australian workplace agreements for which it is responsible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The evidence before the estimates committee indicates an organisation operating in a bizarre fashion. I think the Employment Advocate thinks he is actually the Director&hyphen;General of ASIO rather than the head of the Office of the Employment Advocate. He has undercover people running around, but only pursuing matters to do with freedom of association. There is no evidence at all of any spot&hyphen;check or any activity about any employees concerned about any Australian workplace agreement. He is refusing to disclose to the parliament the most basic information that should be supplied in the interests of accountability to the parliament. He refused to supply the 11 Australian workplace agreements that he has approved, even though we all accept that he would need to delete all the identifying information to conform with the act. There is no argument about that.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5502">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But even if you think there is some reason why he might be entitled to refuse that to the parliament&mdash;and I do not think there is any&mdash;how on earth can he justify refusing to make available the guidelines upon which he is making his decisions? All sorts of cases that have been argued over the years in the various courts and tribunals in Australia have made it clear that taxpayers and citizens are entitled to have access to the guidelines upon which decisions affecting their rights and entitlements are based. Not only is this Employment Advocate not prepared to make them public, he is not prepared even to release them to the parliament. We have this gentleman seeking to run an undercover operation hoping to deny accountability to the parliament in the way that is available only to the nation's security organisations. It is entirely inappropriate. It is an action by a public official the like of which I have not seen before, having had all too many experiences with Senate estimates committees in the past, which I do not miss one bit. But I have never seen anybody behaving in the manner that this gentleman did and it gives me great concern about the way the office is operating. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In regards to the consideration in detail, I would like to respond to a number of the things that the shadow minister has said so that the record is quite clear, particularly in respect of the Office of the Employment Advocate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first general background point he made was that there is something sinister to be derived from an examination of the funding for the Office of the Employment Advocate and the Industrial Relations Commission.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, and you then say it is sinister and a reflection of priorities with which you do not agree. But in respect of the funding for the Industrial Relations Commission, clearly, the role of the commission is changing. We have made no secret of that. You talked about its responsibilities. The fact of the matter is that over time you are seeing an evolution where its responsibilities are changing and affecting its workload, not just as a result of the Victorian transfer, but as a result of the operations of the Workplace Relations Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In many areas the commission will have less work than it has had in the past&mdash;for example, obviously in respect of unfair dismissals but also in some of the general work that the commission undertakes. But the government continues to support the commission. We continue to ensure that it is appropriately funded. It does have a very important task ahead of it, a task defined by the Workplace Relations Act. One of its essential tasks is to maintain a credible safety net for employees who are reliant upon the award system to provide them with base protections.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been no hiatus, shall I say, in the delivery of services in Victoria. We had a seamless transition from the Victorian government's operations to the new Commonwealth operation. By doing so in a very cooperative manner with the Victorian government, we continue to maintain services. Yes, there have been savings there but they come from rationalising the two services into one and I think that is in everybody's interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of the operations of the Office of the Employment Advocate, I think it would have been also fair for the shadow minister to put as a background to his comments about the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5503"> advocate that the Labor Party had been totally opposed to the establishment of the Office of the Employment Advocate.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Everything you say about the advocate is in fact coloured by your views about whether or not we should have an office of employment advocate. For example, you make this extraordinary and, I must say, not becoming comment that you have never seen anything like the performance of the advocate before the Senate committee. In fact, you misrepresented what happened before the Senate committee. He did not say that he was not prepared to produce certain documents. He said that, before he produced anything, he needed to first take legal advice as to what his obligations were under the Workplace Relations Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How can you accuse a public servant of refusing to be accountable to the parliament when what he was saying was that he wants proper legal advice as to what his obligations are? That is what he said. The record is quite clear on that. To say that he is in some way attempting to refuse to participate or to respond to the questions that were put to him is, quite frankly, a gross misrepresentation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What some of your colleagues in the Senate wanted was the disclosure of Australian workplace agreements when the policy intention of this parliament is quite clear, and that is that that documentation is to be confidential to the parties unless they decide otherwise. I think it is a quite unreasonable attack for you to mount against the advocate. By all means, you may have your disagreements about the Office of the Employment Advocate but why don't you run on those instead of these baseless, silly allegations you have been making? Sure, the unions do not like the fact that the advocate has certain functions given to him by the parliament to enforce the freedom of association provisions of the act, but that is no basis upon which you can mount the sort of attack that you have made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was one incident and in that one incident you have also been a party to the union's attack on the advocate. Some of the things have been a complete nonsense. He did not represent himself as a driver's assistant, which the TWU has been going around saying. There were no secretive, underhand tactics, which you have been endorsing out of the comments of the TWU. There was no intention to conceal his identity&mdash;that is another baseless allegation that was made. The fact of the matter is that he went to check the veracity of certain allegations made, which is a function the parliament has given him, and he acted legally and in an appropriate manner. So have your disagreements but keep to the facts. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to pursue that issue further, but I would like to take up two matters that were raised by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith). First, I seek information from him because his understanding of a matter of fact is different from mine, and I would be interested if he could give me the information&mdash;not necessarily this evening but subsequently&mdash;relating to the seamless handover in Victoria. I accept that in some ways that happened, but I have a particular concern with regard to the wage line activities, the information advisory service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My understanding from information that was given to me&mdash;information that I thought up until now was uncontradicted&mdash;is that the Victorian government's wage line activity ceased on 31 March and that the Australian government's activities to replace that did not commence until 1 July because there was no budget appropriation. I understood that to be the case. I have been advised by people who should have known that that was the case. I am not challenging in this instance the minister's word on that. I would be very interested to get the alternative 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5504"> information from him. He may not have it tonight, and it is not a matter of such controversy that I seek it this evening, but I would appreciate his information. It is not an issue of great controversy. I am just interested in the facts of that matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to his attack on me about the Employment Advocate, I made it clear this evening that, while I disagree with his view about the making available of Australian workplace agreements, that is a matter on which there is a possibility that there will be some contention. I accept that he has taken legal advice. I think he is wrong, but I accept that there could be some controversy about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question of whether guidelines for decision making should be available to the parliament is a well established matter going back four years. The possibility that they should not be made available seems to me, on the face of it, to be extraordinary. If there is some special circumstance in this matter, I will be fascinated to see what it is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point that leads me to rise for a second time is actually the substance of the Australian workplace agreements that are emerging from the shadow of secrecy with which the government tries to drape it. The Employment Advocate&mdash;and in this instance I will say to his credit&mdash;has before the Senate estimates committee made it absolutely clear that the so&hyphen;called rock solid guarantee that no&hyphen;one's take&hyphen;home pay would be cut is and always was meaningless and is not reflected in this legislation in any way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What he said quite explicitly and accurately is that you cannot get less than the award which covers your area. I actually think that in the way he is interpreting the act that is not going to be the case, but that is not my point. There will be some evidence about that subsequently and we will deal with that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But where people have been operating for years and years on the basis of agreements that operate over and above an award the guarantee that they will not lose their take home pay means nothing, because the no disadvantage test operates against the award, which may be hundreds of dollars less than the prior take&hyphen;home pay of the employees in question. After hearing the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) say they had a rock solid guarantee that no&hyphen;one could cut their take&hyphen;home pay, I am sure they would be surprised to find that this is what it means.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are already finding examples in the 11 Australian workplace agreements that have been approved so far of workers who are substantially&mdash;to the tune of hundreds of dollars a fortnight&mdash;worse off. This is not denied by the Employment Advocate. He simply says, correctly, that his responsibility is to judge these matters against the award, and he has determined they are not worse off against the award.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In one instance of which I am aware, I do not think he is correct but, as I say, that is not the point I am trying to make this evening. That will take more research before I establish whether I agree with his interpretation, and I will raise that on another occasion. There are many more concerns I have about Australian workplace agreements and about the way they are being reviewed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am amazed that up until now in none of the matters which the Employment Advocate has approved has he been in such doubt that he thought any of them needed to be referred to the Industrial Relations Commission for advice with regard to their compliance with the no disadvantage test. I am sure some of them are quite clear, and he gave an example in the Senate estimates which seems, on the face of it, to be quite clear, and there is no reason why he should refer such a case. But that none of them, including the two of which I am aware, created sufficient doubt in his mind to warrant a reference is a source of amazement to me.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5505">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am concerned about the pattern that is emerging of the impact of these Australian workplace agreements on the living standards of Australian men and women working under them.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The shadow minister, the member for Canberra (Mr McMullan) is looking for a trend but has no facts upon which to establish it. He says he is absolutely shocked that there has been no case of doubt as yet, but he can only draw from that some sinister inference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that&mdash;and it is relevant to his second last point&mdash;he is entitled to obtain undertakings from parties where he is not satisfied on the face of the documentation. I cannot give you the details of one of the agreements that you have been referring to, but I did notice from Work Force this morning that they claim that further undertakings were given in addition to the documentation, which is quite a nice little point because when you&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="McMULLAN" NAMEID="5I4">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. It is a nice little point because when you got very excited about what you claim were the first AWAs in Australia being at the casino, firstly, I am told that the first AWAs were not at the casino and, secondly, you did not have all the facts and you did not have all the documentation if Work Force is right. So all I say to you is: by all means, run your arguments, but see if you can get the facts, because you will have a better and more informed debate if you do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to say a few other things. Firstly, the member for Canberra began his speech by saying he would not pursue the issue of the OEA further. I am not sure what he meant by that, seeing we had a few other comments from him, but I am pleased that he said that. He wants some further information on the transfer of the wage line. My memory is that it closed one day and we opened it the next. I note that something was said, I think, in an estimates committee which raised the spectre of a gap. There was no gap, but let me confirm that with the member. That is my genuine understanding of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of the evidence that Mr Rowe gave to the Senate estimates committee, I am glad the member for Canberra now says that he accepts that Mr Rowe is taking legal advice. I think he should have said that, in fairness to him, the first time around. The member keeps referring to the guidelines. The fact is that one aspect of this is that they are not concluded guidelines, they are draft guidelines, and at this point in time Mr Rowe personally is approving all of the agreements. So they do not perhaps have the same longer term relevance that they will have once the operation is fully under way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, the honourable member referred to the guarantee that we gave. The guarantee that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) gave as the Leader of the Opposition in January 1996 was quite explicit: that people would not be disadvantaged against the award. The speech that he gave to the Young Liberals on 8 January is quite explicit. There has never been any question about it. In fact, the only time we had some controversy about it was in a very neat response to say that this was a no&hyphen;disadvantage test against the award. In fact, it is the opposition's no&hyphen;disadvantage test. By and large, we have made it more flexible and, in a sense, it operates better. Those opposite had a no&hyphen;disadvantage test against the award. We have a no&hyphen;disadvantage test against the award. I think we have made it a better one in terms of flexibility and the like, but the basic concept has not changed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Are people entitled to have a no&hyphen;disadvantage test against what they were last earning, which was the honourable member's proposition? Our response to that in the 1996 election was: 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5506"> `Well, we're not going to give Paul Keating a guarantee that he'll be earning as much after the election as what he was before the election, because his circumstances will have changed.' The guarantee has always been very clear: a no&hyphen;disadvantage test against the award. I do not know why you would find it such a deficient no&hyphen;disadvantage test when, for years, you were in fact in support of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude by thanking the shadow minister for his contribution. I presume he has completed his remarks. I will be happy to confirm what I have said to him in respect of the seamless transition from Victoria to the Commonwealth in respect of the wage line.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In dealing with this area of the budget, I take the opportunity to make a few observations about the recent announcement made by BHP to cease primary steel production in Newcastle in September 1999. BHP established the steelworks in Newcastle in 1915. Since that time Newcastle has become very clearly and very firmly established as a steel producing centre, and the character of Newcastle since that time has always been identified in relation to steel production.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think this particular issue illustrates better than most other developments the general attitude of this government to issues of this kind. Steel making is a core activity in Newcastle and is recognised to be so. Despite the fact that BHP proposes to cease primary steel production in September 1999, the response of the government, first of all from the office of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), was that the Prime Minister would hear any submissions in connection with that issue but he would not intervene.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We did not expect the Prime Minister to go to Newcastle and demand that BHP steel production continue. We did not expect that to be the form of intervention. But we did expect the Prime Minister to act as a Prime Minister. The response of the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) was that we have to accept the realities of the world market. The world market is such that the demand for steel is expanding. BHP, as a major Australian corporation, could have taken advantage of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the fact that 2,500 people will lose their jobs and 2,500 families will be disadvantaged directly, and in excess of 6,000 individuals and families at least will be disadvantaged indirectly, Mr Moore said, nevertheless, that it was a good day for BHP shares. I did not hear that said, Mr Deputy Speaker, but I have heard it reported; and I have not heard it denied. I am disappointed and disgusted if that was said. It was a good day for BHP shares and for BHP shareholders, and that just shows how crazy this whole position is. Within hours, the value of BHP shares increased by $1 billion as a result of the announcement that it would cease steel making in Newcastle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1983, the Labor government inherited an industrial graveyard in Australia. Industry was inefficient and uncompetitive. The proportion of manufactured goods which we exported was relatively small. During the 13 years that Labor was in government that situation was turned around completely. That was largely as a result of the very dramatic restructuring which took place in the framework of industry in Australia to make it possible for Australian industry to become competitive and to export to a greater extent than it had before.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5507">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At that time, in 1983, there was a possibility that primary steel production in Australia would cease altogether. As a result of that, the Labor Party in opposition before 1983 put together what we identified as a steel plan. We said that within 100 days of coming into government the steel plan would be put into operation. It took a little bit longer than 100 days, but it was put into operation. Taxpayers' funds of $90 million went into downstream users of steel. As a result of that, it was possible for us to encourage from BHP a major commitment to continue investment in steel production in Australia. I am pleased to say that, until relatively recently, BHP honoured those commitments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The decision that BHP has now made was made despite the fact that the former Labor government had a commitment from BHP, as recently as 1995, that it would continue steel production in Newcastle, it would invest $200 million, and it would, if necessary, put in an electric arc furnace in order to ensure that steel production would continue in Newcastle until at least 2002. I will take an opportunity shortly to add further to these remarks. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to take the opportunity offered by the presence of the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr McGauran) at this debate to raise the future of the CSIRO research facility at Narayen near Mundubbera. Mundubbera is in my electorate, but Narayen is actually just across the border in the electorate of Hinkler. This has been a longstanding research station on a very large property watered by a fine river system, and it is certainly an excellent property.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has a fine group of buildings, now mostly several decades old, an excellent airstrip and so it is well serviced as a property of quality, and a property which has the capacity to offer a facility for research in a wide variety of areas. It has traditionally been working in pasture research.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Its future has come into question because the Beef Research Committee and, indeed, the beef industry as a whole are suggesting that there are other higher priorities now for industry research than pastures. Many people in the industry disagree with that assessment and believe that it is still very important to the grazing industry for beef producers to have available to them a research facility that can do work on developing the best possible pastures and appropriate management of such pastures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The facility has also played a major role in the development of the Belmont Red breed of cattle and has been involved in quite a deal of other work. Because the native pastures have been significantly improved as part of the pasture research, even though it is a large property, it has been necessary over recent times to lease some surrounding land to undertake some of their work. But the CSIRO have given no indication at this stage as to what the future of that research facility will be and the staff are naturally anxious about their future. The facility has been steadily wound down over recent years and the staff are also disappointed that the CSIRO has not given them an opportunity to undertake research in other areas. On a number of occasions they have put together proposals to undertake particular activities and these have not been taken up by CSIRO management. So it is not just a matter of the funding coming from industry sources; it is also a question as to whether there is any longer a commitment from the CSIRO to make effective use of this facility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even if it is decided that, for one reason or another, there is no longer a future role for pasture research, then the property would have potential for quite a deal of other activities. For instance, it is in one of the most successful citrus growing areas in Australia, perhaps in the world. While there have been problems with the citrus industry in southern states, in the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5508"> central Burnett the citrus industry has progressed in leaps and bounds, has opened up fantastic new markets in Asia, and has enormous potential. This area could potentially be used for citrus research.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also quite a lot of interest in planting vineyards and other small crops, various fruit trees and the like, so the opportunity would be there to use this property for that kind of work. It is a versatile property. As I have mentioned, it is well watered and it has some good quality agricultural land, though it is mainly a grazing property. For all those reasons, it does offer considerable potential for future use for scientific research. The property contributes significantly to its own revenue and could contribute more if it was able to operate on a more commercial basis. Their stud cattle are in high demand, but they could also produce cattle commercially on a much more extensive scale than happens at present.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure that the staff and the people of Mundubbera and Eidsvold would welcome a visit from the minister at some stage&mdash;hopefully, fairly soon&mdash;so that he can see the property first&hyphen;hand. It has a fine airstrip, so he could fly in without delaying his schedule too much. I am sure he would be impressed not only with the quality of the property, but with the dedication of the staff and the way in which they have undertaken their activities. This research facility is very strongly supported by the Mundubbera and Eidsvold communities, their shire councils, the local graziers and the farm organisations, who are all very keen to see its future secured. I would encourage the minister to visit the property soon and to provide a new role for the Narayen research facility to secure its future for the people of the area.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to address budget paper No. 4, for the Department of Industry, Science and Tourism and the section Grants&hyphen;in&hyphen;aid, which refers expressly to grants&hyphen;in&hyphen;aid to the Franchising Code Administration Council. If you look at that expenditure item, you will see that it is precisely zero. That is because this government has withdrawn, from 1996, funding for the Franchising Code Administration Council, the body set up by the previous government to administer the self&hyphen;regulatory code of practice established for franchising in 1993.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After the government withdrew this grant&hyphen;in&hyphen;aid, the council received legal and accounting advice that it could not be confident of its solvency under the new funding arrangements. It appointed an administrator and ceased trading so in fact it is now out of business. Further to that, the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser) rejected the calls by a parliamentary committee which conducted extensive research into this area for legislation to regulate the franchise sector. The Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs said that, in his view, an industry code of conduct would be the best way to resolve disputes between franchisors and their franchise operators. He further said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">People are missing the fact there are a whole lot of fairly successful franchise operations out there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has got to be mindful not to put in place any arrangement that would in any way disadvantage these successful operations.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The House of Representatives inquiry into fair trading in Australia drew attention to the fact that unfair practices in franchising have been a source of concern for some time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The inquiry noted that the Franchising Code Council, for the period from May to November of last year, received 123 formal complaints and an additional 2,500 inquiries. We further find that the Franchising Code disputes review received a submission from the Australian Franchisee Association saying that it had taken action against 32 franchisors on behalf of 53 franchisees. Once again that is very strong evidence of the extent of concern in this area.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5509">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee was able to establish that franchising contracts typically impose very heavy obligations on franchisees, while leaving franchisors' duties relatively undefined. It also points out that the obligations of the franchisor are vital to the franchising relationship and that these contracts, and the fact that franchisees have sunk costs into the venture, necessarily involve the danger of opportunistic abuse. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The incentive that causes a business with sunk costs to stay in operation despite losses makes franchisees vulnerable to franchisor behaviour known as `opportunism'. Because the franchisee will continue to operate even if it is not recovering its sunk investments, the franchisor can make decisions that induce such losses without the franchisee going out of business. When these decisions benefit the franchisor at the expense of the franchisee, the franchisor opportunistically extracts a portion of the franchisee's sunk costs.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Similarly, the Business Law Committee of the Law Institute of Victoria provided examples of abuses in this area. They include rolling audits of the franchisee to gather evidence of the franchisee's non compliance, and in site specific franchises taking advantage of the franchisee's development of its economic area to force the franchisee to pay goodwill again for its business by threatening to open new stores nearby.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of these things added up to the committee making a recommendation that the Commonwealth should enact specific franchising legislation, providing for compulsory registration of franchisors and compliance with codes of practice. This is something that the House urgently needs to consider. We need change. If we look at the bankruptcy figures for recent months, we will find that bankruptcy has risen in excess of 20 per cent. The vitality and lifeblood is being drained out of small business. Small businesses in this country are bleeding to death. It is my concern that this is because they have, in the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs, effectively put Dracula in charge of the blood bank.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is almost inconceivable that Australia would be contemplating at the present time the end of primary steel production because that is really what this announcement amounts to. At this point in time, Newcastle is being targeted. There is very little question that Whyalla will follow, and other centres of steel production in Australia could well be in the firing line.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some people might think that BHP is no longer investing in steel production. That would be wrong, because BHP is in the process of investing a total package of about $1 billion, but not in Australia. All of that $1 billion is going towards investment in steel production in other countries. All the capital investment is overseas; the job creation is overseas; the technology development is overseas; the development of export potential is overseas; and the infrastructure development is overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The income being generated by the big Australian will be overseas because it has now decided that it is time to abandon Newcastle and the people of Newcastle. As I said, there will be 2,500 jobs lost in the first instance, another 1,500 on&hyphen;site contract jobs and at least another 3,000 to 4,000 jobs upon which those people in the rest of Newcastle are dependent will also go&mdash;a minimum of about 7,000 jobs; 7,000 workers and 7,000 families affected. BHP said, `We're pulling the plug. We'll invest $1 billion, but we won't invest it here.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We expect more from the national government. Government is not about sitting on your hands, as this government has been doing, and waiting for BHP to get in touch with you, as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has said. Leadership is about getting on the phone and calling these people together so that an opportunity can be taken to ask, `What are the options? What can we do? What are your intentions?' That is not what is happening at the present time. The whole thing is an absolute disgrace!</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5510">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor had a steel plan when we came into government in 1983, and it was put into operation. At the time, there were 9,000 employees in steel production in Newcastle. As a result of our steel plan there was a major increase in productivity, which was encouraged and supported admirably by the unions and the work force. From 9,000 people directly involved in steel production in Newcastle the figure has been gradually reduced to what it is at the present time, to about 3,000. Those changes were gradual and were absorbed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was an output of about 160 tonnes of steel per employee in Newcastle in 1983. They were told that it had to be 500 tonnes per employee, otherwise steel production could be under threat. They passed through the 500 tonnes target and reached 650 tonnes per employee; it is now about 700 tonnes per employee, and they have been told that if steel production is to continue in Australia it needs to be 1,000 tonnes per employee. We know exactly what the implications of all of this are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said it before: government is about taking positive action and taking the initiative. It is also about responding to individual, family and community concerns. Just a week ago we had one of a number of gatherings in Newcastle to which the Prime Minister and the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) were both invited. They sent the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles). I say nothing against the member for La Trobe. He was courageous, and he was treated with every courtesy. But at that meeting we had present the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), the shadow minister for industry, the member for Hotham (Mr Crean), the President of the ACTU, two bishops, four federal Labor members, six state Labor members, the Lord Mayor and over 1,000 citizens. Yet the Prime Minister and the industry minister could not be there: they sent a backbench member of the government, the member for La Trobe&mdash;who, as I said, was treated with every courtesy by those people whose future is threatened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the sort of thing that we are getting from this government. That is the sort of thing that the Australian nation is getting from this government. The Australian people are becoming increasingly aware of just what that decision in March of last year meant. I said when I started that Newcastle illustrates it well. Newcastle does illustrate it well, and Newcastle's reaction will illustrate the reaction of the Australian people.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The contribution that we have just heard from the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) underlines the regional importance of proper industry policy. Those who have studied the Newcastle region know that what is really required is to put in place industry policies that take into account the effect on that region.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Likewise, although the electorate that I represent is part of metropolitan Melbourne, in the northern suburbs of Melbourne there are two areas where there has been real need and real concern about the direction of this government with regard to industry policy. The areas are, of course, the automotive industry&mdash;the passenger vehicle assembly sector&mdash;and the textiles, clothing and footwear industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we take the total number of jobs in the northern and western suburbs of Melbourne that are in those two industries, the decisions that are made by government have a great effect in a regional sense. And whilst sometimes that is clouded when you talk about regions within a metropolis like Melbourne, it is still very important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the disappointing aspects of the past 15 months or so of the government is the confusion that we see within this government on industry policy. If we look at the debate that we had over bounties&mdash;the backflips that we saw in the shipbuilding bounty, the backflips we 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5511"> saw on the robotic bounty and the backflips on the book bounty&mdash;it is of real concern that businesses in those sectors cannot really sit down and plan right through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last week I had a meeting, in conjunction with the honourable member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), with some of the people who are involved in the automotive components industries in our two electorates. We had the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean), as the shadow minister, talk to them. One of the things that came out was the relief that they saw now that there had been a decision made in respect of the automotive industries. There was relief that they were able to now sit down and plan for the future. The government has to take into account the psychological effect that the lack of leadership&mdash;as the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) has highlighted&mdash;has had on industry policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a need for government, and not only Minister Moore, to really look at industries. For instance, earlier in the year we had decisions made about the pharmaceutical industry, decisions that had to be put in place so that there could be a continuation and certainty in policy decisions by those in the pharmaceutical industry post the factor F scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst there has been put in place some recognition of the importance the pharmaceutical industry has to Australia and there are to be forms of assistance, what this government has lost the plot on is matching industry policy against the effect that the pharmaceutical benefits scheme has on pharmaceutical companies within Australia. At the same time, successive governments, not only the Labor government before this one but the coalition governments before that, put the lid on the price of pharmaceuticals to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. This, of course, has had an effect on the pharmaceutical industry. That has been acknowledged by all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was the reason why the elements of the factor F were put in place, so that we could achieve two aims. They were to manage the level of expenditure under the PBS, but also keep a domestic pharmaceutical industry that could be then used for exports. We have had great success in that. That is always what in those dual senses we have to achieve with our policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson) has gone to the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Finding a balance</EMPHASIS>. The discussion of this is of crucial importance to the small business sector which is such a large employer within Australia. At the end of the day what we need to see in industry policy is the emphasis on the employment outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The emphasis on the employment outcomes is our ability to manufacture here in Australia and to open up export markets so that we can ensure sustainable jobs, especially in the manufacturing industry. If this government is to achieve its aim to have 200,000 new jobs in the manufacturing industry by the year 2000, it has to keep that in mind. It has to protect manufacturing industry's ability to be able to make decisions that will ensure that we continue to achieve export markets. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the members for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), Wide Bay (Mr Truss), Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson) and Scullin (Mr Jenkins) for their contributions. The matters raised by the member for Charlton on behalf of his electorate have been well canvassed in the main chamber in recent weeks and will again, no doubt, be raised many times over. In the same vein, the  matters surrounding industry policy raised by the member for Scullin also has had much airing in the main chamber. Again, it will be an ongoing debate between the government and opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5512">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To set the record right for the member for Charlton, he did quote the Minister for Industry, Science, and Tourism (Mr Moore) as having said, `It was a good day for BHP shares when BHP decided to end steel making at Newcastle.' I have never seen that reported, and I would be more than confident, if not certain, in repudiating it on behalf of the minister. Such a callous disregard for the sensitivities of those directly and indirectly affected by the decision to end steel making in Newcastle is not part of his make&hyphen;up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing the member for Charlton mentioned was the recent rally held in Newcastle at which the government was represented by the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles). May I take the liberty of reminding the member for Charlton of the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism's visit to Newcastle on 19 May. Much of the discussion at that meeting focused on how the federal government's $10 million commitment could be used to create long&hyphen;term employment opportunities in the Hunter region. In the same vein, on 29 May the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) met with a delegation of steel workers here at Parliament House, and he expects to be visiting Newcastle soon after his return from overseas, presumably during July.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Turning now to the very interesting and important matter raised by the member for Wide Bay: it is not an unfamiliar issue with me given that he has made strong representations on behalf of Narayen Research Station for a long while now, and in that he is joined by the member for Hinkler (Mr Neville).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was very fair of the member for Wide Bay to mention the changing nature of research, to the point now where there is a question mark by the beef industry itself whether or not it wants to continue&mdash;and especially to the same financial tune&mdash;the research conducted at Narayen that previously went on. After all, if industry withdraws its funding, we do have a serious problem at CSIRO in how to make up the shortfall.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very interested in some of the alternatives canvassed by the member for Wide Bay. He suggested that the staff are disappointed that some of their innovative proposals for alternative research in different areas has not been taken seriously enough. I certainly undertake for the member for Wide Bay to pursue that with the senior management of CSIRO. We do naturally want to draw on the experience and ideas of the people at Narayen, like any other workplace, for solutions to problems such as this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He also put forward the possibility of tying in with the dynamic citrus growing region that Narayen is situated within. He also mentioned viticulture and horticulture. They are alternatives which I will direct CSIRO to pursue, if it is not already.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I do hasten to assure the member for Wide Bay that my earlier commitment to him and to the member for Hinkler will be honoured&mdash;which is that there will be no precipitous evacuation of Narayen by CSIRO. Everything is being done in full consultation with the industry and other interested parties. It sounds&mdash;if the member for Wide Bay is to be believed entirely, and I see no reason why he should not&mdash;as if the staff may not be consulted in the same fashion that other interested parties are, and I will move to rectify that.Thank you for the invitation to visit. I expect to visit Narayen some time in the future but am unable to make a commitment at this time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Wills who is no longer with us raised the hoary old chestnut of the Franchising Code Council. May I remind the member for Wills, in his absence, that the Franchising Code Council chose to close down itself. Also, in fact, the government increased the funding available to the Franchising Code Council.</PARA>

I hope that if he did not make that response that he will deny it. I will await that denial.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The $1 billion that the value of BHP shares increased by within hours of that announcement having been made came out of the pockets, out of the food cupboards and off the dinner tables of those 2,500 to 7,000 individuals and families who will lose their jobs in Newcastle as a result of that decision. That is where that increase comes from. It is a direct transfer out of their pockets and out of their budgets straight into the pockets of those people who have shares in BHP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John Prescott earns $2.23 million every year; he is the boss of BHP. As a result of that decision, his shares went up, within hours, by $1.42 million in value. That is not bad to pick up. Ron McNeily, another top executive in BHP, as a result of that decision, within hours his share value went up by $639,000. Brian Loton did not do too well&mdash;his only went up by $146,000. Gerry Ellis's share value went up by almost three&hyphen;quarters of a million dollars within hours of the decision being made that increased the value of BHP shares by $1 billion. I repeat: the decision by BHP was that in September 1999 primary steel production in Newcastle will cease, with a direct loss of 2,500 jobs, an indirect loss of another 1,500 on&hyphen;site contract jobs, and another 3,000 to 4,000 jobs in the Newcastle area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not suggest for a moment that they made their decision for the purpose of achieving that personal windfall; I do not believe they did. But they achieved the windfall as a result of a decision that they made which was prejudicial in the extreme, not only to Newcastle but to Australian industry, to Australia's future capacity in steel making, and to its position as a major and potentially greater steel exporting nation.</PARA>

<ANSWER PAGE="5517" SPEAKER="Williams, Daryl, MP" NAMEID="7V5" ELECTORATE="Tangney" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Attorney-General; Justice" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7V5">Mr Williams</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) (a) I am committed to the Australian Legal Access Forum and the Government is currently considering proposals by the Law Council of Australia on the scope and timing of such a forum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) I asked the Australian Legal Assistance Board (ALAB) to examine legal expenses insurance schemes in Australia and overseas. In its report, ALAB recognised the significant contribution of the schemes but considered funding and support of these schemes is more appropriately left with the private sector. I am currently considering ALAB's report.</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) An Australia-wide jury education program has not yet been established.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) The National Campaign Against Violence and Crime (NCAVAC) was announced in the 1996/97 Budget 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5518"> and is being developed and implemented by the Office of Law Enforcement Coordination in my portfolio. The NCAVAC represents a strategic approach to crime prevention across Australia, and is being developed in close cooperation with the States and Territories, particularly through the Lead Ministers' National Anti-Crime Strategy Group and its supporting Officers Group. Extensive consultations have already taken place to develop a set of priorities and demonstration projects which will be implemented in partnership with the States and Territories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) After carefully considering this issue, and consulting with the Federal Court, I have decided that the establishment of a Human Rights Registry in the Federal Court, in conjunction with the use of judicial registrars, is a better option. Separate Divisions can impact adversely on management flexibility within the Court. It would also be difficult to justify the creation of a separate Division of the Court for human rights matters when there are no separate arrangements for other significant and much larger workload areas in the Court, such as trade practices and commercial work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Creation of a Human Rights Registry acknowledges the mainstream nature of human rights matters, yet enables the Court to develop user friendly procedures and separate listing arrangements to facilitate handling of human rights cases. The expected caseload means that, at this stage, registry facilities for human rights matters will be co-located with existing registry facilities. However, the Court advises that its registry staff will be receiving appropriate training to deal with human rights cases. Consultations with the Court are underway about the introduction of special procedures and registry facilities for human rights cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) (a) No funding was allocated in the 1996-97 budget for the Australian Legal Access Forum. I am still considering the views of the Law Council of Australia about the Forum proposals and will address potential funding needs when I have had the opportunity to consider these proposals further.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) No funding was allocated in the 1996-97 budget for the Australian Legal Insurance Taskforce. I am still considering the views of the Australian Legal Assistance Board about the Taskforce proposals and will address potential funding needs when I have had the opportunity to consider these proposals further.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) No funding was allocated in the 1996-97 budget to establish an Australia-wide jury education program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) The Government allocated $4.4m to the NCAVAC for 1996/97.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) No funding was allocated in the 1996-97 budget for a Human Rights Division in the Federal Court. As there will be no new Division in the Court, and due to the expected caseload, existing court registry facilities will be used for human rights matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) (a) No funding has been allocated in the 1997-98 budget for the Australian Legal Access Forum. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) No funding has been allocated in the 1997-98 budget for the Australian Legal Insurance Taskforce.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) No funding has been allocated in the 1997-98 budget for a Human Rights Division in the Federal Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) This information is available from the House of Representatives Hansards which can be examined via the Parliamentary Database Service.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) Yes. A program entitled `Window on the Law' was announced by the Government in the Law and Justice For Us All policy statement issued prior to the March 1996 election. The objectives of the program are as set out in the question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of steps have been taken to implement these objectives. First, all Commonwealth legislation has been consolidated in electronic form. Second, that material (together with other Commonwealth caselaw and State and Territory legislation and caselaw from the Attorney-General's Department's SCALEplus system) has been made available free to air for all Australian schools, libraries and legal centres and the general public from an internet service operated by the Australian Government Publishing Service (AGPS). SCALEplus has been available from 1 January 1997 and statistics of use are showing wide acceptance with, typically, more than 4,000 daily `hits' being recorded on this site. The formal launch of `Window on the Law' is to be held in the near future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">`Window on the Law' will be an internet-based, free to air service which will provide Australians, schools, libraries and any organisations with internet access to: an overview of the legal system in Australia; and a gateway to SCALEplus, with access to Commonwealth legislation and other legal data. </PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) `Window on the Law' objectives are being achieved through a reprioritisation of recurrent funds within my Department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) This information is available from the House of Representatives Hansards which can be examined via the Parliamentary Database Service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(8) On 9 July 1996, the Government announced that it would legislate to prohibit the export of all refused classification materials, including child pornography, to ensure that export regulations are consistent with import regulations. The announcement followed the Government's pre-election commitment to legislate to prohibit the export of child pornography.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regulation 4A of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations prohibits the importation of a category of publications and other goods which is defined to include 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5519"> child pornography. This regulation is administered by the Attorney-General.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister Responsible for Customs, the Hon Geoff Prosser MP, is responsible for those provisions of the Customs Act which deal with prohibited exports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In consultation with the Attorney-General, the Minister Responsible for Customs is seeking amendment of the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations to make those regulations mirror regulation 4A of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Customs Service, in consultation with the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department, has issued drafting instructions to the Office of Legislative Drafting within that Department in order to implement the necessary legislative changes. The draft regulations are at an advanced stage and are currently being settled by the relevant agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(9) The Government has commenced the statute stocktake. As stated in More Time for Business, the Government's response to the Small Business Deregulation Task Force, I have written to Ministers requesting that Departments advise the Office of Parliamentary Counsel of redundant Acts for repeal, and that Ministers set priorities for repair of existing legislation. These measures complement the Commonwealth's Legislation Review Schedule, the review of legislation costly to business or restricting competition, announced by the Treasurer on 28 June 1996.</PARA>
<PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(10) The Government is awaiting the findings of research being conducted by Professor John Braithwaite at the ANU into the ACT Reintegrative Shaming Experiment (RISE project) being conducted in association with the Australian Federal Police. In addition, the Australasian Police Ministers' Council has been reviewing the range of such programs operating in different jurisdictions.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government believes that implementing tendering for the AMEP will deliver a better service to clients, including better access and improved learning outcomes, for example through greater flexibility of learning arrangements, client choice of provider and partnerships between service providers and community agencies. While ensuring best value for money is an important consideration in tendering the Program, the primary objective in subjecting the market to competition is to achieve improvements to program delivery for clients.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Benchmarks are being developed by the National Centre for English Teaching and Research (NCELTR) at Macquarie University which will allow comparison of outcomes across all AMEP service providers nationally. The benchmarks provide predictions of AMEP clients' likely learning achievement against the number of hours they spend in the AMEP, taking account of factors such as the client's literacy in own language, use of roman or non-roman script and age. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5543"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Tenderers for AMEP services are required to adopt measures to increase AMEP reach, that is the percentage of eligible clients who access the service. It is expected that this requirement, with the additional flexibility made possible through tendering, will lead to more clients taking up their AMEP entitlement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) In 1992 I commented on the comparative costs of English language programs delivered by the (then) Departments of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and Employment, Education and Training. Such comparisons have little application today as the English as a Second Language industry has changed significantly, including through the development of new high quality public and private sector providers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) Currently the AMEP is delivered by a range of agencies: Adult Migrant English Service (AMES) and University of NSW in NSW, AMES, Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) and Northern Metropolitan Institute of TAFE (NMIT) in Victoria, AMES in South Australia and Tasmania, TAFE in Queensland and WA, Northern Territory University in the Northern Territory and </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Canberra Institute of Technology in the ACT. My Department has put into place strategies including community consultations to ensure that ethnic community groups and migrants are aware of the additional choices which tendering is expected to offer AMEP clients. Further information will be provided to the community when decisions are made on service providers following completion of the tender processes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) Migrants in the skilled categories who do not have functional English are required to pay a charge before visa issue. Preferential Family and Refugee/Humanitarian entrants are exempt from the charge. The tendering process will not lead to changes in the user pays system.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Resources and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Yes, the Australia and Japan negotiate an annual bilateral fishing agreement, which provides for fishing access by Japanese longline vessels to the Australian fishing zone, targeting mainly tuna species. However no Japanese fishing trawlers are licensed to operate in the Australian fishing zone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Government will be paid $3.4 million for a shortened five month access period in 1997, a fee which compares favourably to previous full year access fees, which the Agreement normally provides for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) This years Agreement was tabled in both houses of Parliament for the 15 day period required by the Government and was signed on 4 June 1997, with fishing commencing on that date and continuing until 31 October 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bilateral Agreement enables the operators of Japanese vessels to take tuna and associated species within the terms and conditions of access specified in an annually negotiated Agreement. The predominant species is yellowfin tuna followed by big-eye tuna and broadbill swordfish.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Southern bluefin tuna (SBT) is also caught in the waters off Tasmania and NSW. The SBT catch  by Japanese vessels in the Australian fishing zone is limited to 400 tonnes and any catch against this amount is deducted from Japan's national catch allocation granted under the Convention for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Japanese vessels have restricted access to three areas of the AFZ. On the east and west coasts of Australia, they can only operate outside 50 nautical miles (nm) and north of the latitude 34 degrees South. Adjacent to Tasmania Japanese vessels can operate outside of 17 nm. They are further excluded from areas within 17 to 50 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5545"> nautical miles of the Australian coast and other areas such as marine parks and reserves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fishing access provided by Australia returns a wide range of benefits including direct financial returns that cover management and research costs as well as providing a community return on the resources taken. Other benefits include co-operative research projects, fisheries data provisions, technology transfer opportunities for Australian fishers and a substantial in port expenditure by visiting Japanese vessels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the terms and conditions of the Bilateral Agreement, administered by the Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA), the Japanese longline fleet are required to report position, effort and catch on a daily basis, are subject to pre and post fishing inspections, and at sea inspections. At the pre fishing inspection Japanese fishing masters are thoroughly briefed on the conditions on their licence and the codes of conduct in place under the Bilateral Agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">An on-board observer program covers between 10 and 30% of all fishing trips by Japanese vessels, dependent on the fishing region. This assists in the verification of figures provided by the Japanese and also enables AFMA to gain information to continuously improve the bilateral management arrangements.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The annual agreement has been the subject of an inquiry by the Joint House Standing Committee on Treaties, which recognised the overall benefits of the agreement. The Governments response to the inquiry's report is being finalised now and generally accepts the recommendations of the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Australia's current policy regarding foreign fishing is linked to its international rights and obligations under the United Nations Law of the Sea Convention (the Convention) and the need to ensure responsible conservation and management of fish stocks in the Australian fishing zone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the Convention Australia will consider applications for foreign fishing vessel access to fisheries stocks which are not fully utilised. Where foreign fishing operations are permitted the main objective is to maximise genuine, tangible and assessable benefits to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Preference is always given to fishing operations which are owned and conducted by Australians and which use Australian vessels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Foreign fishing access to the Australian fishing zone is strictly regulated and limited currently to the Japanese activity referred to in this answer, as well as limited access to United States purse seine fishing vessels licensed under the Forum Fisheries Agency Multilateral Treaty on Fisheries, some limited joint venture arrangements and some small scale artisanal fishing activity by traditional fishers in the zone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia is a party to the Multilateral Treaty on Fisheries, which is a treaty on fisheries access between the Governments of certain Pacific Island States and the Government of the United States of America. The Treaty only provides access to a limited area in the north east of the Coral Sea and United States vessels have yet to fish in our fishing zone under the Treaty.
