<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The purpose of this bill and the Ballast Water Research and Development Funding Levy Collection Bill 1997 is to enable a research and development levy to be collected from certain ships arriving in Australian ports. The Ballast Water Research and Development Funding Levy Bill 1997 will introduce a levy on certain ships to provide funding for the strategic ballast water research and development program. This is to fund research and development aimed at minimising the risk, and in the longer term possible prevention, of the introduction of unwanted marine pests and disease pathogens transported in ballast water and on ships' hulls.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Ballast Water Research and Development Funding Levy Collection Bill 1997 will provide the framework for collection of the levy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the last 10 years Australia has led the world in developing ballast water management strategies aimed at minimising the risk to Australia's marine environment, our fisheries and aquaculture industries, and on human health, posed by unmanaged ballast water discharge in Australian waters. In 1990, Australia was the first country in the world to introduce national voluntary controls to apply to the discharge of shipping ballast water and sediment from overseas vessels entering 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australian territory. This initiative was subsequently adopted by the International Maritime Organisation when, in 1991, it incorporated the principles of the Australian arrangements for international application.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia has also been at the forefront of the development within the International Maritime Organisation of a new annex to the Marpol convention&mdash;the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships&mdash;specifically for ballast water. It is hoped this annex will be internationally agreed by the end of this decade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia as an island nation and a major exporter of minerals and agricultural products is heavily dependent on shipping. Some 98 per cent of all cargo moved into and out of Australia is by ships. As such, we are also a major importer of ballast water from other countries. Each year, approximately 120 million tonnes of ballast water is discharged from over 6,000 vessels arriving at Australia's 40 ports. While ballast water has been used by shipping for around 100 years, it is only recently that the extent of the problem has become known. As shipping traffic increases, as ships become faster, and as many of the ports with which Australia trades become more polluted, then the threat to Australian waterways has increased enormously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has already been established that at least 15 unwanted aquatic species and organisms, including fish, molluscs, worms and a toxic algae, have been transferred to Australia and established here. The most likely source of transfer is ballast water. A number of these species and organisms have the potential to cause serious diseases which are harmful to humans, animals, plants and seafood production and the marine environment. These unwanted marine pests and disease pathogens are carried in ballast water and can establish in our harbours and waterways after the ballast water is discharged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ballast water management is recognised internationally as an important global issue, and Australian scientists were among the first to recognise the risks posed by ballast water. It is for these reasons that, in 1995, Australia developed its ballast water management 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8274"> strategy. The strategic ballast water research and development program, which is a key component of the strategy, was subsequently developed by the Australian Ballast Water Management Advisory Council.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The recent review of Australia's quarantine arrangements by Professor Malcolm Nairne recognised that this was not only an important issue but one that is an international issue of environmental and quarantine concern. He recommended that Australia maintain an international leadership role in relation to ballast water management. The government fully agrees with this recommendation, and through the coasts and clean seas initiative recently announced by the Prime Minister, has demonstrated its commitment by allocating $1 million for the strategic ballast water research program for 1997&hyphen;98.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In so far as ballast water is concerned, the coast and clean seas initiative also provides for: the reduction, management and local eradication of introduced marine pests; a rapid response capability to manage and eradicate marine pest outbreaks before they become established in new locations; and the implementation of management arrangements and guidelines to prevent the spread of pests transferred by coastal shipping.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While a modest research and development program has been in place for some years, it has been funded largely on an ad hoc basis, primarily by the government but also with some industry assistance. In 1997&hyphen;98, as noted above, it will be almost fully funded through the coasts and clean seas initiative. Funding is required, therefore, beyond 1997&hyphen;98.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Ballast Water Management Advisory Council, which includes shipping and bulk exporting representatives, has had this matter under consideration for some time. The council supports the introduction of a levy on shipping to fund the strategic ballast water research and development program. This agreement by industry to the implementation of a levy on shipping for two years to fund the research and development of effective ballast water management is an indication of their commitment to resolving the risks posed to Australia from ships' ballast water 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and hulls. This industry is to be complimented on their cooperation and support in establishing this funding mechanism in the endeavour to develop technically and environmentally acceptable solutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Current major research projects include the development of a decision support system, an information and communications system to monitor and support decision making concerning the risk of individual vessels and required ballast management arrangements; port baseline surveys, to ascertain existing port conditions; and heat treatment of ballast water, as a possible means of killing unwanted marine pests and pathogens. Future projects will include further evaluation of techniques for the detection of cholera in ballast water, identification of high risk vessels and routes, and the implementation of protocols for ballast water sampling and testing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Collection of the levy is to commence on 1 July 1998 and will operate for a period of two years, ceasing once the agreed amount has been collected. The amount to be collected is $2 million, with a 10 per cent variation to allow for fluctuations in collection, and interest accrued on the fund account will be added to the fund. The amount of the levy is $210 for bulk carriers and $140 for all other ships, including tankers, with a length of 50 metres or longer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation has the full support of not only those directly affected by the ballast water issue, but those who will pay the levy in the shipping industry. They have not only agreed to the levy but have been a party to all aspects of the proposed administration of the levy, including the purposes to which it is to be allocated&mdash;that is, to enable the conduct of research and development aimed at minimising the risk, and in the longer term possible prevention of the introduction of unwanted marine pests and disease pathogens found in ballast water and on ships' hulls. I commend the bill to the honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">The Australian firearms buyback, which has been a central part of the implementation of the nationwide agreement on firearms regulation, comes to a close in a few days on 30 September 1997. To date, about 570,000 firearms have been surrendered in the various states and territories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The National Firearms Program Implementation Act 1996, which appropriated the funds required to reimburse the states and territories for the compensation paid for surrendered firearms, followed the letter of that nationwide agreement. It applied, however, only to those firearms which were expressly prohibited by that agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have in addition, of course, been historically prohibited weapons, including submachine guns, heavy machine&hyphen;guns and other similar weapons in the community. It was certainly the intention of the Australasian Police Ministers Council that these weapons should also be surrendered for fair and proper compensation.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To ensure that this compensation can be properly reimbursed, it is necessary to provide authority for the Attorney&hyphen;General to certify that the surrender of particular firearms or other weapons is consistent with the spirit of the national program and to allow the Attorney&hyphen;General to authorise payments for the purpose of providing compensation to firearm owners and dealers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill is of major importance in the implementation of the national firearms program. It is, therefore, extremely important that the bill be passed as quickly as possible. The national firearms program has had bipartisan support throughout, and I ask that that support continue.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking on behalf of the opposition, I would indicate that it is our intention to oppose this migration bill. From our point of view, we believe that the House of Representatives has before it today a bill which, if passed, will bring dishonour to this nation. It is a bill which undermines cherished legal principles based on the right of appeal to the courts of this nation. It is a bill which undermines the important principle of checks and balances in our society. It is a bill which will inevitably set the stage for another showdown between the government and the High Court. I know that is not an issue in the minds of some members of the government not only with respect to this bill but also with respect to legal proceedings generally in Australia at the moment. If anything, more and more there is a tendency on the other side of the House to hold the independence of our judicial system in Australia, including the High Court, in contempt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More importantly, I do not believe that the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock), in his heart of hearts, wants to go down in our legislative history as the person who pushed this most dishonourable law through this parliament. I suggest that in his heart he knows better. But neither the minister nor the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) seems to have the political muscle to convince cabinet colleagues that there is something inherently wrong in this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The principal aim, indeed the only aim, of this bill is to restrict access to both the Federal Court and the High Court. This is done by the mechanism of introducing so&hyphen;called privative clause decisions relating to visas of all classes. In effect, under this bill there will be no review of decisions of the Refugee Review Tribunal or the new Migration Review Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my view, even the very best administrative tribunals need the oversight of the courts. Tribunal members are not always lawyers&mdash;nor should administrative review tribunals be made up solely of lawyers. It reminds me of my old days in the industrial arena: we sought to go out of our way to ensure that the legalistic approach to dealing with people was 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> taken out of the conflict situation. Non&hyphen;lawyers can and do bring important and valuable insights and knowledge to the work of administrative tribunals. They tend to be better than lawyers in dealing with people and personal situations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we accept that it is not a condition of membership of a tribunal that you have legal training, let alone that you have a great legal brain, then we should not be contemplating removing the right of appeal and the right of scrutiny by the courts. Whether the tribunal decision is straightforward or complex or even whether the tribunal is good or bad, we should maintain the principle that all tribunals must be subject to the review of the courts. To my way of thinking, that is a fundamental principle. Review of legal procedures has historically been the approach of this great nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In any event, the Refugee Review Tribunal, as it is at the moment, is a case study in why a watchful court is needed to ensure they do not overstep their jurisdiction. As an example of the apparent inability of the tribunal&mdash;or at least its principal member&mdash;to understand its own legislation, I cite a recent report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper of Friday, 22 August of this year. The principal member of the Refugee Review Tribunal requested the minister to sign off on appointments of acting senior members which he did not have the jurisdiction to make. If the principal member, a so&hyphen;called expert on these issues, was not aware of the legislative limits on his power and the minister's power in this regard, it is clear that he and his tribunal need a watchful court to ensure that they do not overstep their jurisdiction. On the other hand, if the principal member knew he did not have the jurisdiction to act as he did with regard to the appointments and still made the request to you, then it is even more important and clear that he needs the oversight of a watchful court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also suggest to the House that there is a fear amongst those interested in civil liberties that the privative clauses in this bill are a trial run. I do not think the importance of that view can be underestimated by the House.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government is successful here, the worry is&mdash;and it is a widespread worry 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8277"> not just among civil libertarians but also amongst lawyers irrespective of their political persuasion&mdash;that similar provisions may be introduced in another area of administrative review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also suggest to the minister that all tribunals need courts to watch over them. For example, the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal recently purported to make a new appointment, which took to three the number of community representatives. Unfortunately, the legislation only allows for two such members. Again, this is an example of a tribunal head who does not understand the limits of his power as set out in his legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister is basing the need to remove the right to appeal to the Federal Court on a perception that all those who are unsuccessful at the tribunal stage are in some sense rorting the system.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard a lot about rorting the system in recent days, be it waterside workers or, perhaps a bit closer to home, ministers of the Crown. It is about time we came clean on some of these issues. The intent of the legislation, in the minister's mind, is that by these changes we would not be allowing such people to keep rorting the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister knows that this is simply not the case for asylum seekers. An applicant can be unsuccessful because the tribunal does not correctly apply the relevant law. The law to be applied to refugee matters can be very complex and requires an understanding of international conventions and Australia's obligations under those conventions, as well as of Australian law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will refer to one appeal, the Yesus case of 1996. The judge, Justice Madgwick, said that this particular applicant faced the possibility of being arrested and detained for some significant period of time should he return to Ethiopia. The judge ruled that this amounted to persecution. Therefore, the tribunal member had misapplied the basic test for deciding whether a person was a refugee or not. It is the minister's intention that, under the new privative clauses, this could not have been looked at by any court.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this bill becomes law, there is a real possibility that Mr Yesus would have been deported and possibly `disappeared' on his return to his home country. I do not think that is an issue that should be dismissed lightly. This would clearly be a breach of our obligations under the refugees convention and a blot on Australia's claim to be a humanitarian nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think the minister, in his heart of hearts, wants to be associated with such an approach to the handling of these sensitive and important issues. These issues not only are important domestically; they go to international standing. As the minister and I know, Australia has had good standing internationally&mdash;irrespective of who has been in government&mdash;for many years with respect to these issues. My only concern now is that others in the cabinet have other views on these matters. The truth of the matter is that the minister may have been rolled with respect to what he regards as fair play on these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The intended end result of the privative clauses will be that only in very exceptional circumstances will a tribunal decision be reviewed. Unfortunately, those very exceptional circumstances will not be related to the seriousness of the possible error as regards the applicant for asylum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there is a major flaw in a Refugee Review Tribunal decision, such as a misunderstanding of persecution as in the case I have cited, that would not be reviewable. But, under the examples given by the minister in his second reading speech, a decision could be challenged, even on a minor technicality, if it is found that the person making the decision had not been validly appointed&mdash;for example, if the principal member of the Refugee Review Tribunal had not validly appointed the senior members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand the minister's frustration about the number of asylum seeker applications. It is understood on both sides of the House. However, on this issue it may be useful if the minister asked his department to check, and I would hope he would report to the parliament whether it is not the case that from the same countries where his government has now relaxed visa requirements we have now seen 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8278"> the greatest increase in onshore refugee applicants in the last 12 months. Minister, if your government had a well run visa system it would screen out some of the shonky applicants well before they arrived in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his argument for these privative clauses, the minister has relied on the fact that a substantial minority of applicants withdraw their applications to the court prior to the hearing. Without more information this parliament cannot say this is real evidence that these people were not genuine applicants. Minister, some of these people may have withdrawn because they could not afford to continue the action. There could also be other legitimate reasons that applicants have chosen to withdraw.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the opposition finds distasteful is that the government's aim in the privative clause is to exclude almost entirely the High Court as well. However, the coalition will probably fail in this objective. The jurisdiction of the High Court cannot be totally excluded and, to a large degree, how much it can be excluded will depend on the High Court itself. As the minister would know, the courts have viewed privative or ouster clauses with distaste, fearing that the right of the judiciary to insist that legislation is correctly interpreted and validly applied will disappear if they, the courts, are not vigilant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Privative clauses of the type in this bill will invariably lead to complex and expensive cases to interpret what exactly is included in the restrictions. The minister knows this because he made reference to it in his second reading speech. The minister should desist from the attempt to oust the jurisdiction of the High Court and avoid the very real risk that applicants who truly fear persecution would be denied a chance to put their case to the courts. If this bill is enacted lawyers will have a field day before the High Court. They will argue that privative clauses may, for example, take away the court's constitutional powers, provide the tribunals with broader powers than they legitimately should have, breach our international obligations and, finally, breach natural justice.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us go through some of the basics of each of these legal arguments. Firstly, let us go to the question of the court's constitutional powers being taken away. The High Court could read the privative clauses in the bill in the literal meaning of the words. For example, section 474(1)(c) states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A privative clause decision is not subject to prohibition, mandamus, injunction, declaration or certiorari in any court on any account.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The courts could say that such a paragraph is a direct attempt to take away powers given the High Court by the constitution, which states at section 75 that the High Court has original jurisdiction in all matters in which a writ of mandamus or prohibition is sought against an officer of the Commonwealth. There are several High Court decisions which have interpreted these clauses in this way and have therefore said that they were invalid or had only limited operation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly I go to the issue of providing tribunals with broader powers than they legitimately should have. The privative clause can be read as giving the tribunals broader powers than they would otherwise have rather than as a direct attack on the jurisdiction and powers of the court. The minister, in his second reading speech, indicated that in his view the success of this bill depends on the High Court taking this second view, the so&hyphen;called Hickman view of the privative clause. However, even the Hickman principle of expanding the jurisdiction of the previous decision maker will not necessarily lead to a valid decision, even when there is no constitutional invalidity. Justice Brennan, as he was then, indicated this in the Richard Walter case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there is an inconsistency between the privative clauses and those parts of the legislation which limit the power of the decision maker, the provisions must be read together in an attempt to give effect to each. Perhaps more importantly, in the Richard Walter case, Justice Brennan indicated that the privative clause was valid in part because the taxpayer had a right to challenge the assessment in a judicial as well as an administrative tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly I go to the question of the potential breach of international obligations. I would 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8279"> draw the minister's and the House's attention to another principle of statutory interpretation, which is that the courts should favour that interpretation of Australia's law which accords with Australia's obligation under a treaty or convention to which Australia is a party. A privative clause in its present form may be read down by the High Court in conformity with the Hickman principles and others so as to not place Australia in breach of its international obligations. The minister appears to contemplate that Australia may be in breach of its international obligations and that he may be asking the High Court to accept and condone this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fourthly I go to the issue of breach of natural justice. From the statements of High Court judges Deane, Gaudron, McHugh and Dawson in the 1991 O'Toole case on privative clauses it is not at all certain that the High Court would accept them because they condone a breach of natural justice. Recently your colleague Senator Vanstone, the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, who is one of the real stars of the coalition government&mdash;I wonder if she gets the same going over in the coalition caucus that the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) received yesterday&mdash;acting in your position it seemed got herself into some legal hot water with the High Court on this very issue, with a breach of natural justice involving American radical Mr Ervin. When this issue came before the Chief Justice of the High Court, Justice Brennan, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a matter of the gravest constitutional importance to think that the proposition would be advanced on behalf of the minister that this court does not have the jurisdiction to control unlawful acts committed by the minister.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I suggest on the basis of these comments it is not at all certain that these privative clauses would be accepted by the High Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, I go back to where I started. The opposition has not lightly considered our position today. We understand some of the concerns with respect to the issue of refugees, but for us this is an issue of principle and one on which we will not take a backward step. I question whether the objective of stopping a cherished legal principle, the right of appeal to a court of this nation, is an honourable 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> decision. I question whether the objective of allowing tribunals to act in breach of the requirements of natural justice is an honourable decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, the opposition will not agree to this bill as it stands. We will oppose it; we will not seek to amend it. I also suggest that the government is heading for another expensive brawl with the High Court. That is for the government to decide. If that is where we end up then we will not be making any progress with respect to the handling of these difficult issues.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to speak on the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1997, I must say I am very pleased but disappointed&mdash;mixed emotions, you might say&mdash;at the closing comments by the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson), who said that the opposition will be opposing this legislation. It really does draw yet another line in the sand on where the Labor Party stands, with their failed legislation. They are not willing to own up to and admit mistakes, which we all make, and move forward with the process; they want to remain in a system which has proven to be against the best interests of Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just want to make it very clear why this amendment bill has in fact been moved forward. It really stems from a commitment by the government before the last election to address what is seen by the overwhelming number of Australians as an appalling situation, where people either illegally arrived or illegally remaining in Australia are able to prolong for inordinate periods of time their stay in this country, tying up enormous amounts of resources for no real outcome. This is simply because the system which we currently have has failed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you really want a stark situation to be outlined, I have been informed that there is one gentleman who arrived in Australia in 1986 on a one&hyphen;month visa who is still here today and who has been abusing the process, the courts and the associated situations which are available to him under the current legislation to ensure that he can remain in Australia illegally. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8280">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure that all members' offices would be aware that we have numerous cases of people wishing to migrate to this country who genuinely have a reason to do so and want to use the correct process, and they are frustrated because Australia has a very small migration program at this stage in our history. They get extremely frustrated when they see people abusing the system&mdash;a system set up by the previous government which it will not admit the failings of. This ensures that these people are using resources which could be better used throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at some statistics. In 1994&hyphen;95, there were 398 cases in the courts; in 1995&hyphen;96, there were 630; and in 1996&hyphen;97&mdash;remembering it is under the previous government's legislation&mdash;it is over 640. In 1995&hyphen;96, approximately 65 per cent of the Federal Court's entire administrative case load was on migration matters. The 1995&hyphen;96 budget shows that litigation cost taxpayers $7.4 million; and that does not include the cost of legal aid or running the courts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently there are 590 active cases before the courts, and from experience about 40 per cent of those will actually withdraw, so they really do not have a case. In 90 per cent of the remaining 60 per cent of cases the government will be successful in fighting their applications. That means that out of 590 cases we will end up with some 23 successful applicants, at an enormous cost in time, money and resources to the Australian taxpayer. From 1993&hyphen;94 to 1995&hyphen;96 the average number of days from the date of application for judicial review to the handing down of a decision trebled, for Refugee Review Tribunal decisions, from 107 days to 354 days. The Immigration Review Tribunal decisions doubled from 259 to 488.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of these are very good reasons why this legislation must be amended to make way for legislation which will meet the needs of Australians. The estimated cost of keeping a person at an immigration detention facility in 1996&hyphen;97 is $137 a day. As at June 1997, there were 643 in detention facilities, with the total detainee days being 84,741, at an estimated cost to you, the Australian taxpayer, of $10 million. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why we should only allow people who have come to this country in many cases illegally or have overstayed their visas to have access to the courts in extraordinary cases.</PARA>

When a refugee comes to Australia, I believe that their case should be handled fairly and quickly, and there really should be an emphasis on the speed. We do not want to see people tying up resources, whether it be in detention centres or whether it be in the courts. What good does it do them? They are not getting on with their lives. It is no good for them and it is no good for the rest of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This came to a head last year when it was revealed that boat people who had been detained for some 700 days were in fact granted Australian taxpayers' money for having been detained here in excess of the allowable time. I quote from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> of 5 November 1996. I am sure most of the people in the gallery will recall this. It read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 56 asylum seekers were held in Immigration Department detention centres for 700 days, after being found on the Mitchell Plateau in January 1992. Earlier this year the Federal Court ruled that under Australian law they could not be held for more than 273 days. Thirty&hyphen;eight of the group then sued the Government.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think that is the thing that most Australians find disturbing and appalling, that they come to Australia illegally and then they sue us. I just could not see that happening overseas, but under the law that still stands to this day they could do that.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Allegedly, they were deprived of their liberty and suffered mental and bodily pain and anguish. They settled for an undisclosed amount.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is proof positive that it is essential we address this situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To put this into context, once again drawing a line in the sand between the current legislation&mdash;which is supported by the member for Batman and his colleagues&mdash;and that of the response by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) in this amendment bill, the analogy I would like to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8281"> draw is that of industrial relations and the unfair dismissal laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been an enormous amount written and spoken about unfair dismissal laws. Under the old law, if someone was found thieving from their employer, in some cases they would go before the court&mdash;which is what it was: a legal court&mdash;and it would be found that the employer did not cross every t and dot every i. He was morally correct and correct in every form other than the fact that he had missed some small administrative detail. As a result of missing some small administrative detail, in some cases employers were forced to reinstate employees or pay them some form of compensation! Could anything be more hypocritical than that: saying that that system&mdash;where someone steals from you and then you have to pay them for the privilege&mdash;is good?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That situation is very similar to this one, in that a person whose case, on whatever basis&mdash;overstaying a visa or not being of refugee status&mdash;has been found to be failing, has been able, through a court of appeal, to find that there has been some administrative glitch. There was nothing fundamentally wrong with the decision, but not every t had been crossed and every i dotted. As a result of that, we find Australians having to put up with detention costs, court costs and a sense of frustration that the Australian concept of a fair go is not being attained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those members opposite, I want to make it very clear that I am not one of the people who believe that you put a shell under the waterline or turn the boats around when people try to land in Australia. As I have stated in many public meetings in my electorate&mdash;where those views are held by some&mdash;these people should be allowed to land and to prove their case in a short period of time. When you look at some of the events in our region of late&mdash;where leadership challenges have caused people great consternation and perhaps lives have been put at risk&mdash;I would hate to think that we, as a compassionate nation, would turn those people away and send them back to either death or detention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time, the figures prove quite conclusively that those people are a very 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> small minority. I do not have the exact figures, but everyone will recall the crew of approximately 160 `designer boat people'&mdash;as I think they were called&mdash;who arrived only a few months ago in a steel hulled boat. Under the previous law, you could have expected nearly 160 of those people still to be here today. The minister may correct me, but I believe there are only four of them remaining in Australia today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not widely reported in the press. It means that 156 had no legal right, no humanitarian right and no right as refugees&mdash;no refugee status&mdash;to be in this country, and they quite rightly were returned whence they came. The other four are still being investigated to see whether or not they can justify being here.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The  Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4)  honours the government's pre&hyphen;election policy commitment, restricting access to judicial review in all but exceptional circumstances. That is where the opposition wants to draw a line with us. They are saying,`Give everybody access to the courts. Let them stay here for years.' I remind you, in 1986 a man arrived on a one&hyphen;month visa and he is still here today. He is allowed to work. No doubt he has been accessing our social security 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8282"> system and our health system&mdash;and he is only one of many examples. And the ALP wonder why the Australian public has had a gutful! You really must be embarrassed by the fact that these people are being succoured by you when they have no right to be in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us draw a clear distinction between those who have a real reason to be in Australia&mdash;those people who really are fearful of persecution in the countries they have come from&mdash;and those who have no real reason to be here. Let us ensure that we deal with them in a speedy manner, so that those who have a reason to be here can be integrated into Australia fully and not feel as though they are some add&hyphen;on to our communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The originally scheduled Migration Legislation Amendment (No. 4) Bill dealt with the amalgamation of the initial departmental review of non&hyphen;humanitarian visa decisions with the next stage of the review process for such decisions, reviewed by the Immigration Review Tribunal. This part of the bill was deemed by the Labor Party to be non&hyphen;controversial. However, the Migration Legislation Amendment (No. 5) Bill inserts a privative clause which will have the effect of narrowing the possibility of judicial review by the Federal and High Courts. It will permit administrative decisions to be considered valid, subject to procedural defect and legal irregularity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the whole point. Anybody who applies through the system will still be accepted into Australia if it is found that they have a genuine case. But we will not allow this never ending process of litigation and appeals, this use and abuse of the process by people seeking to overstay in Australia. That costs Australian taxpayers substantial sums of money and ties up valuable court time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that this bill responds to the needs and the concerns of the wider community of Australia. If those views are not accepted by those opposite in the Labor Party, then I suggest that they go back and listen to the people. It could be the first time they have done that in a long time.</PARA>

This very issue that we are talking about was one of the subjects of an inquiry by the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations in August 1992, of which I was the chairman and the minister was the deputy chairman.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that we have had problems, as the member for Longman (Mr Brough) talked about, in drawing the line on how we deal with refugee applicants in the most fair way. This is not a simple question. There are things that can be put in place to deal with the issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that 1992 report, the committee put down a number of bipartisan recommendations to deal with some of the key issues, which were 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8283"> later adopted by the Labor government&mdash;for example, the question of the speedy processing of refugee applications to ensure that, when people arrive on our shores as boat people or in aeroplanes and seek asylum, they are speedily dealt with. That was a problem which had to be dealt with by bringing in new regulations, and they were supported by the then Labor government and by the then opposition. So we had a bipartisan approach to dealing with this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has happened? The minister claims that there are too many cases of refugee applicants going to the courts on matters which should not go to the courts. He says that he wants the process further speeded up to the point where people will not be able to appeal to the courts. But there is a need to balance the question of speeding up the processing of these applications with the question of justice for applicants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also a constitutional issue concerning the separation of powers&mdash;the issue of what the parliament is responsible for and what the High Court is responsible for. These issues have been trampled on in this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In dealing with the question of needing to have a more speedy processing of applications, the minister put into place the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4), which was approved by this parliament.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am being interjected on by `billable hours', the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson), who recited a speech very well that I would imagine was written for him by some of the migration lawyers who make an absolute feast out of the complexity and the options for review and appeal. He well&hyphen;deservedly describes that as pro bono work on behalf of those migration lawyers, although some might argue that it was an investment in their future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point we are here to discuss today is the fact that there are people seeking to delay and to abuse some of the review processes that are available to legitimate people with a grievance in this country in order to stay here longer than their visas entitle them to or to bypass our migration program entirely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are hundreds of thousands of people around the world wishing to migrate to this country. We have a system in place&mdash;albeit, one that is being hampered by those opposite in the Labor Party&mdash;to process applications for migration to this country, which has legitimate terms and conditions under which migration will be supported and those applications approved, as well as a very important program in the refugee area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This country has opened its heart each year to thousands of people from war&hyphen;torn sections of the world, who are being legitimately persecuted and have the view that they can no longer stay in their home country, to provide a refuge for them in this country. The last thing most average Australians want is to see that generosity abused.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you have people applying for refugee status in this country or seeking to stay in this country because of very genuine reasons and fear of persecution if they return to their own country, we should be very careful in how we handle the generosity that the nation has provided to the rest of the world. One way to undermine the support for that generosity is to perpetuate a system that allows people to rort those provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If people apply to be a refugee and if they seek to extend the appeal options that are available to them purely to stay in this country against the provisions of our migration program&mdash;not having proven their eligibility 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to be here or on the grounds that they are claiming or, more particularly, having queue jumped in front of those people who have done the right thing in working with this nation and its migration policies and in respecting the generosity and the heartfelt goodwill that Australians have towards genuine refugees&mdash;they deserve to be treated in a way that recognises that abuse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition went to the election with a policy in which it made very clear its intention to limit judicial review to migration decisions in all but exceptional circumstances. This commitment was based on the fact that, despite there being extensive merit review rights in the current system through independent tribunals, many people were seeking to extend their right to stay here by abusing further review options that were available to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You could listen to the member for Calwell or even `billable hours', the member for Batman, and think that they have no form on this matter. In the evidence provided to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee it was quite clearly put that the  Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 5)  is a continuation of a process to limit judicial review that was commenced under the Labor Party&mdash;under the former government.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1K6">Mr BILLSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. My friend and colleague the member for Kooyong, who is highly respected in the migrant community, has quite rightly pointed out that the Labor Party wants the community to just forget about its form on these issues and to forget about the fact that in 1986 there was already a start to these sorts of changes. Those most recent changes were in 1994 when then Minister Bolkus recognised that there was a problem with the review processes through the courts and that that was being abused and was clogging up the system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former government decided to expand and extend the merits review process&mdash;not dissimilar from the government's strategy&mdash;and reduce access to the courts on grounds of natural justice. So you could not apply to the courts because you felt natural justice had been denied to you in your application. But 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8288"> you do not hear about that. The Labor Party would have you all believe that they did not do that. They would have you all believe that they have not gone down this path that the government is seeking to pursue in this case, but they have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason why we are here discussing this bill today is that the Labor Party was spectacularly unsuccessful. The number of people applying to the courts to have migration decisions reviewed has gone up. So despite the Labor government introducing a measure to limit access to the courts in processing reviews of migration decisions, what has happened? The applications have gone up. We are hearing this righteous indignation from the other side&mdash;in some cases script pro bono by migration lawyers, I suspect&mdash;telling us that this is the most outrageous thing and the greatest threat that this community has faced for a long time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the Labor Party is going on about is utter nonsense, and it would do well to take heed from what the coalition did in opposition. It supported these changes and said, `If they don't work, we'll be back. If they are unsuccessful in achieving their objectives, the coalition will revisit this matter,' and the coalition has. The coalition has gone further to strengthen the merits review process. The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) has even strengthened the personnel who are available to conduct those merits review processes.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is just grotesque. The closer parallel you would draw is the similarities between the member for Calwell and the member for Oxley. The drivel that the member for Calwell has just gone on with has all the hallmarks of what the member for Oxley goes on about&mdash;appealing to the crowd, trying to be sensational, being a little economical with the truth and facts at times and playing to a constituency. Those characteristics are commonly shared between the member for Oxley and the member for Calwell. The member for Calwell and the member for 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Oxley would do well to familiarise themselves with the facts of this matter and try to get a little bit in tune with what the broader Australian community is saying.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As my colleague the member for Bowman (Mrs West) mentioned earlier, people are appalled by the fact that someone who applies for a one&hyphen;month visitors visa in 1986 is still here a decade later because of the way you can manipulate the review process and do legal gymnastics to hang around more than a decade after the visa expired.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the refugee area you have people applying for refugee status who have been able to find the money to travel to this country, have applied successfully for a visitors visa or something like that, have left at a time of their choosing and chose the destination themselves, have been able to organise their affairs back in their home country to come here, have been able to communicate with people back in their country of origin and have had the time to brief, liaise and fund immigration lawyers to put together a refugee case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Contrast those people with the people who are in war&hyphen;torn parts of this world where, because of their appearance, their religion and their beliefs, they are killed. They are not able to have the basic human rights of safety, shelter and comfort. That is the contest that is on here. The Australian community has opened its heart to thousands of refugees each year, recognising that this is a refuge for people&mdash;a place where they can live out their lives free of that sort of persecution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have those opposite arguing that we should be making those places available for the people that can afford to spend $600,000 to $700,000 in some cases backing up their refugee claim. That is just breathtaking. It leads you to ask: what are the Labor Party trying to do? Who are they trying to please? Are they trying to please the Australian community? No, because they are out of touch there. They do not understand the concern that surrounds this abuse of the migration program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are not trying to please the Australian people. Have they tried to help legitimate migrants who go through the due processes of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8289"> this country, who apply in accordance with the migration program and who, in some cases, queue up for days at our posts overseas to put their case forward and be tested against the provisions of the migration program? No, they do not want to help those people either. Do they want to help the people who come from war&hyphen;torn parts of the world where ethnic cleansing and those sorts of things mean that basic living is not doable in those countries, the people who apply for refugee status and out of the goodness of our hearts in this country we support a lot of those people to start a new life here? No.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does that leave us with? That leaves us with the people who come to this country and then try to manipulate the system to stay here, many of whom use finances that would represent almost a year's budget for some of the governments of countries where genuine refugees come from to try to stay here and rort the system. The Labor Party is trying to help those people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Are they trying to help the migration lawyers whose billable hours go through the roof because of the legal and process gymnastics you can engage in to stay here, notwithstanding the fact that you have had a genuine review of the merits of your claim? These are the sorts of questions I encourage everybody to think about&mdash;those in the gallery, those listening and those on both sides of the House. Who is the Labor Party trying to please here?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had `billable hours Ferguson', the member for Batman, talking about his understanding of what was a legally robust proposal and suggesting that this was somehow vulnerable, that the continuation of a program, a strategy, that was commenced under the former Labor government is something that is so abhorrent that it could not possibly pass legal muster. Then we had the member for Calwell come in and give his account of the robustness of this measure. But what has the government done? The government has said, `Here is our policy position. It is clear that the broader community supports our view. We have gone and got the best legal advice available and we have asked the question of how we implement this measure.'</PARA>

It is amazing how vigorous and robust you can be when you feel your billable hours are under threat.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what has the government done? It has sought advice from the Attorney-General's Department. But that is not all. Eminent counsel was also consulted&mdash;David Bennett QC; Robert Ellicott QC; Tom Hughes QC; Richard Tracey QC; Mr Dennis Rose QC; and, as I mentioned, the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department. That is not bad. If you stack that up, there are eminent legal counsel with no vested interest offering advice&mdash;probably some of the same eminent legal counsel who gave the opposition whip, the member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay), advice on the bike fiasco. They have given very good advice to this government&mdash;advice that was not borne out of a motive of self&hyphen;service or out of a desire to protect an interest, self&hyphen;preservation, self&hyphen;interest. These people provided eminent advice, with no stake in it, that this was entirely doable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, the proposal before this parliament reflects that advice. Who would you go with? Would you go with `billable hours Batman'&mdash;and I congratulate you, Martin, on your capacity to read a legal brief that I am sure the migration lawyers had a hand in, and it sounded almost credible&mdash;or the member for Calwell who very scantily referred to the matter before the House, as colourful as it was, flamboyant even at times? Would you go with that advice or would you go with this non-vested interest eminent legal advice? I know what horse I would rather be on&mdash;the government's horse. This is a proposal which was referred to this eminent legal counsel, and the advice the government was provided with is what you see embraced in the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said earlier, the 1989 changes that the previous government introduced tried to provide certainty in decision making&mdash;and that is fine; this came out of the Senate inquiry into it&mdash;through codification and a strengthening of the merits review process by 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8290"> trying to reduce applications to the Federal Court. But that was spectacularly unsuccessful. But, as I said, that was in 1989.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have mentioned that, in 1984, the then minister, Senator Bolkus, went even further. To use a phrase of a colleague of the opposition from some time past, what are those opposite going on about? This is a proposition that is borne out of a strategy that they have already commenced, that is being introduced by a minister who is extraordinarily credible amongst the migration and refugee community, that is supported by government opinion, that seeks to implement strategies that the previous government embraced but have now just dropped.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is like a case file&mdash;and I can understand why the member for Batman might be handling it this way&mdash;where the billable hours concerned with that case are the only thing you focus your mind on. What those who were providing him that advice did not do was go back and look at his form. There is bucket loads of form from the Labor Party which I would have thought would have seen them support this measure.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was some suggestion by those opposite that somehow this measure would deny people access to the courts. That is not right either. The privative clause that the government is seeking to implement here is not only valid but leaves open the opportunity for judicial review to the courts. We heard before those opposite trying to mount the case that if the tribunal acted beyond its powers where would people go? They would go to the courts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The provisions that allow access to judicial review remain strong and remain responsive to the sorts of issues those opposite raised. If the decision maker was not acting in good faith we can zip off to the courts. If they did not have the authority to make the decision 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that they had made or if a member had not been properly appointed we can zip off to the courts. If they are exceeding their constitutional limits we can zip off to the courts. Those opposite were trying to have you believe that that was not the case. They are wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This provision seeks, with matters of judgment and application of the parameters applying to people's migration and refugee applications, to have an intellectual gymnastics exercise about who said what, how, and whether they were right in arriving at certain conclusions, taking into account all the matters before them. Then getting on that train&mdash;a gravy train for migration lawyers&mdash;and trying to delay the ultimate decision, is not the way to go. In some of these court cases, even if the court does find there perhaps was a microscopic breach of the black-letter law about process, the matter is sent back to the tribunal. And guess what happens? They get knocked back again. They tidy up, dotting the i's and crossing the t's, and they get knocked back again. What arrant nonsense comes from those opposite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mentioned earlier the credibility that surrounds this matter: the fact that eminent advice has been taken on board; the fact that former governments did start down this path and were spectacularly unsuccessful. The coalition government is now trying to implement measures that actually make a difference, and implement the policy commitments that the coalition took to the electorate. I would have thought those things would have been supported.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs in his second reading speech said that the government believed restricting access to judicial review was necessary. This is proposed by the privative clause I have just spoken about. What we are looking at is the merits review process, where someone can put their case before someone who is skilled in that area of law, and argue their case on its merits against the parameters that have been established for the program for refugee access. They can still do all those things. And we have actually tweaked that process up. So you can be even more confident about that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8291"> merits review process. If, as I mentioned earlier, those three aspects of the decision are unsatisfactory, there still is access to the courts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the most useful thing those opposite could do would be to reacquaint themselves with their position when in government, be a little bit honest with the Australian community, try to salvage a skerrick of credibility about their position on this particular migration issue and many others, and recognise that this nation is blessed with having one of the most decent persons Australia has produced as its minister, someone who has a long history of understanding and working with the migrant and refugee community. Those opposite could also reacquaint themselves with one thing that the vast majority of Australians hate&mdash;that is, somebody trying to rort systems while others are going through the process reasonably expecting, and receiving, a fair go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just bring you back to that contrast: do we want to support, to facilitate, people staying in this country who have bypassed the migration program, who have displaced people who have done the right thing and gone through that process&mdash;those legitimate refugees we see in sad parts of the world where they cannot live in peace because of war, because of ethnic tension, because of violence, because of religious tensions? Or do we want to leave our refugee program open and exposed to people who think they can buy their way into this country; people who, by their presence, stall their removal by arguing that they have been here for so long they should be entitled to stay? Do we want to help support the people whom those opposite, particularly the shadow minister, the member for Batman, are trying to help&mdash;those billable hours migration lawyers and those people who are seeking access to this country by displacing those who have legitimately gone through the processes that this country has set up, in compliance with all the laws under the sun? Do we want to support that, or do we want to support the bill?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would encourage everybody to support the bill. It is good law, it is safe, it is solid, and it is responsive to what the Australian com

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You sting them, and they get up and try to wriggle out of it. They try to wriggle out of it by throwing a bit of invective around, trying to move the issue off themselves. That is the truth. The people who are driving the views of this government are people who do not want migration to this country. They are people who do not want to help those who are not as well off as they are. The government's policies in a number of areas have shown that in recent times.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Dunkley says `We shouldn't let people have access to the courts.' The government have done their level best to try to cut legal aid and other mechanisms which will give people access to the courts. The minister, in his second reading speech, has said that the bill will `limit' the judicial review of decisions made under the Migration Act relating to the ability of non-citizens to enter and remain in Australia. It is part of this doublespeak we get from the government. It is part of the nice front from the minister, and part of the nasty front from the people behind them. It will not limit them; it will stop them. It will take away from the system, rather than enhance the system. The minister knows what he is doing; he is fixing up the wrong end of the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After all these things have been done, the minister says: `Shock, horror! We really ought not let these people get past the immigration department's decision makers and into the courts and let some unbiased judge make a decision. We should not do that because, my goodness, the loose cannons in the court might actually take into account the circumstances of the person. We couldn't have that, could we? We couldn't have people getting a fair go. We couldn't have some unbiased decision maker reviewing the decision of the immigration tribunals or the immigration department. We must do something to limit people's access to the courts.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, quite apart from the question of the constitutionality of what is being proposed in this legislation, there is a very important question of human justice: the right of a person, be they the highest or the lowest, to be able to seek a review of what has happened to them through the courts.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is difficult not to be a bit cynical about the government's intentions. The government is deliberately trying to take away powers from the High Court and the Federal Court. The problem that this government is having in a wide range of areas now is that they seem to be getting themselves offside with the courts. This is just one of a tranche of things we will see from the government over the next little while where the government tries to keep ordinary Australians out of the courts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The courts are looking at a number of things this government is doing and saying that they do not think that is fair; they do not think that justice is being delivered. We had the absolutely unusual spectre earlier this year of the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) attacking the courts because he did not like the decision and the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) sitting mute, and then sitting mute for longer. Finally, the Chief Justice of the High Court said last week that if the government wants judges to stay out of the political system, as they should, then someone needs to defend the judiciary, and that should be the Attorney-General.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the government goes a step further and says: `One of the things we will do in legislation such as this and in cuts to legal aid is keep people out of the courts. We will stop the courts from making adverse decisions on these ridiculous pieces of legislation we are putting forward and decisions that we are making by limiting the right of people to have access to the courts.' In doing that in the cause of making savings and rationalisation, which is what the government is doing, they are giving no thought to the overall fairness of the system. Doesn't the government appreciate or even want to consider that the careful system of checks and balances in the present system is about trying to ensure that people are not dealt harshly with by harsh governments?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen the behaviour of ministers in this House in recent times where they keep saying to the opposition: `We are not going to give you debating time, we are not going let you speak on this matter, we are not going to let you speak on that matter, because we won the election. So we should be able to do 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8293"> whatever we like to do. We are going to set new and higher standards. But we won the election and you are not going to be able to participate.' Unfortunately for the government, the courts are saying that they want to make some comments about what the government is doing, about whether legislation stands up, about whether decisions stand up. So the government adopts the same attitude there: `We will gag the parliament. We have succeeded in doing that. We will now try to gag the courts.' One of the ways they want to gag the courts is by taking away people's rights to go to a court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government says, and the opposition has said in the past, that there are people who are extremely litigious, there are lawyers who try to make a living off the backs of people who are in desperate straits. All of us as members of parliament know the letters that we get from sleazy local solicitors who cannot fix someone's problem for them and then send them off to their local member of parliament after they have mucked up the case. Every member of parliament who has an electorate with a large number of people from non-Australian backgrounds knows that. The member for Kooyong knows it. I know it. The member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) knows it. Maybe even the member for Dunkley, on the sylvan shores of the Mornington Peninsula, might come across the odd such person from time to time. Maybe he has a guilty conscience. Maybe he did not handle some of those cases rightly in the past. Maybe he is trying to protect all the dopey suburban lawyers who muck up these cases and then send them off to us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that people get charged $500 and $1,000 for a letter from some spiv solicitor that we would do for free. I make a very loud noise in my electorate&mdash;I am sure that the member for Kooyong does and I know that the member for Batman does&mdash;telling my constituents and those people who are not Australian citizens but who still live in my electorate, `Don't go to lawyers, come and see us as the first port of call; it will save you money and probably get you a better shake with the bureaucracy,' because the people who work in our offices, as well as ourselves, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> probably know far more about the immigration system than any suburban lawyer who will charge them $500 or $1,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is even being nice to suburban lawyers rather than to the people I think are the scum of the earth&mdash;the people who are a cyst on the system: the spivvy, spivvy immigration agents&mdash;because I have not found too many of them who are in any way, shape or form interested in anything except really wringing the last cent out of the families of migrants and migrants themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the answer is not to stop these people's access to the courts. It is not to limit their access. The answer is to make sure that the decision making process in the department is right, that the decision making process in the tribunals is right and, if the member for Dunkley is right when he says that this is all about billable hours, to crack down on the people who give dud advice in the first place. It is pretty easy. If you are some suburban lawyer who has charged some poor devil $500, $1,000 or $5,000 and that person has not got any justice, you know that when the case fails they will not be around to go and see the Law Society; they will be on the plane out of the country. It is a terrific way to get rid of the people who are going to complain about you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the government says, `Let's limit the victim's chances.' The government is saying in this legislation, `Let's punish the people who may have had a mistake made against them.' If the government wants to say, `Punish the lawyers,' I will come in here and put my hand up for it. Or, if the government wants to say, `Punish the immigration agents double,' I will put my hand up for that three times.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the government says, as it is saying with a whole range of other things in this House, `Let's punish the victims.' Like it has done with the unemployed: `Let's take away their benefits.' Like it has done with poor people who want to go to the courts for other matters but have not got the ability: `Let's take away their legal aid. Let's punish the victims. Let's go out there and say in those great little Anglo&hyphen;Saxon seats like Dunkley, "Look, we're putting the stop on migration. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8294"> We've read the polls, we know you don't like it; we're doing our best."'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The truth is that that should not be done. The truth is that, in this case, there are people who have had genuine mistakes made against them, and to limit their right because they are non&hyphen;citizens is quite abhorrent. The unfortunate thing about this legislation is that it will not actually fix the problem that the government sees in this area. All it will be is a short&hyphen;cut method in the interests of saving time and money and the applicants will not get a fair review of the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To say that we should limit the rights of one group of people in Australia&mdash;those people who are non&hyphen;citizens and who want to appeal decisions to immigration tribunals&mdash;can take you down a slippery slope if you are not careful. Because who's next? Who else's rights might we want to circumscribe? Who else's rights might we want to take away from them?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my colleague at the table says, the veterans might be next. So where does all this take us? I guess one of the things that the government ought to think about when it looks at these polls that come out of Mr Morris's office&mdash;which tell you that you should not like migrants any more because that is unfashionable; you should put up a bit of a facade that says that these people do not contribute much and that they bring their parents here and put them on social security so you have got to stop all this, feeding into the ignorance generated by the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson)&mdash;and before it starts agreeing to pursue them is the effect that will have on the fabric of this country. Australia is a country coming to the centenary of its federation, the centenary of its life as a nation, in three years. We are one of the newest countries in the world. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, not all that many new countries have been created.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are a country of waves of migration. There are not too many people in this country who can say that they have more than five generations of their family here. As for those who can say they have more than five generations of their family here, those early genera 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tions were probably part of the criminal class of Britain. It is those waves of migration that have enriched this country. It is the waves of the compulsory immigrants from Britain and Ireland, it is the waves of free settlers from Britain and Ireland and it is those waves of significant post&hyphen;war migrants from Italy, Greece, Cyprus, the war&hyphen;torn countries of Europe and Britain. It is those waves of migrants to Australia in the sixties and seventies from the Middle East and from Asia in the seventies and eighties. Each one of those groups has added something to this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is rather interesting that this legislation will limit the rights of non&hyphen;citizens. Who is the largest group of non-citizens in this country? It is not the Greeks like the member for Kooyong. It is not the Irish like the member for Batman and me.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Or the Scots. It is not the Italians. It is the British. The largest single group of non&hyphen;citizens in this country is the British. So really the group of people who will probably be singly the most affected by this piece of legislation is all those British migrants who came here. Maybe they ought to go and have a talk with Mr Morris about that, because that probably was not in his poll when they said, `This will be terribly popular out there.' That is all this bit of legislation is about: cheap populism. It is about trying to send a message to the people who have been inspired by the member for Oxley to believe that the government is really onside with them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think there are parts of this area that need to be tightened up. The opposition said that and we said it while we were in government. But we believe that it should be tightened up at the front end, by the tribunal getting its decisions right and the department getting its decisions right, not by denying justice to someone who has been disadvantaged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The unfortunate thing about that concept of justice for the government is that, even if there are 10 dud ones and one right one, we should allow the system to be there to protect the person with a genuine grievance. We should not say, `There are too many duds in this system. We are going to wipe the system 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8295"> clean.' The government should rethink this. They should ensure that they fix the system up at the beginning and do not limit the rights of any group of people living in this country to get a free and fair review of their case by a judge who is not part of a system. If we take that right away, then it is a right that we will start taking away from others. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 5) was introduced during the last sitting of the House, shortly before the commencement of the second reading debate on another bill, the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1997.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Interesting as these changes may be, members will recall that the government moved some very important amendments to that bill prior to its passage through the House. In particular, the government responded to concerns about the possibility that measures included in the bill, which were designed to improve the speed and efficiency of the merits review process in the area of immigration, could have significant unintended downsides.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addressing these concerns, the government moved amendments guaranteeing the right of applicants seeking merits review of migration decisions to appear before the Refugee Review Tribunal and the newly created Migration Review Tribunal in person, subject to some appropriate restrictions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government also modified the provisions relating to the reconstitution of the two tribunals by their principal members, ensuring that such a reconstitution could take place only after consultation between the principal members and the other members of the tribunals within set time limits, prior to which no reconstitution could take place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very pleased that the shadow minister, the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson), supported the bill. However, he did intimate that the opposition had played some significant role in having these amendments made. I regret to say that this was not the case; in fact, it is my understanding that, prior to the second reading debate, these concerns had never been raised by the Labor Party in discussions with the minister. So, much as I 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> appreciate his attempts to boost the Labor Party's sensitivity in this regard, it is simply not so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the opposition did trigger was the removal from Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) provisions relating to the judicial review of migration decisions. Identical decisions now form the basis of Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 5), which is before us today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, the capacity of the courts to scrutinise the legality of administrative decisions made by the executive arm of government is an established and important part of the Australian judicial system. The capacity is enshrined in section 75(v) of the Australian Constitution and is embodied in legislation such as the Judiciary Act 1903 and the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977. It does provide an important check on the exercise of power by the executive arm of government and offers those people who are adversely affected by decisions of the executive an avenue through which to test the validity of those decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As important as the principle of judicial review is, however, it is obviously not possible for the courts to review every disputed administrative decision made by the Commonwealth and its officers. Moreover, given the high cost of legal action, it is unlikely that a system which depended exclusively on review of decisions by the courts would provide a genuine avenue of appeal for those affected by government decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Australia, particularly over the last two decades, these two realities have combined to shape a system of administrative law which relies upon a series of independent, informal and efficient review tribunals for dealing with disputes and in which judicial review is a last resort rather than a first port of call. This trend has been as apparent in the area of migration law as it has been in other areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During its 13 years in office the Labor government made a number of very substantial changes to the migration decision making and review process, moving from an essentially discretionary system to one based on legislation and regulation, introducing inde 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8296"> pendent tribunals to facilitate speedy and impartial review of migration decisions, and limiting the grounds on which applicants could use the provisions of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While these measures have undoubtedly been positive in many respects, they have failed to make any real impact on the number of migration cases being taken to the courts. Indeed, over the past 15 years, there has been an appreciable increase in the number of applications being made to the courts in migration matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the early 1980s the Federal Court received only about 30 applications for review of migration decisions each year. By the end of the decade this had increased to about 100 applications per year. In 1992 it was almost 200, in 1995 it was almost 400 and by last year it was almost 700.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This expansion reflects the fact that for a long time decisions about who could and who could not migrate to Australia were essentially left to the discretion of the minister for immigration, with the Migration Act 1958 giving no real hint as to how the various discretions could be exercised in individual cases. The fact was that very few such decisions were challenged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the coming into force of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act in October 1980, however, dissatisfied migration applicants for the first time had a substantial mechanism for seeking judicial review of these discretionary migration decisions. This newly available avenue of review, when combined with the lack of any effective and independent system for reviewing the merits of a particular decision, not surprisingly did lead to a swelling in the stream of applications to the courts. These factors were very much in the mind of the then Minister Assisting the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, the member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding), who said in his second reading speech on the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill 1989:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The wide discretionary powers conferred by the Migration Act have long been a source of public criticism . . . Accordingly this Bill proposes a decision&hyphen;making system in which policies govern 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ing entry to and stay in Australia will, for the first time, be spelt out in the migration legislative scheme . . . There has been dissatisfaction with the former review system, with the end result that in some instances, a number of applicants have considered that the only way they can gain an independent review of their case is to pursue judicial review. A new two&hyphen;tier review system is therefore proposed in the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In the very same speech, however, the then minister identified what would be the major shortcoming of the new regime:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Immigration is an unusual jurisdiction in that delay in decision&hyphen;making can work to the advantage of the applicant, at least where the applicant is already in Australia. Delay is compounded where the same matter is repeatedly reopened through fresh applications, reviews and appeals.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">However, the fact is that, by introducing a two&hyphen;tier review system but leaving open the option of further appeal to the courts, the 1989 bill, when passed, simply expanded the opportunities for those so inclined to delay the final decision on their immigration application.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not surprisingly, the number of applications for review by the Federal Court doubled in the space of only three years, necessitating further legislative change. I want to emphasise that this legislative change was made by the former Labor government and it came by way of the Migration Reform Bill 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In introducing the reform bill, the new Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Hand, highlighted the problem confronting the government, saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are people who are intent on bypassing the established categories of entry into this country . . . Owing to weaknesses which have been inherent in our migration laws for many years, these people are often successful. Many manage to stay here, even though they do not fall within the specific visa categories, which is the only lawful way to enter and stay in Australia. At the very least, many manage to delay the substantive decision on their case and, as a consequence, their departure, by using the courts to exploit any weaknesses they can find in our immigration law. This must stop.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Reflecting on the debate and particularly the statements made by members on the other side, I am stunned by the hypocrisy of those statements and by the gargantuan failure to recollect what happened only a couple of years ago.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8297">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill initiated by the Labor government, when passed, restricted the scope of the judicial review of migration decisions to situations where the applicant had pursued all available merits rights reviews. Furthermore, the possible grounds for judicial review were limited to failure to follow prescribed procedures, lack of jurisdiction by the decision maker, inconsistency of the decision with the act or regulations, proper exercise of power and so on. But a large number of claims including the denial of natural justice, unreasonableness, taking into account an irrelevant consideration, failing to take into account a relevant consideration and bad faith were specifically excluded as grounds for review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that, as I have already indicated, even those restrictions failed to make any appreciable impact on the trend to an increasing volume of recourse to the courts in migration matters. There are a number of reasons why this could have been the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, someone seeking to delay in the final determination of their case is unlikely to be perturbed by the fact that they can pursue judicial review only after all avenues of review have been used up and even then only on restricted grounds. Indeed, the fact is that, if delay is the objective, the existence of just about any grounds for review will prove sufficient to achieve this. Secondly, underlaying this judicial review mechanism, applications to the Federal Court have to be lodged strictly within 28 days, possibly leading to the filing of applications the merits of which have not been assessed. Thirdly, it strikes me as significant that the special 1 November 1993 announcement, which granted access to permanent residence to certain nationals of the People's Republic of China, Sri Lanka and the former Yugoslavia already resident in Australia, created an additional one&hyphen;off batch of contestable cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whatever interpretation is put on the situation, since the introduction of the Migration Reform Bill the simple fact is that the changes ushered in by the legislation had no discernible impact on the trend of increasing recourse to judicial review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the debate on the  Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1997  a fortnight 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ago, I highlighted the fact that this was an outcome which the current Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) had foreshadowed in 1992 when speaking on behalf of the coalition during the second reading debate on the Migration Reform Bill. I think this gives the lie to the assertions about the minister behaving inconsistently, out of character and in a fashion which he had only recently thought of, because in 1992 he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am disappointed that the Government has gone to water in relation to this matter, because the system that it seeks to put in place still provides access to a whole host of situations in which judicial review will be able to be obtained. That is a matter of concern to us.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I should say this was before anybody thought of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are concerned that the review system that the Government intends is one that all of the applicants will be able to access, whereas in our view it is only those who have arguable cases who should be able to obtain that access.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Indeed, not wishing to do the minister injustice, going back over the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  records of various debates on immigration legislation over the last decade, I found about a dozen occasions dating back to 1987 on which the minister cautioned the then government about the growth in the number of migration cases being taken to the courts. Again, I think this is important because a significant number of statements were, as usual, loosely made by the opposition, critical of the minister, which have absolutely no foundation in fact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No, this is not a response on the minister's part to the member for Oxley, to the shallow, wrong&hyphen;headed and dangerous arguments she makes. It is a consistent concern that he has had for a decade. And it is in line with this consistent approach that the coalition made a commitment prior to the 1996 election to limit access to the courts in all but exceptional cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill implements that commitment by restricting the grounds for judicial review of migration decisions to the question of whether the decision maker was acting within their jurisdiction and power in making the decision. A court will still be able to review matters, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8298"> but the available grounds will be confined to exceeding constitutional limits, narrow  jurisdictional errors and mala fides. The intention of the provision is to provide decision makers with wider lawful operation for their decisions such that provided that they are acting in good faith, have been given the authority to make the decision and do not exceed constitutional limits then the decision will be lawful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The consistency of the coalition's position on this issue stands in stark contrast with the hypocrisy which we have heard today and we heard in the last sitting from the Labor Party. The fact is that over a period of years, through a series of legislative measures, the Labor Party when in government sought to limit the incidence of judicial review in the area of migration law. That is incontrovertible to anybody who has any respect for the facts and has got the capacity to read <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The measures that they introduced differ from those now proposed by the government in degree. As the former member for Adelaide, Dr Catley, said in debate on the Migration Reform Bill 1992, the government was seeking to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . strike a better balance between the rights of people to clear justice and a fair hearing in our processes, as against the enabling of undue and extended delays in the lodging and processing of applications for residency status in this country . . . ensure that the judicial review of migration was available only on grounds which take into account the special nature of decision on the status of non&hyphen;citizens . . . and provides for a code for decision makers, and decision making, to replace the current common law rules of natural justice.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">But, as we have seen in a large number of areas, Labor in opposition is a very different creature to Labor in government&mdash;by the way, with some good and some bad effects&mdash;and it is my understanding that it will be opposing the bill. But, more than simply opposing the bill, some members of the Labor Party have sought to attribute to it a range of restrictions which are in fact already in place and have been put in place by the former Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), speaking on Migration Legislation Amend 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment Bill (No. 4) a fortnight ago, and he has echoed it today, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If you have only one process of review and something goes wrong in that review, then surely it should be possible to appeal to natural justice by going to the courts. If somebody has a reason why they feel the tribunal has made a determination which is contrary to natural justice or is contrary to their fundamental rights . . . all of these different reasons ought to be taken account of when looking at the possibility of going to a review process.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think it is worth while reminding the member for Calwell, and indeed members on the other side, that natural justice was specifically excluded as a valid ground for seeking judicial review by the Labor government in 1992. But the rewriting of history goes on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that, despite the misinformation and hypocrisy peddled by the opposition, I believe that this bill does bring about a reasonable reform, and a reform which is in the flow of movement of change to the Migration Act and migration matters. It should make a significant difference to the number of migration cases being taken to the courts, thus  avoiding lengthy and costly appeals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I would in conclusion sound one cautionary note. Of the 545 immigration matters resolved in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal or in the courts in 1995&hyphen;96, around 35 per cent were successful. As a proportion of a total of 3&half; million visa applications, this is not a huge number. But putting even 159 people on the wrong end of an incorrect decision on a matter which fundamentally affects their lives is something that I think all members would like to avoid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given this, I think the success of the reforms proposed by this bill and their full realisation will depend in part on the reforms included in Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) delivering an increase in the quality of the decisions being made at the primary level by the department and by the review tribunals. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to speak on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R300">Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1997</XREF> . Firstly, I would like to refer to the second reading speech of the Minister for Immigra 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8299"> tion and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock). The minister states that the bill gives legislative effect to the government's pre&hyphen;election policy commitment to restrict the access to judicial review in migration matters in all but exceptional circumstances. This is driven by a number of factors: the fact that there are extensive merits review rights in the migration area, and the growing cost and incidence of delays resulting from migration litigation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tool that the minister has used to achieve this end is a privative clause&mdash;clause 474. I say as well that the new judicial review scheme will also apply to the High Court and not just the Federal Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the bleatings on the other side of the House, Labor have attempted to do this in the past, unsuccessfully, and one can understand their embarrassment at their failure. In 1989 they made changes which offered a measure of certainty through codification and statutory merits review rights. This was unsuccessful. In 1994, part 8 of the act was brought in. Again, this did not stem the flow of those seeking a judicial solution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The recourse to the courts is trending upwards. The level of litigation, particularly by twice refused asylum claimants, is at present going unchecked. It seems that migrants and their legal representatives are intent on remaining litigious.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And why wouldn't they? It is one of the few areas of government where it is to the benefit of those seeking judicial redress to prolong the proceedings for as long as possible. The fact that many are entitled to Medicare and other benefits only increases their desire to continue to prolong the proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also heard from the other side of the House phrases such as these: `There is a cherished legal principle', `Natural justice is being denied' and `We will end up with a brawl with the High Court.' It has been made quite clear that the privative clause will not prevent any individual from going to the High Court. Their right to do so is not fettered by the privative clause at all. In fact, the High Court itself said that a privative matter is not really a narrowing of the review of the court but a broadening of the authority of the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> decision maker. I thought it was significant that the member for Kooyong (Mr Georgiou) mentioned that natural justice was not so important to the Labor Party back in 1992 when they removed this as a basis for judicial review. It seems that hypocrisy is the order of the day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to refer to some of the information put forward at the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee&mdash;and particularly to Mr Mark Sullivan's comments to that committee on Tuesday, 16 September 1997. With his very accurate overview of the difficulties in the migration system, he has shown that many of the claims made by those on the other side of the House are totally out of order.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1996&hyphen;97, of the 440 applications to the Federal Court, there were only eight successful applications. Sixty per cent of the Federal Court's caseload is to do with immigration. Significantly, 45 per cent of those who wish to go to the Federal Court withdraw before the hearing, indicating that what the minister said in his second reading speech is so: making an application to the Federal Court in these cases is often merely a device to delay for as long as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of the remaining 55 per cent of cases regarding immigration matters that go to the Federal Court, the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs wins 90 per cent. But, significantly, 95 per cent of the cost is not recovered. In fact, quite a number of those cases are funded by legal aid. The costs to the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs in 1996&mdash;which did not include the costs of legal aid, applicants' costs and the costs of the courts&mdash;amounted to $6.7 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the claims by those on the other side of the House that there is a cherished legal principle are simply not correct. People will still be able to take matters to the High Court. There is no denial of natural justice, because Labor has already done that&mdash;in 1992. There certainly will not be a brawl with the High Court, because their own interpretation of privative clauses is quite clear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Timing&mdash;the time that the present system takes&mdash;is another factor in the minister quite rightly moving to limit judicial review. Under 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8300"> the existing scheme, the MIRO takes 5&half; months to review a matter, with 6,000 cases per year. The Immigration Review Tribunal takes a further 11 months. So, to settle applications, there is a total of 16 months under the existing system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the new scheme, the Migration Review Tribunal will take six to eight months. So we will have one level of review&mdash;as opposed to two levels of review&mdash;with an improvement in processing time of 12 months. And there is always the opportunity to go to the minister in exceptional cases. As Mr Sullivan said&mdash;so rightly&mdash;to the senate committee, since the days of Arthur Calwell through to the Hon. Philip Ruddock, we have been fortunate to have had men of exceptional integrity and character to make a fair judgment in those cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What do the Australian people think of these changes? I can tell you what people in the electorate of Dawson think. Last year, when there was a significant payout through the immigration department which was settled out of court&mdash;and there was talk of some millions of dollars being involved, although that has not been confirmed&mdash;people in my electorate were furious. They rang the office and they wrote to me, and they said it was absolutely unacceptable that people who hoped to come to this country who were not Australian citizens&mdash;who were supposed refugees&mdash;were using and abusing the legal system in this country for their own ends. Australians are fair&hyphen;minded people. They do not mind people being able to make a fair appeal with a fair cost attached, but they are absolutely furious to see their taxpayer dollars being wasted on what in many cases are unsuccessful attempts to have a judicial review bring down a satisfactory outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This finding is not only from my own electorate It is interesting that in 1988 there was a survey commissioned by the Office of Multicultural Affairs. Senator Robert Ray, the then Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs declared in a news release that Australians supported multiculturalism. Certainly the survey seemed to indicate that, but it was very significant that in that survey a majority of respondents opposed 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> programs which provided special assistance for ethnic organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australians were very supportive of any moves to assist migrants to function effectively in Australia. They wanted to see English courses for migrant children and adults, information centres and interpreters in hospitals and courts. That was all quite proper. But they did not want to see waste. In fact, it is quite plain that the Australian people, fair-minded as they are, are very happy to help those who genuinely want to come to this country. They are not interested, though, in waste.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to share with you some of those costs. As I have already said, in 1995-96, $7.4 million was spent by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs on litigation for immigration and refugee decisions. As of 1 May this year, 590 active litigation cases were before the federal and high courts, 390 of which were refugee cases. The detention costs for boat people in 1996-97 were of the order of $10 million. In 1995-96, $16 million was spent on the asylum seeker assistance fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is significant that the estimated cost of keeping a detainee at an immigration detention facility in 1996-97 was around $137 a day. This year, to 30 June, 2,050 unlawful non&hyphen;citizens were admitted to Sydney, Melbourne and Perth detention facilities. Total detainee days were 84,741.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are the people for whom Labor wants to allow 16 months under the existing system to settle applications. These are the people whom the Labor Party is willing to give unfettered opportunity to use judicial review. It is not interested in seeing costs and delays brought back to a fair and reasonable level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The total accrued administrative and property cost for detainee days is estimated at $10 million. The total administrative and property cost for Port Hedland was estimated at $20.7 million for the year, including $7.2 million for capital works. This is timely legislation brought in by a minister who is well aware of the demand by the Australian people for fairness.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8301">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia is one of the most successful nations in the world in resettling migrants and refugees. Since 1945, 5.5 million people have come from over 150 countries, of which over half a million have arrived under humanitarian programs. Under the existing minister, Mr Ruddock, we have a non-discriminatory migration policy. That means that anyone from any country can apply, regardless of their ethnic origin, their sex, their race or their religion. It is an entirely non-discriminatory program. The only criteria are based on the applicants' ability to meet certain selection criteria, which again are very balanced and fair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To the minister's credit, he has moved the program more into line with the expectations of the Australian people. There is a continued emphasis on skilled migration and less on family preference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For this financial year the total planning level of 80,000 comprises 68,000 in the migration program and 12,000 in the humanitarian program. This has declined from the previous two years when the total was 74,000 in 1996&hyphen;97 and 83,000 in 1995-96. Over 35,000 places will be reserved for skilled migration in the 1997-98 program, compared with 28,000 last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister recognises that Australians are appreciative of those who have the skills to very quickly assimilate into our country, to find work and to have a satisfying and fulfilling life in this country. I see that quite clearly in the seat of Dawson. I noticed that one of the members on the other side made a jibe about those members with Anglo&hyphen;Celtic electorates. My electorate is blessed with people of many different ethnic origins&mdash;Italian, Maltese, South Sea Islanders, Filipino, Chinese, Greek, and many more that I could not mention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Forty per cent of the descendants in the Mackay area are of Maltese extraction. They came here in the early days of the cane industry. They cut cane by hand, built their homes and reared their children. They have been a significant factor in the success of the sugar cane industry in North Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We now have the Maltese Festival in Mackay, one of few in Australia, and it is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> very successful. Up in the Burdekin we have a large population of Italian descent. Again, they enrich that area with their culture and customs and make a significant contribution to the economic welfare and benefits in the Burdekin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are very fortunate. We do not even talk about multiculturalism. Everyone in the area of Dawson is an Australian and a North Queenslander and jolly proud of it. They appreciate and share with us the cultural gifts that they have brought to this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased that we have a minister who realises the benefits and richness that other cultures bring to this country and who is intent on delivering an honest immigration program that reflects the aspirations of the Australian people. I commend our minister, and commend the bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I would like to take this opportunity of thanking the members who have contributed to this debate: the shadow minister, the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson), the members for Longman (Mr Brough), Calwell (Dr Theophanous), Dunkley (Mr Billson), Kooyong (Mr Georgiou), Watson (Mr Leo McLeay) and Dawson (Mrs De-Anne Kelly). I have been particularly gratified by the quality of contributions by my colleagues on this side of the House. I think they have very effectively highlighted a number of issues which are important and which ought not be lost sight of in debating the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R300">Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1997</XREF> .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make a number of short points to make it abundantly clear that the government's approach is not one to see bona fide refugees who have made claims in Australia being refouled. I am the minister, and I give instructions to my departmental officers and to the Refugee Review Tribunal members, whom I recently addressed, that it is my intention that people who have bona fide claims should be accepted. There should be no ambiguity about that. I would expect that Refugee Review Tribunal members would conscientiously discharge their obligations, as I would my department.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8302">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question you have to look at in the light of the very significant growth in the numbers of claims that have been made&mdash;and we expect something of the order of 10,000 claims for refugee status this year&mdash;is that refugee status is being seen as the basis upon which people who come here, essentially as visitors, intend to make applications to remain here either temporarily or permanently. I have been asked by the Senate to produce some information about the numbers of people who apply for visas at offices onshore. I will be making that information available, probably in the course of the day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To get some idea of the numbers involved, for 1996-97 in Sydney and Melbourne offices of my department 8,213 people applied for protection visas. The only other class that gets anywhere near it are those who apply on spouse grounds. Essentially, many of them have been properly visaed for that purpose when they have applied as a fiance. It surprises me that there is this enormous growth in protection claims. That is against something of the order of 500 claims that we used to see when the former government was first elected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point I want to make about that process is that delay for some people achieves their objective. If your objective is to be a guest worker in Australia, that is your principal objective&mdash;not protection but a guest worker. The more people who apply, the longer the delays. The benefit you derive from being able to put an application into the system is the opportunity to be employed, to work in Australia and very often to remit money out of Australia. That is the objective, and that is what you are able to achieve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In many cases you are also able to get access to Medicare benefits in Australia. If you need an operation or an expensive treatment, it can be carried out freely in Australia at the expense of Australian taxpayers. It is known that numbers of people come to Australia with that as an objective and lodge protection claims in order to be able to access those services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Interestingly, we sought to deny that opportunity and introduced regulations in the Senate to do so. One of the first decisions taken by the Labor Party and senators was to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> disallow that measure. We have in place for bona fide asylum seekers the provision for medical care and support. But, in addition, they get access to Medicare. That is something that the Senate has not yet been prepared to address. It is something that I hope the Senate will be prepared to address when we see regulations on that matter again on another occasion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A further point I want to make is that, in providing access to review here in Australia and access to our courts, we are providing access to people who are not citizens of this country. What we are saying is, `You are entitled to every opportunity to exploit every loophole in the law&mdash;supported in many cases by Australian taxpayers through the legal aid system&mdash;and you are entitled to do it notwithstanding the fact that you broke our law in coming to Australia and that you are not a citizen of this country.' What we are talking about is the access to our courts by non-citizens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to conclude my remarks of a general character in relation to this matter by making one other point. I do have a discretion under section 417 of the Migration Act. It is a responsibility that lies very heavily on my shoulders, and I discharge it with care and a great deal of attention. At the end of the day not only do I tell my officers that I do not want anybody who has bona fide claims refouled but also, as the minister, I expect to be informed about any marginal case and for such a case to be able to be dealt with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Beyond that, we are talking about a situation where people come here and make claims that are being improperly pursued. Interestingly, the shadow minister suggested in his comments that he was unaware that claims were being improperly pursued. I think that comment can, at best, be described as naive, given the number of times I have commented on this issue. The fact is that we have a system which provides for a first-tier application to my department and a second-tier review by the Refugee Review Tribunal. Most of those people rejected go to the Refugee Review Tribunal, if you look at the numbers. Then we provide access to our courts.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8303">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Access to the courts does not provide you with just one tier of review; it provides you with consideration by a Federal Court judge, consideration by the Full Federal Court of Australia as well as the opportunity to go to the High Court of Australia. It is a fact that people who have been unsuccessful at every level have taken the opportunity to take their decisions every part of the way. After that, they still have access to me. The question is: is that reasonable when you know it is being abused? I do not consider it is reasonable. The former government did not consider it reasonable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Kooyong highlighted the hypocrisy of the Labor Party in pressing this opposition on a privative clause when it is abundantly clear that the measures that they enacted, which were designed to achieve a limitation on access to the courts, are failing. The current judicial review scheme&mdash;part 8 of the Migration Act&mdash;is seeing an increase in the incidence and cost of litigation. In other words, the applications are going up. The Labor Party sought to limit access to the courts. In 1994&hyphen;95 there were 400 applications, in 1995&hyphen;96 there were 600 applications and in 1996&hyphen;97 there were 749 applications. A recent Federal Court case, the most important of which is Eshetu's case, has found that the grounds for judicial review which were sought to be excluded by part 8 of the Migration Act&mdash;the sections implemented by the former government&mdash;such as unreasonableness, are now available to review tribunal decisions. So where the former government sought to close it off, the courts have now overturned it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have made some comments on this matter. The honourable member for Batman referred to an article written by Steketee in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>. He has pursued a little campaign against the principal member of the Refugee Review Tribunal in relation to some temporary appointments that were made. This matter was picked up by the honourable member for Batman. The fact is that the principal member of the Refugee Review Tribunal, Mr Shun Chetty, was himself a refugee who fled South Africa because he was defending the rights of those who were in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> opposition to the apartheid system. He was a very distinguished officer of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, and he was appointed by the previous government. I do have confidence in Mr Chetty. I am very surprised that the member for Batman would bring into question such a distinguished appointment, which was made by their government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I am giving the tribunal a further chance. As I said to Mr Steketee some time ago when he wrote the article, if we are going to have a system in which people are able to access genuine merit review then in my considered opinion access to the courts is no longer necessary. But if we are going to have a system in which the courts insist that they have a continuing role because of the constitution then I have to question whether or not we need an expensive merit review system. If the courts are going to provide the system of review through three tiers of review, why do you spend $15 million on a Refugee Review Tribunal providing independent merit advice?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Calwell picked up in the course of the debate a matter that I had raised about the tribunal itself. He was suggesting that it was appropriate to have a system which included both administrative and judicial review and that the UNHCR would support that. There is nothing that I have seen published by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in its ex com decision making that suggests that there should be a multiple system available&mdash;in other words, administrative review on top of judicial review. It makes it abundantly clear that it expects it only in the alternative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that the system which we have inherited is one in which Labor's attempts at containing abuse have proven unsuccessful. We need a multifaceted approach to this issue. I have brought forward amendments, which the opposition has indicated it will support not only in this House but also in the Senate, to reform the administrative review arrangements generally. But they are not enough in themselves. What we want to do is to be able to restore public confidence in the way the review system is working.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8304">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian community should know that of the order of $60 million a year is spent on dealing with the review of asylum claims within Australia&mdash;detaining people who arrive here illegally&mdash;and their repatriation. The Australian people should appreciate that there is also a cost when people access judicial review. We spend all this money on a review system. In comparison, we spend of the order of $20 million on bona fide refugees who are taken from some of the most deprived situations around the world, in concert with assisting other migrants who come to Australia and their resettlement. In comparison with the amount of money we give to the UNHCR for its wider work, again the $60 million is infinitesimal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we really care about refugees we would be about identifying those who have a need for our support here and we would be about giving more support to those who are abroad. But we would not be about this growth in refugee accommodation within Australia. At the moment of the order of 2,000 people are expected to come through that system in the course of the next year. These numbers bear no relationship to what we saw in times of genuine refugee concern when people were fleeing oppression in far greater numbers in other parts of the world. This is a new phenomenon for Australia. The Labor Party&mdash;I have to say this to the honourable member for Batman&mdash;is about giving comfort and succour to those who are exploiting these individuals and to those individuals who are exploiting the Australian system for their own advantage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to the honourable member that if you want an issue about immigration which the misinformed can exploit, you leave these issues open, you fail to give the government support on a bill of this sort and you leave open the whole system to be attacked by those who have other motives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not intend to leave the system flawed. I intend to ensure that the system is run with integrity. I intend to ensure that the former government's measures to contain abuse of our judicial system are given effect. I want to assure the House that I am intent on ensuring that those people who are genuine are accom 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> modated and at the end of the day there is a safety net; and that safety net is me, as minister. I will continue to be conscientious about the way in which that is implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You find a very interesting picture when you look at the outcome in relation to refugee applications going before the courts of Australia. I have the figures here for 1993-94, 1994-95, 1995-96 and 1996-97. Let me take the honourable member through it because I think it is exceedingly educational in terms of what we are spending and what the outcome is and whether or not the safety net of section 417 would work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that in 1993-94 there were 1,437 cases affirmed&mdash;that is, decisions taken by my department and affirmed by the RRT. There were 53 applications to the Federal Court. In relation to that one case that was remitted by the Federal Court to the RRT for a reconsideration, the reconsideration led to a refusal again. In 1994-95 a total of 2,333 applications were affirmed and there were 204 applications to the Federal Court. You can see the growth. Twenty-eight were remitted by the Federal Court to the RRT. As a result of that recommittal, four favourable decisions were obtained. In 1995-96 there were 2,741 applications, 282 cases to the Federal Court, 53 were remitted to the RRT and nine resulted in favourable reconsideration by the tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1996-97 there were 3,497 applications affirmed by the RRT, 440 applications to the Federal Court and 61 remitted to the RRT as the court started to expand its view as to the natural justice issues it wanted addressed, and eight resulted in favourable reconsiderations. That is a total of 20 over four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at the Federal Court costs, you are probably talking about $25 million or thereabouts. I am just collating the figures; I think it is $7 million a year in court costs, so $25 million is probably fairly right, and we have less than 20 cases which involve favourable consideration. It puts it in some sort of perspective, I suspect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The privative clause is one that we believe will work. We have had opinions from very eminent counsel, admittedly&mdash;two distinguished former Attorneys-General, Tom Hughes and Bob Ellicott, from Richard 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8305"> Tracey, David Bennett and Dennis Rose. They tell me that it is constitutional and they tell me that it is legal. I have had advice that we will not be in breach of our international obligations through implementing this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would hope, in terms of the sort of respect that we gave when we were in opposition to the government's desire to deal with these matters sensibly and in the national interest, that the opposition would reconsider its position on this matter and recognise that there is a need for fundamental reform and that they are riding the wrong horse if they think there is any support in the community for the abuse that has been occurring in this area. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Taxation Laws Amendment (Foreign Income Measures) Bill is not contentious in principle, and is supported by the opposition. The general thrust of the legislation is to protect the Australian tax base by tightening up the rules governing certain types of foreign source income earned by Australian residents. Of course, it also gives me an opportunity to recount to the House and to the Australian people some of the hypocrisy of the coalition on the issue of international tax avoidance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By way of background, the current regime for taxing foreign source income was introduced by Labor to ensure that Australians were properly taxed on income earned outside Australia. Prior to these major structural reforms, the payment of tax on overseas investments made by Australian residents was, in practice, largely optional. So, if you were Premier Jeff Kennett and were lucky enough to get yourself some Guangdong shares, you did not have to pay tax on the income that you got for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1975 the Asprey committee recommended the introduction of a comprehensive system of foreign tax credits under which the foreign source income of Australian residents would be subject to Australian tax and a credit given for the foreign tax paid on that income. This was one of the many taxation issues that Prime Minister Howard, when he was Treasurer, did not tackle. Equitable tax reform in this area of foreign income was not introduced by the Fraser government; it had to be introduced by the Hawke Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After stalling on the issue for years the Fraser government announced in 1978 that, on both equity and efficiency grounds, it would be following the Asprey committee recommendation. However, in typical fashion, it abandoned the proposal in the face of opposition from big business in both Australia and overseas. So this blatantly unfair situation continued for a further decade until a decent government, a Labor government, had the courage and the conviction to reform and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> modernise the tax system, especially its international aspects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were three factors contributing to this previous totally unsatisfactory situation. First, there was the deficient legal regime. Until 1987 paragraph 23Q of the assessment act governed whether or not foreign source income, except for dividends, was subject to Australian tax. This provision granted an exemption for foreign source income which had borne any foreign tax, including withholding tax. Indeed, income was exempt in Australia under this provision, even if it did not bear foreign tax but was not exempt from foreign tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, in practice, foreign investments were often structured to ensure some low level of foreign tax was paid, so that no Australian tax was payable. This regime made no distinction between the offshore source of the income; all investments were treated equally, whether sourced in a high&hyphen;taxed OECD nation or through the most notorious tax haven. Of course, the distinction for dividends was largely academic because, if an Australian company received a dividend, it would be tax free anyway because of the dividend rebate regime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the actual legal regime that applied generally applied only to income which was remitted back to Australia. So investment income could accumulate offshore outside the tax net quite legitimately for those with significant means. Meanwhile, honest PAYE taxpayers, who worked for their income, had to contribute their tax week in and week out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third aspect of this system was the lack of information to enable Australian tax authorities to ensure that offshore investments were complying with Australian tax law, weak as it was at this time. There were only a small number of double tax conventions entered into by Australia relative to the current situation, and there was a generally poor level of international cooperation by taxation authorities compared with the current situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So tax was, in fact, optional for those wealthy enough to be able to invest offshore. This anomalous situation was noted in the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8307"> draft white paper on taxation reform issued by the government in 1985. At page 230 that report noted how unfair the prevailing system was. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Revenue consequences aside, these exemptions are inequitable where the foreign income tax is lower than the Australian income tax that would otherwise be payable. It can result in markedly different tax levels as between two resident taxpayers with the same amount of income, in the one case derived from Australian sources, and in the other from foreign. The exemption runs counter to neutrality objectives, providing a tax induced incentive for investment abroad rather than in Australia. At the same time the exemption affords an incentive to avoid tax by arranging to give income an artificial source overseas.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The reforms introduced by Labor to address these anomalies were comprehensive. They comprised, firstly, the foreign tax credit system. I indicated earlier that this was a minimum reform to ensure some justice, which the Fraser government could not achieve, even though it knew it should have done so. When this legislation came before the Senate, the then opposition voted against the proposals&mdash;that is, the coalition yet again sided with those who were not paying their fair share of income tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, there were the controlled foreign company, or CFC, measures. The controlled foreign company measures tax Australian shareholders on their pro rata share of a controlled foreign company's tainted income, the passive income&mdash;for example, interest, royalties, et cetera&mdash;or related party sales income, whether or not that income is remitted back to the Australian shareholder. This is an important measure to ensure that moneys invested in foreign businesses cannot be accumulated in tax havens outside of the Australian tax net and acts in addition to the foreign tax credit system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, there are the foreign investment fund measures. The foreign investment fund measures apply to Australian shareholders who have an interest, but not a controlling interest, in a foreign entity, a company or a trust, that is not caught by the CFC or transferor trust measures. These rules ensure that passive offshore investment, say in an international share trust, cannot escape taxation where equivalent investment behaviour, say 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in the Australian share market through a domestic share trust, would be subject to Australian tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, Labor changed the law to introduce the transferor trust measures and other measures to ensure that the taxation of interests in non-resident trusts is fair. The transferor trust measures attribute the income of a non-resident trust to an Australian resident who has transferred some value to the trust, and that is a broad parallel to the CFC, or controlled foreign company, system concerning companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So Labor has a proud record of cleaning up rorts in this area of international tax avoidance and the coalition has a disgraceful record. Given this background, the opposition was pleasantly surprised when we saw the discussion paper released in December of last year on the issues and the final decisions announced in the 1997 budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition appear to have accepted the reforms made by Labor. While I condemn their previous obstructive actions, I welcome this change of direction. The process of keeping the tax system fair is an ongoing process. Bills such as the one before us today are part of the day-to-day work necessary to keep the tax net as free from holes as possible while still encouraging investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The aspects of the current arrangements that will be reformed by this bill include alterations to the current listing arrangements for comparable tax countries. Currently, both the controlled foreign company and transferor trust regimes and the foreign tax credit system use the same list of comparable tax countries which provides too lenient treatment for the controlled foreign companies. The list for the controlled foreign company and transferor trust regimes will be reduced from approximately 50 nations to seven, to be known as the broad exemption list, to reflect the fact that there are many countries on the current list that do not consistently levy tax on a truly comparable basis to Australia. These countries will be known as limited exemption listed countries. The foreign tax credit system exemptions will be available on both broad exemption listed countries and limited exemption listed countries.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8308">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, there are measures which will purportedly reduce compliance costs. Various measures are being implemented which the government claims will simplify the rules concerning calculation of income from interests in the controlled foreign companies, thereby hopefully reducing compliance costs. Of course, the goal of reducing compliance costs in all areas of regulation is shared by the opposition so long as standards are maintained. I do note various comments reported in the media about the actual effect of this legislation from some of the industry experts who will have to implement it. For example, Mr Ian Farmer, a Coopers &amp; Lybrand tax partner, is reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 11 July to have said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The changes will require companies to conduct more detailed annual reviews of their overseas subsidiaries and will increase compliance costs.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In addition, a tax partner with Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, Mr Duncan Baxter, is also reported as saying `You've got to be joking,' when asked if the measures would reduce compliance costs. So just like the failure of the government to deliver on its commitment to halve the compliance costs and red tape for small business, there is certainly some doubt as to whether this legislation will actually reduce the compliance costs of Australian firms investing overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, there are changes to the treatment of branch income of Australian companies operating overseas. The branches of Australian firms in a limited exemption listed country will face tougher rules for exemption of certain types of income. The taxation of branch income of Australian financial institutions will generally be brought more into line with the treatment of Australian financial institutions under the CFC regime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, there are various consequential changes and transitional rules in the bill which are supported by the opposition. For example, taxpayers will have the option to treat states emerging from the dissolution of listed countries, for example from the former Czechoslovakia, the USSR or Yugoslavia, as listed countries. Finally, there are changes to the foreign investment funds rules. The existing exemption for approved country 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> funds is to be repealed and additional stock exchanges&mdash;Bogota, Colombo, Zimbabwe, Bratislava&mdash;are to be added to the list of approved stock exchanges. The estimated revenue flowing from all of the above measures combined is said to be $125 million in 1998&hyphen;99, and $100 million in subsequent years. The opposition does not oppose these measures.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given its small population, Australia has a very complex foreign source income tax law&mdash;so complex that I sometimes wonder if the real aim of the legislation is to discourage Australians from making `overseas investments'.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was the comment of one well-known Australian tax expert in a recent editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Accountant</EMPHASIS>  in response to the government's proposed amendments to the foreign source income legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition asserts that the amendments proposed in this bill will substantially simplify the current foreign source income laws and therefore facilitate Australian investment abroad. However, that proposition stands in marked contrast to the views of the tax fraternity, who are united, it seems to me, in their criticism of many aspects of this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The controlled foreign company, CFC, provisions were first enacted in 1988 to prevent taxpayers earning passive or tainted income from escaping Australian taxes on income arrived at in those countries that do not tax companies at a level akin to the Australian company tax rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Income Tax Assessment Act has allowed for the development of a list of countries, which currently includes 61 nations, that are deemed to have a comparable tax regime at least for the time being. The government argues that this list is now excessively long and poses difficulties when monitoring the designation of tax deferred opportunities. This legislation will see this existing list divided into two. The first list, or the new list as it is to be called, will be severely restricted and will include only seven count 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8309"> ries that are to continue to receive the current tax treatment. They are the United States of America, the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, Canada, New Zealand and France. These seven countries have been set apart by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) on the basis that they have demonstrated a commitment to taxing tainted income as well as implementing their own domestic CFC systems. The other 54 nations will be sidelined to the new repatriation list, which will see them granted a continued exemption for non&hyphen;portfolio dividends, but the unlisted active income test will now apply to all their CFCs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A paper prepared for the University of New South Wales ATAX Masters of Taxation at a course earlier this year by the international tax group at Arthur Andersen has expressed concern at the inequity in the composition of the new list members. Firstly, Arthur Andersen suggests that the information paper about this bill failed to explicitly state the membership criteria for inclusion on that list. Arthur Andersen also indicates that, while the seven countries that have made it on to the list meet the inferred criteria, this is true also of many other countries that have not been granted new list status. Arthur Andersen has asked, `Why has preferred taxation status been given to countries such as France while other comparably taxed countries, including Scandinavia and Italy, have not been given this status?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Another inconsistency is that, while all seven countries on the new list do have domestic CFC regimes in place&mdash;as seems to be one of the government's membership criteria&mdash;this is also true of another six countries that will be dropped to the repatriation list. As I have already said, the catalyst for the drafting of the two separate lists is the claim that the current system complicates the monitoring process. Yet the government has failed to adequately explain how two separate lists containing a total of 61 countries can be any easier to manage than a single list that has the same number of countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, as Ernst and Young has noted, no resources have been made available by the government to monitor tax concessions 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> provided in the present group of listed countries. Ernst and Young suggests:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is difficult to appreciate the inability to identify tax deferral opportunities as there are many publications which provide such information and tax journals which monitor new concessions.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Ernst and Young group goes on to note that successive federal governments have ratified a number of double&hyphen;tax treaties over the past seven years and that these would have afforded the opportunity to review the tax concessions available to the treaty partners without the complex process put forward in this bill. However, the government seems determined not to take expert advice, insisting instead on further complicating an already incomprehensible tax act with these amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill does, however, bring about a number of improvements to the taxation of foreign source income. The Arthur Andersen group has suggested that one `substantial benefit' of these amendments will be observed in the active income test measures for a controlled foreign company resident in a country that ceases to be a listed country. Currently, a CFC's active income in a listed country takes into account only the eligible designated concession income, and usually only tainted income&mdash;that is, passive amounts and income from certain related transactions with Australian residents&mdash;has been determined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The result of this has been that the tainted income ratio of a company in a foreign country usually works out to be either nothing or 100 per cent&mdash;nothing in between. This was not the intent of the original legislation and the proposed amendments will see this change for the better. However, the representatives from Arthur Andersen also note:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current anomaly will continue for the proposed CFC listed countries, and, in our view, the anomaly should have been removed long ago, and is not dependent on the changes proposed in the information paper.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">One of the more glaring inconsistencies in the bill relates to the coalition's supposed commitment to reducing the regulatory burden on business and investment communities. If we are to believe the government, one of the explicit aims of this legislation is to reduce 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8310"> the cost to business of compliance and yet, as Mr Robert Richards observed in the March 1997 edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Accountant</EMPHASIS> :</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In an attempt to counter possible tax avoidance by a small group of taxpayers . . . the government will make the law even more complex for all those Australian companies carrying on genuine business in non&hyphen;listed countries.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Richards went on to note that the government has failed to provide any evidence of the extent of the so&hyphen;called rorting and that as a result:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All such companies will be subject to complex and burdensome laws, designed to counter some unspecified problem, and to relieve the tax office of what presumably are its responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Ernst and Young have echoed that sentiment, noting that the government has offered only `vague comments' in relation to the supposed compliance benefits that this legislation will confer on business. Their paper asks:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is it really anticipated that compliance costs will be reduced with the introduction of a further 35 pages of complicated legislation?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Anyone who followed the debate on the changes to the research and development tax concession last year will remember that the government was attacked by industry groups on this very same point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is totally unacceptable that the Treasurer continues to refuse to substantiate his claims of widespread abuse of the tax system. How can the government expect anyone to take its financial impact statement seriously if it continues to refuse to provide information as to how it costs the extent of the problem?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ernst and Young have indicated that, while this bill is the first to bring about substantial changes to the controlled foreign companies rules since they were introduced in 1988, it does not simplify the rules. Furthermore, Ernst and Young have criticised the government for its failure to ensure that its proposals form a part of a consistent approach to changes to taxation legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Chapter 5 of the information paper indicates that the application of the existing active income test for unlisted country CFCs to those on the repatriation list will reduce compliance costs. Arthur Andersen, however, points out:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">More types of income are included in the unlisted CFC active income tests and this would be expected to increase the monitoring and calculation costs of Australian shareholders.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They go on to observe that the likely impact of this change on Australian taxpayers with repatriation list CFCs will be a significantly more complex system of determining which credits are to be brought forward or transferred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This point was also argued by Mr Ian Farmer&mdash;I notice the previous speaker, the member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson) referred to him&mdash;a partner at Coopers and Lybrand. Mr Farmer says that any Australian company that has a subsidiary in those countries on the repatriation list will be required to maintain a comprehensive analysis of their profit and loss accounts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the 2 July 1997 edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, Mr Farmer is reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a number of cases there will be no income taxable in Australia but a lot of time will have to be spent investigating the accounts.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Not only is there doubt about whether these amendments will reduce compliance costs for Australian businesses, but also some tax experts are predicting that they will actually compound the compliance burden.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another major inconsistency in this government's taxation policy can be seen in the treatment of tax sparing arrangements. On 26 March this year, the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister, the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles), introduced the International Tax Agreements Amendment Bill 1997. That bill sought to enhance Australia's business opportunities in Vietnam by providing tax sparing arrangements for specific Vietnamese tax concessions. At the time, I noted that double&hyphen;tax agreements are generally supported by Australian tax experts who acknowledge that they are an integral part of our internationalisation. The bill, which granted tax sparing relief for income from construction and infrastructure projects in Vietnam, was assented to on 19 June this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 24 December 1996, only three months before the introduction of that bill, the Treas 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8311"> urer announced the release of the government's information paper on the bill that we are talking about today. His press release read, in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has reviewed the provision of tax sparing . . . and proposes that Australia's position be that tax sparing generally not be provided in future agreements and existing provisions generally not be renewed on expiry.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There is nothing equivocal in that statement&mdash;yet only 12 weeks after that announcement was made the government introduced and ensured the safe passage of a piece of legislation that runs contrary to its stated position on legitimate tax concessions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Chapter 6 of the government's information paper on this bill justifies the withdrawal of future tax sparing arrangements on the basis that `it provides opportunities for tax avoidance, especially in relation to highly mobile income and assets'. If the government was so concerned about the effects of tax sparing arrangements, why did it endorse the double&hyphen;tax treaty between Australia and Vietnam earlier this year?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The international tax group at Arthur Andersen suggested in a paper published in the March 1997 edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Tax Week</EMPHASIS> that the government's reasons for rejecting, in general, all tax sparing seems an excessive reaction. That particular viewpoint is consistent with one published by Ernst and Young. They said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rather than stating that tax sparing will not be provided in the future, it would (have been) more appropriate to ensure that the terms of future tax sparing relief are drafted to minimise avoidance opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As another tax expert suggested, it is a bit rich for the government to specifically provide for tax sparing arrangements and then to condemn those who take advantage of them by labelling them as tax cheats. The Commissioner of Taxation does it time and time again and it has never been contested by anyone in this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has a long way to go if Australia is to compete for increasingly mobile investment capital in the future. Multinationals will not be encouraged to locate their regional headquarters here until 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this government begins to show signs that it has a proven commitment to an integrated industry policy and a competitive taxation framework.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dr Vince FitzGerald, executive director of the Allen Consulting Group, was recently quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Making Australia a more competitive place to invest, do business and create jobs must be a key aim of reform and it must involve a shift from taxing business and earning to taxing spending.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There are many flaws in this bill and it is therefore difficult to see how the changes it seeks to bring about will do anything to make Australia a more attractive place in which to do business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Additionally, it is questionable whether the benefits that will be brought about by this bill will outweigh the additional compliance burden for Australian businesses. For that reason I intend to register a dissenting vote at the second reading. I will close by quoting from the summary of the paper prepared by the Arthur Anderson group, which makes the point:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposals fail to recognise the growing investment in the Asian region, and impose an unjustified additional tax compliance burden on companies seeking to take advantage of the opportunities in this region.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I would just like to make a few comments in conclusion and specifically address a couple of the issues raised by both of the speakers who have participated in this debate. The proposed changes will improve the effectiveness of the rules for the accruals taxation of foreign source income and thereby help ensure that investments offshore are not favoured over similar investments in Australia for purely taxation reasons. Improving the effectiveness of the rules will also help stem the erosion of the Australian tax base that could otherwise occur through payments from Australian profits to foreign subsidiaries. In this regard, the changes are expected to result in a revenue gain of $125 million in the 1998&hyphen;99 financial year and $100 million for subsequent years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8312">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The creation of a shorter list of countries for providing exemptions from accrual taxation could, however, result in some increase in overall compliance costs for companies and trusts in limited exemption listed countries. These costs are considered necessary to protect the revenue. Both speakers raised the issues about compliance costs and I would make these comments in particular in regard to the advice given to me on these areas. The CFCs conducting an active business in a country which ceases to be listed for accruals taxation purposes are also unlikely to be significantly affected by the changes because accruals taxation will apply only to tainted amounts and then only if these amounts exceed five per cent of the CFC's gross turnover.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The compliance costs arising from the proposed changes will therefore be primarily borne by companies with significant amounts of tainted income and then only in relation to that tainted income. These companies are the legitimate targets of the CFC measures. I think that is a fair comment: they are a legitimate target for these measures. Efforts have been made to keep compliance costs under CFC measures at a minimum. It is, however, necessary to address tax deferral opportunities for tainted income derived offshore to ensure that competitive investment opportunities in Australia are not overlooked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The decision to not entirely abandon a list of companies for the purposes of providing exemptions from accruals taxation will continue to help reduce compliance costs. Many companies will not be affected by the changes because the proposed broad exemption list includes most of the major financial centres and countries where the bulk of Australia's investment abroad is located.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also relevant to note that most of the additional compliance burden will be borne by the Australian controllers of foreign companies that derive significant amounts of tainted income. These companies are the legitimate target, as I have already mentioned, of the controlled foreign company measures. Compliance costs will not increase, however, for all foreign companies controlled by Australian residents. The changes being made 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to help reduce compliance costs under controlled foreign companies measures are likely to result in an overall reduction in compliance costs for most companies in broad exemption listed countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second speaker also suggested that more countries should be added to the broad exemption list. A robust list of closely comparable tax countries is crucial for the purposes of providing exemptions from accruals taxation because the list is only as strong as its weakest link. If non&hyphen;comparable countries are included on the list or if countries are listed but tax concessions not identified, tainted income, by its nature, can easily be diverted from Australia to take advantage of lower tax rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new broad exemption list comprising Canada, France, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States will continue to significantly reduce compliance costs under the CFC measures because the list includes most of the major financial centres and countries where the bulk of Australian investment abroad is located. The countries on the proposed broad exemption list have a demonstrated commitment to taxing tainted income as it accrues and have tax rates and bases comparable to Australia's. These countries also have well&hyphen;developed tax administrations and where tax concessions are provided they are clearly defined and transparent.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R280">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1997</XREF>  is the fourth omnibus taxation bill for this year. It covers a variety of issues which can be grouped into anti&hyphen;avoidance measures&mdash;amendments to the new simplified Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 aligning it with the former Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and a collection of other unrelated matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Turning to the anti&hyphen;avoidance measures first, I wish to indicate that the opposition supports these proposals in principle. We do, however, have some questions on the precise impact of these proposals and we will be seeking to have these examined publicly in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first area that the bill goes to is what is referred to as `thin capitalisation'. The first anti&hyphen;avoidance measure involves tightening the thin capitalisation provisions. These provisions were in fact first introduced by Labor and limit the amount of interest deductions allowed to firms with foreign debt to ensure the integrity of the Australian company tax base.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill is proposing change in a number of respects to the thin capitalisation regime, specifically that the general gearing, that is debt to equity ratio, is to be reduced from three to one to two to one for non&hyphen;financial institutions. The definition of foreign debt is to be broadened, the rules for trusts and partnerships are to be tightened and the specific anti&hyphen;avoidance provisions are to be repealed. As I indicated, we support these changes in principle, but we are concerned that the rules may have some unintended consequences for some important investments. This is an issue that the opposition hopes the Senate, in its proper role of close examination of legislation, will look at it in greater detail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second anti&hyphen;avoidance measure in the bill concerns finance share rorts&mdash;that is to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> say, it contains proposals aimed at stopping abuse of the finance share provisions. Australian financial institutions&mdash;we do not know how many&mdash;have apparently been abusing the concessions available to so&hyphen;called eligible finance shares and widely distributed finance shares by converting payments which are, in effect, interest into dividends in order to qualify for a tax exemption and for underlying foreign tax credits paid in other jurisdictions. The opposition strongly supports this measure and we question whether the proposal is adequate given the magnitude of the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The explanatory memorandum lists the savings from these proposals at around $130 million per year, so presumably this rort has been costing Australian taxpayers that amount for some considerable period of time. Honourable members would be aware that, over the last few years, financial institutions&mdash;banks&mdash;have been reaping huge profits, have produced huge increases in their share value for their investors&mdash;we note that the National Australia Bank passed BHP, to the chagrin of BHP investors&mdash;and have massively increased the level of fees and charges levied on ordinary customers. We now find out that some of these financial institutions have apparently also been rorting the tax system to the tune of $130 million per year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This kind of blatant sham arrangement should be shut down and we will be supporting the passage of this bill. I also ask the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) to detail to the House what action the Taxation Office has taken in attempting to collect this tax for the period prior to 4 February this year. Has the issue been taken to the courts to see whether these schemes are legally bullet&hyphen;proof and, if so, what was the reaction of the courts? Wouldn't it in fact be the case that the general anti&hyphen;avoidance provisions of part 4A operate to strike down an arrangement which is merely converting income from one form to another for tax avoidance purposes? And if the anti&hyphen;avoidance provisions do not cover arrangements like these, doesn't this suggest that there is a need to review and possibly strengthen these anti&hyphen;avoidance provisions?</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8314">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our society functions on voluntary compliance with our taxation laws. Ordinary taxpayers pay their share because they acknowledge that this is the price of a decent society. Decent public services cost money and have to be paid for by taxpayers. They pay their fair share and they know that business is also supposed to pay its fair share. The schemes dealt with in this bill are examples where large businesses have not been paying their fair share. Those examples tend to undermine the vital system of voluntary compliance because people think, `Why should I pay tax when I'm struggling to make ends meet, if large transnational financial institutions can rort the system?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third area in the bill concerns the involvement of charities in tax avoidance. That has been occurring through tax exempt entities distributing funds offshore. The bill proposes that the existing exemption for foreign located charitable trusts be terminated; the exemption provided to charitable trusts established in Australia be restricted; the exemption be removed for certain organisations&mdash;for example, trade unions and religious, educational and other bodies&mdash;which do not operate principally in Australia; and the exemption for non&hyphen;resident interest, dividend and royalty withholding tax be also removed for certain organisations located offshore.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The mere thought of tax exempt bodies being used for tax avoidance is an unpleasant one. These are bodies which have, ostensibly, been set up for public benefit, be it a charity, a sporting organisation, an educational organisation, a trade union, an employer body, et cetera. In recognition of the important roles played by these bodies, this parliament has provided tax exemption to the income of these bodies to enable their important work to be undertaken without tax penalty. It is frankly despicable that some accountants or lawyers have abused this system to enable tax exempt bodies to be conduits, either knowingly or unknowingly, for tax avoidance. A rort is a rort and it has to be stamped out irrespective of the players involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All that said, when fixing a problem, it is incumbent upon the government to ensure that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> no damage is done to genuine tax exempt bodies in the process of sorting out the cheats. On this score, the government has failed miserably. Every member of the House probably received correspondence from alarmed groups, including religious groups, sporting groups and educational groups, after they saw the initial draft of the legislation earlier this year. That draft legislation proposed to penalise those groups who had virtually any offshore connection or activity. The proposed penalty was not minor or trivial but, rather, involved the loss of their income tax exemption. So, clearly, many legitimate bodies would have been significantly adversely affected by the original proposals of the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true that, because of the outcry over the original clumsy approach to addressing this issue, the government has backed down. However, there is some considerable doubt about the extent of the redrafted provision. In particular, the education and training industry is concerned about the possible effects of the redrafted legislation. For example, International Training Australia&mdash;ITA&mdash;has written to the opposition expressing its concerns about the bill before us. ITA is a private company with its shareholding comprised solely of Victorian government enterprises. It was established to combine and coordinate the training and education capabilities of the Victorian TAFE system in large&hyphen;scale overseas projects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">ITA is very concerned that the provisions in this bill will impact on its members' current drive to increase the export of Australian educational services. These Australian educational institutions, for commercial reasons, often have to establish foreign subsidiaries or Australian subsidiaries which do not operate principally in Australia. These bodies are not engaged in tax avoidance, but they may be caught by this legislation and, hence, lose their tax exempt status. Clearly, this would be a poor outcome for Australia as these bodies are in fact engaged in earning export income for Australia. There has already been a serious attack on public education by this government, and the opposition is very concerned by any legislation which 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8315"> would further inhibit the legitimate activities of the education sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some religious groups are also very concerned about the potential impact of this bill. For example, the Africa Evangelical Fellowship of Australasia sends missionaries to Africa and the islands of the Indian Ocean, where they are engaged in a wide range of religious, humanitarian and social programs to assist the peoples of the region. This group has been operating for more than 100 years providing vital assistance to underprivileged peoples. All of these issues need to be carefully considered in the Senate to ensure that these important groups are not unfairly penalised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Trustee Corporation of Australia is also concerned about the potential impact of the legislation from a different perspective: the impact on wills and on charitable bequests arising from wills. The TCA is concerned that the legislation may necessitate many trusts having to appear before the relevant state supreme courts in order to amend their terms to comply with the new regime. For example, amendments may be needed to expressly prohibit overseas distributions. This is a potentially complex and expensive process and may be more legally difficult than assumed by the government. Again, this is a serious issue that needs to be examined by the Senate to ensure that the correct balance is struck.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The general issue of trusts and tax avoidance is a very sensitive one for the government. There is now widespread knowledge in the community that considerable leakage of revenue from the tax system arises through the use of trusts. In a speech to CEDA on 10 September the Commissioner of Taxation, Mr Carmody, put the issue squarely in the court of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) when he addressed the issue of trusts and whether the current arrangements are appropriate. Mr Carmody made the point that, in some situations, trusts can allow the tax&hyphen;free receipt of profits by beneficiaries which would have been taxable if they had been earned by companies and then distributed to shareholders. As he said, how can such a situation be fair and promote the efficient conduct of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> businesses? Mr Carmody pointed out that the tax office is in a unique position, given the extensive powers that they necessarily exercise, to make judgments about some of these issues. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As trusts have increasingly become simply an alternative business structure we believe it is perfectly valid to raise for consideration what should be the appropriate treatment for tax purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both companies and trust structures can offer the advantages of limited liability and a capacity to split income (even more in the case of trusts). In these circumstances we think it is perfectly valid to raise for consideration the question `why should not the starting point for this be that companies and trusts be treated the same for tax purposes'. Thus, for example, we believe it is fair to ask why certain distributions from a business conducted through a trust are capable of being received free of tax while the same distributions made from a business conducted through a company are subject to tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, where a company pays a dividend out of profits which have been sheltered from tax because of, say, deductions for building allowances or accelerated depreciation, the dividend is taxable in the hands of the individual shareholder. A distribution in similar circumstances from a discretionary trust is free from tax.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Similarly, a distribution by a company from an asset revaluation reserve is treated as a taxable dividend whereas a similar distribution from a trust is generally not taxable.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He further mentioned reports of one particular high wealth individual receiving a tax&hyphen;free amount of $19 million in just one year. How can such a system be supported when part&hyphen;time workers earning just over $100 a week have to pay income tax? And why is the government so reluctant to address the issues associated with the use of trusts? Why are we still waiting for the government's final legislation dealing with trafficking in trust losses? Labor introduced legislation into the parliament in 1995 to deal with avoidance practices involving trust losses. The then opposition refused to pass these provisions and delayed the measures in a Senate committee until the election. Since then, we have had two budgets which both announced further relaxations of Labor's fair proposals, but we still are yet to see this legislation before the parliament.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8316">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason is, regrettably, obvious: the issue is too difficult because too many of those opposite have family trusts and hence have a conflict of interest in seeing the issues properly addressed. Mike Seccombe from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> reported on 4 July that, according to the official registers of interest, 13 of the government's 27 ministers had family trusts. There is a real problem for the Treasurer if he wants to improve the fairness of the tax system: half of his ministerial colleagues will resist measures to increase the amount of tax that would be properly paid on their family income. Yet the Commissioner of Taxation has clearly signalled the direction that he prefers&mdash;comparable taxation of both companies and trusts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The response of the government to the review of the tax treatment of trusts will be a key indicator of whether the Howard government will simply be a re&hyphen;run of the Fraser government, which let tax avoidance get completely out of control, culminating in the infamous bottom&hyphen;of&hyphen;the&hyphen;harbour scandals. Alternatively, this government can continue the outstanding efforts of the Hawke and Keating Labor governments which introduced equity into the Australian taxation system. The problems of tax avoidance are perennial. Once one loophole is closed, advisers move on to the next one, so governments can never relax in their task of keeping the tax system fair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, this morning's newspapers have reported that the Prime Minister Howard has ruled out a major crackdown on tax avoidance through the use of trusts, and quoted him giving certain assurances concerning these matters to the government party room. This is a matter of great concern, because it is pre&hyphen;empting a review which the government itself initiated into trusts and the taxation arrangements surrounding them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also appears to be an attack on Treasurer Costello, who has authorised this review. Indeed, according to the report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> today the Commissioner of Taxation, Mr Carmody, was believed to have checked with Mr Costello's office before delivering what the reporter described as `his contentious speech on trusts'. So we have the Treasurer 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> initiating the review, we have the Treasurer giving the Commissioner of Taxation the green light to raise these issues for public debate, and then we have the Prime Minister squashing him and saying, `Oh, no, we're not going to get into the area of taxation of trusts.' That is entirely a regrettable development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For some time now, commentators have suggested that the treatment of trusts&mdash;and family trusts in particular&mdash;as companies for taxation purposes may be one approach to discourage the use of trusts for income splitting and other tax minimisation practices. This was an approach considered in the draft white paper entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Reform of the Australian tax system</EMPHASIS>, prepared by the Treasury for the tax summit back in 1985:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This chapter has drawn attention to the increasing use of trusts to avoid the company tax arrangements and engage in income&hyphen;splitting practices. A possible approach to this problem could be to tax trusts and limited partnerships on the same basis as companies. In the case of family trusts such a step would also substantially eliminate one major mechanism for income&hyphen;splitting practices among family members. However, in view of the complexities involved in this area, further detailed study of this matter will be desirable, particularly in the light of changes to the classical system of company taxation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Later, in 1991, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, in its report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Follow the yellow brick road</EMPHASIS> , also recommended that there should be a system of taxing trusts and companies in a uniform manner. This report was issued after the introduction of the company imputation system. Recommendation 3 of this report stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that there should be a move towards a system of taxing trusts and corporations in a uniform manner, with tax payable on the trust's net income at the company rate of tax and credit given proportionately to beneficiaries for income tax paid.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Treasurer announced in his 1997&hyphen;98 budget speech that the government would issue a discussion paper later this year with a view to reviewing the taxation of trusts generally. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Budget measures 1997&hyphen;98</EMPHASIS>  states that this review became necessary as information gathered by the Australian Taxation 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8317"> Office High Wealth Individuals Task Force has identified the use of complex trust structures for tax avoidance or undue tax minimisation. It adds:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is concerned to ensure that the taxation provisions relating to trusts deal appropriately with the modern day usage of trusts and do not permit tax avoidance or undue tax minimisation. It will be necessary to review the taxation of trusts accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Indeed. The 1996&hyphen;97 budget provided additional funds in excess of $19 million to the Australian Taxation Office to establish this task force to improve the compliance of high wealth individuals, who it was claimed had with aggressive tax planning and minimisation arrangements put at risk revenue estimated at $800 million per year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The prevalence of this form of tax minimisation and the extent of revenue at risk was disclosed on 11 February last year by the then Treasurer, Ralph Willis, in a press release under the heading `Increasing the surplus and funding: Labor's election commitments'. Although $800 million per year was the estimated income from tightening up the tax minimisation schemes of high wealth individuals, the 1996 budget papers apparently gave up on a lot of this revenue. Thus, 1996&hyphen;97 Budget Paper No. 1 only provided for additional revenue of the order of $100 million in 1997&hyphen;98 from high wealth individuals, with no figure being put on the possible intake in 1998&hyphen;99 and the following year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is significant that the financial implications of the taxation of trusts in the 1997&hyphen;98 Budget Paper No. 2 do not indicate any additional revenue&mdash;not one dollar&mdash;from the activities of the High Wealth Individuals Task Force in the years 1997&hyphen;98 to 2000&hyphen;2001. It would appear that even the $100 million which the 1996&hyphen;97 budget papers anticipated would be realised in 1997&hyphen;98 from the investigation into high wealth individuals is in doubt. The Treasury and the Australian Taxation Office are clearly reluctant to publish an estimate of the revenue that the activities of the task force will generate in 1998&hyphen;99.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This reluctance may be attributed to the uncertainty as to the extent to which high wealth individuals with family trust structures 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> would be able to utilise losses under the concessions announced in the 1997&hyphen;98 budget. An additional factor contributing to this reluctance is probably the awareness that the long lead time between the initial announcement in February 1996 and the yet to be enacted measures to discourage such avoidance or minimisation practices may well have afforded high wealth individuals an opportunity to reorganise their affairs to avoid any likely changes in the law. In other words, if the government closes the stable door, it will be after the horse has bolted. Given the comments of the Prime Minister as reported this morning, there is a real question mark as to whether the government indeed intends to close the stable door at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we go back, the government had demonstrated that it was conscious that timely legislative action might be necessary even before the completion of the proposed review of taxation of trusts, to prevent the further erosion of the tax base by the use of trusts. Budget Paper No. 2 says that before the review the Treasury and the ATO will release a discussion paper. It concludes by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government reserves the right to take earlier legislative action to prevent tax minimisation or avoidance by the use of trusts.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We will see, won't we? In his 1997&hyphen;98 budget speech the Treasurer also said that the proposals in the exposure draft of February 1997 related to the treatment of trust losses would be modified so that they did not affect closely held family trusts utilising losses in the family group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we go back one year earlier, to the 1995&hyphen;96 budget of 9 May 1995, the former Labor government announced measures to restrict the transfer of ownership or control of trusts that had accumulated losses. These measures were intended to reduce the opportunity for tax minimisation or avoidance by taxpayers with high marginal rates of tax who might acquire such trusts and inject income from other sources with a view to utilising the losses and thereby reducing their marginal rate of tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 10 February 1997 the government released exposure draft legislation on trust loss measures. The budget measures of 1997&hyphen; 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8318"> 1998 provide the outlines of the modifications to the draft legislation on trust losses. In the 1997&hyphen;1998 budget speech the Treasurer stated that the government had changed the draft legislation and the legislation dealing with the use of trust losses would not now affect closely held family trusts utilising losses in the family group. The measures included the modification of three crucial definitions in the exposure draft: definition of `outsider', definition of `family member' and application of the definition of `benefit'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The exclusion of family groups from the trust loss provisions will probably reduce the additional revenue to be expected from these trust loss measures. It is significant that under the 1995&hyphen;1996 proposals the additional revenue in the first year was $90 million, rising to $185 million in the second year. However, under the 1997&hyphen;1998 proposals the additional revenue in the first year is a mere $5 million, rising to $15 million in the second year. So these changed definitions are likely to retain the attractiveness of trusts as a tax avoidance device, given the scope for income splitting and tax minimisation and the availability of trust losses to family groups. We will await the final bill in this area with great interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me also express concern about the fact that the Taxation Office is reducing its staff levels. We have seen evidence of some 50 positions in Melbourne and Sydney being shed. As a result, these 50 staff in the Australian Taxation Office are involuntarily being made redundant in Victoria and New South Wales. At the same time the Taxation Office is telling taxpayers that, due to limited resources, they cannot expect to have their amendments looked at for some time. It is worth noting that this includes taxpayers who, due to a Taxation Office error, have received a debit assessment instead of a refund as expected, and that in turn is due in part to the fact that they have staffed new processing centres with inexperienced temps at the expense of full&hyphen;time permanent staff. The level of the staff earmarked for redundancies is the same as those who will normally process these returns. While it is not clear where the sacked staff will come from, it is almost certain that some, for example, will 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> come from the Moonee Ponds office located in my electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sacking of those 50 staff means not only that people cannot get their returns in time but also that the Taxation Office does not have the resources that it needs in order to protect the country's revenue base. It is simply not good enough to say that the taxation base is being eroded so we need to look at a GST, we need tax reform, when the government is failing to make adequate preparation for protecting the revenue base and is getting rid of staff in the way that it is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude, as I began, by indicating that we do not oppose the measures which have been brought before the House, but we think that the government needs to do a lot more in the area of preventing tax avoidance and protecting the nation's revenue base.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">I also inform the House that I have asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) to act as Minister for Administrative Services and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and the Deputy Leader of the National Party (Mr Anderson) to act as Minister for Transport and Regional Development pending the appointment of new ministers to replace the two resigned ministers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also inform the House that the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr McGauran) has, in the normal course, repaid a significant sum of money, but in circumstances that did not involve any suggestion of an improper claim or a claim to which he was not entitled. I table for the information of the parliament a signed statement from the minister, which I fully accept, explaining the circumstances of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also inform the House that in relation to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott), as I think is already known, there was a repayment of $1,715. This related to three separate times: an amount of $860 on 3 March 1997; $685 on 26 May 1997; and $170 on 28 May 1997. The amounts repaid related to two inadvertent overnight claims&mdash;one on 21 April in relation to Norfolk Island and one on 29 July at Katoomba. The balance relates to the minister refunding 52 nights spouse entitlement&mdash;and I ask the House to listen carefully to this&mdash;on the basis that the minister did not believe he had incurred additional expenditure in relation to those particular nights, even though entitled to the payments, and 10 nights refund of the differential rate paid as a member rather than as a minister, even though entitled to the higher rate. In other words, Mr Scott has been absolutely meticulous in his honesty. Clearly, the greater part of Mr Scott's repayment need not have been repaid at all. I accept that and I think all honourable members ought to accept that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will take the opportunity of saying a few words. First of all, I would like to record my gratitude to the Minister for Transport and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Regional Development for the absolutely outstanding reforms that he has been responsible for over the last 18 months. Can I also say of him and also of the now resigned Minister for Administrative Services that, in all of my dealings with both men, I have never had any reason to doubt their personal honesty or probity. In appointing the inquiry that I have mentioned, not only have I acted swiftly and promptly and appropriately but also I make no judgments at all about the outcomes of those inquiries and I make no judgment about any views concerning their behaviour in relation to those events in terms of integrity and probity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have accepted their resignations and I believe that their resignations are appropriate because, firstly, given the magnitude of the adjustment that was made, it ought to have been disclosed at the time and, secondly, given the magnitude of the adjustment, there should have been a pursuit of a more detailed formal explanation for the reason for the discrepancy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I have done is in stark contrast with what was done on earlier occasions by those who sit opposite. So I hope we are spared the crowing hypocrisy that might otherwise be forthcoming. I have acted to uphold not only the reality of standards but also the perception of standards, and that is why what has happened has occurred. I repeat, Mr Speaker, that I make no judgment about the outcome of the inquiries. I should also inform the House that I was not informed of these matters when the adjustments were made in May of this year. Given the circumstances, that also was an oversight which should not have occurred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I again take the opportunity of saying that I have very much valued the contribution of my colleagues. I think it is regrettable that these events have occurred, but there was really no alternative. The public is not only entitled to the reality of honesty and probity but must also not be left in any doubt in relation to perceptions. I do not believe, on the information available to me at present, that either man has acted with any lack of probity or honesty. But I do believe, for the reasons that I have outlined, that their resignations were necessary.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8320">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In those resignations being provided and in my accepting them, I have upheld standards which have not been matched in this country for a very long period of time and which were certainly not the standards adopted by my predecessors, who were prepared to embrace the dying carcasses of condemned ministers rather than face the reality of the responsibilities that ministerial office brings and establish a proper inquiry. I again contrast what my government and my colleagues have been willing to do and the standards we have been willing to uphold compared with the miserable performance of our predecessors, particularly in relation to a former Labor senator from the state of Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I again thank my two colleagues. It is a regrettable day for them and for the government.

This is a good government, and it is led by two very good people: John Howard and Tim Fischer.

So I made my resignation available to the Prime Minister earlier this day.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thought I might take the opportunity to explain that I deny any impropriety in the way that this matter has occurred. Those who know the details of how these travel allowance claims have been made will know that at the first opportunity to correct them I did. I did so voluntarily. I informed within 24 hours of the corrections that were needed to be made. I offered to repay the money as soon as it was toted up for repayment. I make the point again, Mr Speaker, that this was a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> correction that was offered to every minister of the government and every former minister of the former Labor government. I took that opportunity. It was the first I had to make those corrections, and I did so voluntarily. I believe there was no impropriety. Indeed, I believe that, unless ministers are given the chance to correct their travelling allowance claims, the system does not work properly; and I took up that opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also take this opportunity to say that I am very proud to be a part of this government and, particularly, to have been Minister for Transport and Regional Development for the last 18 months. In my particular portfolio area, there have been a number of very significant and important reforms undertaken. The Prime Minister has, on occasion, referred to some of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to the reforms in our rail sector, only just recently we have seen for the first time in more than 100 years all Australia's states and territories agreeing to the establishment of one national rail system&mdash;the equivalent of one national rail highway system. We have seen for the very first time private sector rail operators come onto the system in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In aviation, we have made some very significant reforms as well. Sydney airport is one which the Prime Minister is very interested in, as I know a number of other members of parliament are also. When we came into office, Sydney airport and aircraft noise was a major problem for people living in Sydney. It is now much less so. Indeed, I believe the reforms there&mdash;the reopening of the east&hyphen;west runway and the new long&hyphen;term operating plan&mdash;have brought enormous relief and benefit to the people of Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to other reforms in aviation, there is the  privatisation of the Brisbane, Melbourne and Perth airports and the subsequent privatisation of the other 15 airports which I, in conjunction with the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey), have put on the market. I believe those will see enormous gain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In road transport and in the roads area, I know with respect to the Pacific Highway that a number of my colleagues in the National Party who represent the area up there and, of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8321"> course, others in southern Queensland will be enormously proud. I am enormously proud of the fact that, for the very first time, we are now putting funds&mdash;$3.1 billion in partnership with the two state governments&mdash;into upgrading the Pacific Highway. The black spots program, which is a terrific scheme that should never have been axed by the former government, will save 74 lives per annum, on the figures that we have accumulated. This year we will have the lowest road toll in more than 25 years. I think the black spots program and other works will help contribute to that lowest road toll in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In maritime, we have made a number of important changes. For the record, when ANL is privatised, you will not give it away; I can assure you of that. You will get a good value for it because in the last 18 months it has been reformed dramatically and is performing extremely well. We did away with the trans&hyphen;Tasman accord, and I think the road is now clear for major reforms on the waterfront. I am very proud of the shipping reform group's recommendations for reform of the shipping industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those are but some of the reforms that we have seen undertaken in Australia in the last 18 months in the transport area. I again thank the Prime Minister for the support that he has given me throughout this 18&hyphen;month period.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been a very great privilege to serve as a minister of the Howard government for the last 18 months. I suppose that the Department of Administrative Services is not one of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> those departments that gets much of a profile, but the reforms that have been undertaken in the last 18 months, in terms of the way government does business and in terms of our privatisation program, have been really quite remarkable. I would like to place on the record my thanks to my departmental officers and, in particular, to my personal staff, for giving me all that assistance during the last 18 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose it is rather ironic but, seeing that I am not going to get a question today, I would like to inform the House that the new accounting system for members' entitlements came into operation on 15 September. I believe that the reformation that we have undertaken in this regard is going to mean that all members of the Senate and the House of Representatives can be quite confident that the reporting system is going to be open and transparent. I hope the disease that has spread through both Houses over the last 12 months or so in terms of travel rorts will now be gone forever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The KPMG report indicated that the vast majority of members of parliament are honest. What has happened in the last 12 months is that the reputation of senators and members has been sullied, and that is the last thing I want to see happen to this institution.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Mr Speaker, firstly, all of us are human beings and all of us aspire in this place for opportunities to serve in the way in which the two resigned ministers have served. Therefore, all of us must feel for them humanly today in the circumstances in which they find themselves, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8322"> no matter how deserved we might think their situation. Nevertheless, you struggle very hard in politics to attain the positions that they attained and you must feel sorry for people who find themselves in that situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nevertheless, the operative point in my remarks is that these are resignations that were necessary, and the resignations of themselves do not answer questions. I hope the Auditor&hyphen;General will answer those questions, though there are some that, I would say almost immediately, lie outside his frame of reference and really do need to be considered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before going further on that, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) wrapped himself and his standards in the remarks that he made and made some gratuitous comments about us. Let us be absolutely clear on this: these events today would not be happening but for an article by Laurie Oakes. It is as simple as that. If Laurie Oakes had not put these matters before the Australian public, these events would not have been happening here. So let us take that as the first point of correction. This is not a self&hyphen;generated set of resignations. That is the first point that needs to be made about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Second, he chose to mention the situation of Senator Colston, who was permitted to pay resources back likewise in circumstances where there was no publicity. The actions taken at the time were the exact equivalent of actions taken by the previous government&mdash;that government immediately prior to ours&mdash;and was in total accordance with that. So some sort of notion that something special and unique was done back there is revealed as a nonsense by those facts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third point that can be made about those particular standards is this: whilst within a day of the public revelation and several days of the revelation to the Prime Minister these individual ministers have in fact been sacked, that is not the pattern of performance here. The Prime Minister referred to carcasses twisting slowly in the wind and not wanting to have carcasses twisting slowly in the wind. If he had been around at the end of the last parliamentary session instead of in the United Kingdom, he would have seen them swinging in a hurricane in that particular instance. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> There are still ministers in this government who should have gone on a normal set of standards and there are other ministers who took a long time a&hyphen;going, as in the case of the first resignation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What makes this Prime Minister unique in the experience of past prime ministers is that he has managed in the first 18 months of operation to have more than half a dozen cases where ministers should have gone and in fact six have gone in these circumstances. That is a high casualty rate by any set of standards, and it reflects the unique problems of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister reminds me so much of that old Russian story of the couple in a sleigh being pursued by wolves. They have a bag of apples on the back and, as the sleigh charges on, they throw an apple out every now and then to stop the wolves as they come after them. In this particular case the Prime Minister would have had the wolves coming for him because, on the advice to us&mdash;and this is something that can be cleared up in question time&mdash;he knew about these circumstances on Monday, was briefed on Monday as far as he was concerned, and yet managed on Tuesday, the day after it, to declare full confidence in his minister for transport. That immediately raises a substantial question for the Prime Minister to answer in due course. It was only when it was absolutely clear cut to him that he was going to be overrun that his `full confidence' changed to `I demand your immediate resignation.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we also have the terms of reference for the Auditor&hyphen;General. I suggest strongly to the Prime Minister that he look more broadly, at least in the case of Minister Sharp's pattern of travel claims. Minister Sharp's pattern of travel claims differs not one wit from the last two years when he happened to be a frontbencher. In fact, it was slightly lower. Last year there were 156 claims. A claim was submitted for every single parliamentary sitting night on a Thursday in Canberra and every single Sunday immediately prior to the parliamentary sitting beginning. If you are talking about patterns of behaviour in relation to this, then a pattern of behaviour has been established in that regard.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8323">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is once more covered in soil from its performance in this place. There have been six ministerial resignations in 18 months of existence and at least three or four other ministers who should have gone on misleading the House, misdeclarations of their pecuniary interests or conflict of interest. You have had a situation of truly gargantuan proportions when it comes to propriety here. Then there is the Prime Minister knowing full well that, were it not for the fact of Laurie Oakes's exposures, there would have been no resignations on this occasion either.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us be absolutely clear about all this unction in this place from the Prime Minister on his standards. If Laurie Oakes had not produced that report and given notice to the various ministers' officers that he was working on it, there would have been no resignations here today. I suppose Laurie can chalk that one up to himself, but the person who cannot chalk it up is the Prime Minister in the situation in which he finds himself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will conclude where I started off. As I say, all of us here, as well as politicians and partisans, are also human beings and we are saddened to see the circumstances in which other people find themselves, and certainly the circumstances in which the two ministers find themselves. I wish them well in their future careers, what remains of their parliamentary careers. I express our sorrow for them that they should have left on such a poor note.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to debate the fourth taxation amendment bill of this year. I wish to make reference to a few of the comments made by the member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson), who spoke previously on this topic. He seems to be very jealous of any high wealth individuals in this country. His mean&hyphen;spirited, money grubbing, small thinking, bullying tactics are more appropriate to a school yard than to a global economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He makes reference to a high wealth individual who in one year avoided $19 million in tax. I imagine that in that same year he would have paid at least $1 million in tax, which is certainly a lot more than any other individual I know is paying in tax. It reminds me of the position of Steffi Graf, who has been hounded by the German tax office for $2 million and is considering surrendering her German citizenship, given that over her tennis career she has paid $41 million in tax to the German economy. Numerous other individuals have given up their dedication to their nation and country in order to get out of avaricious, money grubbing tax regimes that do not encourage investment or a climate of wealth generation and do not encourage a nation of people to progress within a global economy and seek to further advance themselves by staying within the OECD nations rather than falling out the bottom.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member made reference to the NAB during his comments on thin capitalisation. In fact, the NAB is a financial institution and as such is not affected by the thin capitalisation provisions of this act. This legislation is really looking at allowable foreign debt and foreign equity gearing ratios for taxpayers who are not financial institutions, that is, anything but a bank. The banks still retain their 6:1 gearing ratios. That is obvious, given that by very definition they are in the business of lending money. Generally they have borrowed money in order to loan money and thereby make a profit. That is their business and they are exempt under this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other interesting amendment in this bill is the provision relating to electronic lodgment and electronic funds transfer. It allows the income tax law to provide for the electronic lodgment of tax returns. In fact, this is already a current administrative practice for tax agents right throughout Australia. It is very efficient and expedient and is also a comprehensive resource that is easily traced back to source. That sort of technology is throughout our society today and is something that we should be pursuing as a nation. We should be looking at reducing our administrative costs, our paper shuffling and the number 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8324"> of bureaucrats who stay in one position and transfer a pile of papers from one side of their desk to the other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These days it is up to the taxpayers, individuals and citizens of Australia to have greater electronic access to their government departments, to referenda and to a number of other issues that will be coming up in the future. It must be recognised that the electronic lodgment of tax returns is the way to go. It can be done far more accurately than being done by the human eye and it becomes simply a matter of operator error. It has enormous applications right throughout other government departments, not only Treasury. This sort of technology can be moved into the Department of Administrative Services and the Department of Social Security. We could end up with a situation, as is coming up in child care, where we have smartcards doing all the returns and the record keeping for everyone into the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The technology available in Australia, our initiative and our national wealth in the ability of people to come up with new ideas are things that should be encouraged by supportive tax regimes. These tax regimes should support investment and growth and encourage global multinationals to move cash to Australia and invest in Australia, our children, our future and our future electronic base. This is where the future of Australia lies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ireland has gone a long way with the structure of its tax regime in order to attract those sorts of industries. In that nation they have no withholding tax for information technologies. They have a 10 per cent tax regime guaranteed to the year 2010 and R&amp;D royalties are tax free. We should look at the year 2010. I want Australia to be in the top 10 in everything by the year 2010. That is where we must head. That is our children's future, but it will only occur under a tax regime that contains elements which are open, not to abuse, but to investors. People must be able to conduct their tax affairs under the legislation without suddenly having the mat pulled out from under them when Carmody and other bureaucrats run around wailing that people are avoiding millions of dollars in tax

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Menzies for his question. I think the House would be aware that a hearing took place on this matter in Saudi Arabia yesterday, 23 September. I have been advised by our embassy in Riyadh that the court confined its deliberations to a judgment involving a gaol term of eight years and 500 lashes for Lucille McLauchlin. The accused has two weeks to appeal against this judgment. No sentence has been handed down at this stage and it would be inappropriate to comment or speculate. Regarding Deborah Perry, no 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> judgment or sentence has been announced at this stage and therefore equally it would be inappropriate for me to pre&hyphen;empt outcomes from the Saudi judicial system. We understand there will be further hearings in Saudi Arabia on 17 October.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can inform the House that I have had a number of conversations recently with the British Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook. I met with Robin Cook during the time of the Princess of Wales's funeral when I was in London in early September and discussed this matter with him then and on other occasions. I have also discussed this matter on occasions with the British minister of state for foreign affairs responsible for the Asia&hyphen;Pacific, Derek Fatchette, and spoke to him most recently last week about it. I have also had discussions with the British High Commissioner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is, of course, a very difficult and sensitive issue. Our first priority has been that whoever it was who murdered an Australian citizen must be brought to justice. Secondly, Australia is a signatory to the second optional protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and therefore the Australian government does not support capital punishment. I have also met with Frank Gilford to discuss this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been significant progress in recent weeks but the issue is not yet resolved. Legal representatives of both parties have held discussions about a possible settlement, and I think that is a welcome and a positive development. The terms of any agreement, though, are a matter ultimately for both of the parties concerned. It would therefore be inappropriate for me to comment further on the possible terms of any settlement. I have played some role in helping to bring the parties together, and clearly the government would welcome any outcomes which would contribute to a settlement while also securing justice for the memory of Yvonne Gilford.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK></QWN>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You will recall that I answered a question in the House on a previous occasion when the question of double medalling arose. You may also recall that I made a subsequent statement that, because the government had listened to the call of the people, a medal would indeed be awarded.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very pleased to say today that what we will be awarding to those personnel who served in the Korean War, the Malayan Emergency and the Indonesian confrontation is an Active Australian Service Medal 1945&hyphen;1975. But, because we believe that those who served in Vietnam should have a similar, distinctively Australian medal, they will also be eligible for the AASM `45&hyphen;`75.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government considered it important that a clear distinction was kept between warlike and non&hyphen;warlike operations. Thus, the ASM medal is for non&hyphen;warlike duty and the AASM medal is for warlike duty. In principle approval for the new medal has been received from Her Majesty the Queen, and the formal process of instituting the manufacture of the medal and the ribbon has begun. I hope the initial batch of medals will be available for next Anzac Day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Eligibility for the AASM will be limited to personnel who received or have an entitlement to receive the Imperial Medal, the Korean medal for service in the Korean War from 1950 to 1953, a general service medal for service in either the Malayan Emergency 1948 to 1960, the Indonesian confrontation 1962 to 1966 or the Vietnam War. Eligibility will also be extended to those who have received the Vietnam Medal or the Vietnam Logistic and Support Medal. The precise eligibility of the AASM `45 to `75 for those recipients of the VLSM will be determined by myself in consultation, but will include current and former defence personnel and some civilian recipients of this medal. I am giving this detail, because the medal has been a matter of concern to many Australians, and I think the detail is deserved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I repeat the point about the Vietnam Medal. Bars to the Vietnam Medal will not be awarded to recognise multiple tours of duty, because we are now awarding the AASM to holders of the Vietnam Medal and those who qualify for the VLSM. The ban on people being eligible for the Vietnam Medal and the VLSM will be retained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those veterans who applied earlier for the medal and were advised that their application was not to be processed will have to apply again. Those who have forwarded their

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question and recognise that a lot of members in the House are very interested in this important regional security issue. It will not come as a surprise to the House to hear that the government supports the continuing vitality of the United States&hyphen;Japan alliance as a key factor in our regional security environment. We see the achievement of the new guidelines yesterday in New York as further enhancement of this important relationship, not least by encouraging a continuing regional defence commitment by the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8328"> United States. It does not change the fundamental framework of the United States&hyphen;Japan alliance, of course.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The revised defence guidelines clarify the United States&hyphen;Japan roles in a contingency. The guidelines now specify that Japan could be expected to undertake a range of tasks&mdash;such as search and rescue, enforcement of sanctions, non&hyphen;combatant evacuations and provision and maintenance of supplies of US forces, and so on&mdash;in international contingencies which threaten Japanese interests. But how it will apply in practice is a matter for the United States and Japan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia supports a broader role for Japan in the region while accepting that it should determine when, how and how fast it should go in enhancing this role and that this role should develop with sensitivity to the views of the wider region. In this context, we have welcomed Japan's efforts to be transparent with China and other regional countries about the review, a process in which we have appreciated being included.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude with one very important point. In supporting these revised guidelines, Australia is very strongly of the view that they should not be seen as part of a containment strategy aimed at China. They are certainly not that. I have made it clear that, as with our approach to China's growing economic influence, Australia's perspective on China's emerging strategic influence is an inclusive and a constructive one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prime Minister Hashimoto's recent successful visit to China and President Jiang Zemin's forthcoming visit to the United States demonstrate a strong and very welcome commitment by both the United States and Japan to cooperating with China in ensuring stability in the region.

Is the minister aware of media reports that South Pacific Cruise Lines planned to use nearly $3 million of taxpayers money to kick&hyphen;start a floating casino and hopes to use Norfolk Island as part of a tax scam? Has the minister sought a briefing on why South Pacific Cruise Lines moved nearly $400,000 of the government's training dollars to Norfolk Island?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. What does the national English survey reveal about the reading and writing skills of students from disadvantaged backgrounds and the impact of the 13 years of policies of the previous government? How will the government's literacy policies assist young Australians from battling families?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="8329" SPEAKER="Kemp, Dr David, MP" NAMEID="BT4" ELECTORATE="Goldstein" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs;Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BT4">Dr KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Bowman for her question and for her concern for the literacy standards of young people in her electorate. What gives such great importance to the government's drive for higher literacy standards is that literacy is absolutely fundamental to addressing effectively social disadvantage. One of the most disturbing findings of the recent national English literacy survey has been the very low literacy levels, the low reading and writing skills, amongst school children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, the fact that more children from this group fall below the national standard in year 5 than they do in year 3 and that the gap between these children and children from higher socioeconomic status backgrounds actually widens between year 3 and year 5.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nothing so clearly demonstrates the failure of the previous government to live up to its most central tenet according to its rhetoric of social justice than its failure in the literacy area. Over the last decade some $1 billion was poured by the previous government into disadvantaged schools programs, and there was no assessment whatever of the results of the expenditure of that money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This goes to the heart of the fact that the Labor Party has been unable to address a central issue of social disadvantage over the last 13 years. Its party meeting yesterday discussed literacy for half an hour and still was not able to come up with a policy. There is no leadership being given by the Leader of the Opposition on this matter. He came into parliament on a silver platter; it was just delivered to him. You could not expect him to understand the problems of battling families in this country.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BT4">Dr KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The thrust of the question is why Australia is facing this literacy problem at the present time. The reason is that the Labor Party has failed in its most fundamental obligation to the battling families of this country. John Cain advises in his biography&mdash;and the Leader of the Opposition would do well to listen to this&mdash;that in the area of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8330"> education we should have been firmer in our stand with the unions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem you face is this: the unions are only concerned in this area, as John Cain pointed out, with talking about class size and teacher salaries. They are never concerned with literacy standards; they are never concerned with effective policies to correct social disadvantage; they are never concerned with monitoring results in this area. It is time for the Leader of the Opposition to show some real leadership and develop a policy in this critical area, instead of doing what he has done in every other area: leave the Labor Party utterly directionless.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Deputy Prime Minister and it relates to agricultural tariff policy. Minister, you were recently quoted as suggesting that, if chicken meat imports are approved, the government will consider introducing a nine per cent protective tariff. Yet you have now taken away the tariff for the sugar industry a long way ahead of any trade or international obligation to do so. What are sugar growers expected to make of this? On the one hand you cannot remove protection for their industry fast enough, and on the other hand you are hoping that chicken growers will be conned into accepting imports by giving them a tariff. What sort of a trade policy are you running here?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am running a robust, comprehensive systematic trade policy which produced a record set of export figures last financial year of $104.4 billion. In case you missed that message, there was a surplus for the first time ever in both goods and services. In case you missed that message, we are now through the 20 per cent ratio of exports to GDP, and this is for the 12&hyphen;month financially period in which the Prime Minister, John Howard, and the coalition have been fully in power and seeking professionally, systematically extra market share.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very happy to answer the member's question. I feel sorry for him because he does not realise that, when you move from a total embargo on imports, there is a range of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> options well within our Uruguay Round bound commitments which the government has to consider and will consider at an  appropriate time as we work through the science in relation to chicken meat and other issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of sugar, I am underwhelmed by the moves of the United States last week in cutting back its quota. That came on the very day that the US Secretary of the Treasury, Mr Rubin, said that trade liberalisation was the right step forward and that countries involved in trade liberalisation will gain by that. On the one hand the US Secretary to the Treasury was preaching trade liberalisation, and on the other hand we had the US Secretary of Agriculture, Mr Glickman, winding back the quota on our exports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me conclude by saying why we are systematically getting on with the path of sensible trade market access expansion. I refer to the UAE, Slovenia, Singapore, New Zealand, Malaysia, Latvia, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Israel, Indonesia, Hong Kong and Brunei. Following various negotiations with those 12 countries over recent months, as well as previously, I am pleased to say that they have agreed to provide a zero tariff on Australia's exports of high quality sugar products into those countries. In other words, this has got to be seen as part of an overall equation. I will stand up for increased sugar market industry access to the world and expansion of their export efforts. I was in dialogue with industry leaders yesterday and we will further expand their markets at every opportunity.</PARA>

Despite the fact that on 6 March this year the shadow minister said `the board of inquiry report is being conducted in an open way and I commend the army', on at least three subsequent occasions he has, in my view and the view of others, quite improperly called for an intervention in the disciplinary procedures. In effect, he has advocated on three occasions an interference with some of those procedures, as I said. I have told the shadow minister before in this House that the convening authority cannot be directed as to how to exercise his authority by a superior officer or indeed by anyone else, and that includes the shadow minister.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure the honourable member for Moore would appreciate that the Income Tax Assessment Act is based upon payments being made within the appropriate time. Clearly, in the event that there is to be a delay in the payment by any taxpayer there is a penalty imposed, and it is appropriate that there be a penalty imposed as a deterrent.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HQ5">Mr FAHEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government has announced changes to the Commonwealth civilian employees superannuation schemes. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8332"> The details of those changes are that, as from 1 July 1998, new employees in the Commonwealth public sector will be able to put the employer's contribution into a complying superannuation scheme or retirement savings account of their choice. They will not be able to join the public sector superannuation scheme. As from that date that scheme will be closed to new members.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As from 1 July 2000, current Commonwealth employees can, if they choose, leave the Commonwealth superannuation scheme or the public sector superannuation scheme and can choose, if they wish, after ceasing membership to have future employer superannuation contributions paid to another complying superannuation fund or retirement savings account of their choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I stress that remuneration for current or future Commonwealth employees will not be reduced by these changes. Funding of the Commonwealth agencies for this purpose&mdash;for employer superannuation contributions&mdash;will not be affected. However, new employees or existing employees, if they choose, can in fact negotiate the level of the employer contribution with the employer, subject to the safety net of the superannuation guarantee rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These changes are consistent with the government's objective of facilitating greater choice in superannuation arrangements, as was announced by the Treasurer in the 1997-98 budget. The changes will provide individuals with flexibility, portability and choice to save for their retirement in a manner to suit their individual needs. I stress again that this is entirely consistent with the Prime Minister's pre-election commitment to the public sector, notwithstanding statements that have been made in the past 24 hours by the CPSU and the Labor Party.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4K4">Mr ANDERSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. One of the very serious problems faced by rural and remote communities is the lack of access to services which are very often taken for granted in urban areas. The rural communities program, announced as part of the AAA program recently, seeks to address the problems caused 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> by isolation and size but to do so in a way that is not prescriptive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rural communities program offers significant opportunities for people in rural areas to develop much needed community services. The RCP has three core areas of opportunity&mdash;community development, information and technology, and infrastructure and regional strategic planning. Services provided through the former rural communities access program and the rural partnership program are still available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps the best example of the kind of service that will be funded under the rural communities program is the highly successful credit care, which the government has continued to commit itself to. We have committed further money under this package to this program because some studies put together by the University of Southern Queensland show that when the last bank pulls out of a country town, there is a very real and significant impact on that local town&mdash;on its businesses, clubs, sporting activities and even its local fuel station and what have you. There are 33 country towns across Australia with credit care and another 30 waiting to access credit care facilities. Now they will even be able to issue cheques. We also fund those much needed rural financial counsellors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The RCP will also provide improved access to telecommunications technology and community development projects as well as professional assistance for community based regional strategic planning. This of course is new. These initiatives will build upon the successes of previous programs. Funding will still be directed towards rural communities but with added flexibility for the local community to define the sorts of services which will best service their needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Grey knows very well the big difference that these commitments can make in hard pressed rural communities of the sort that he represents. No doubt, this commitment to funding for community development initiatives under agriculture advancing Australia will be welcomed in your state, just as the package as a whole has been. I note with some interest that the member for Wakelin has brought to my attention that the main 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8334"> rural journal in that state, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Stock Journal</EMPHASIS>, has splashed across its front page this week that there should be thumbs up for the AAA package and goes on to say that rural South Australia welcomes the package. The editorial says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Prime Minister John Howard and . . . Primary Industries Minister John Anderson have delivered a package with real vision and hope.</PARA>

I refer to the study released yesterday by the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia which shows that 81 per cent of men and 64 per cent of women retire early, not because they choose to but because of circumstances beyond their control, such as their workplace closing down. The same study shows that well over half of the men retired with lump sum superannuation payments of less than $40,000, that very few had enough superannuation assets to support themselves until retirement age let alone for the duration of their retirement, and that most relied on social security payments as their primary source of income.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Quite fair and defensible. As you know, and as all of those who sit around you know, many of those measures were an extension of a measure that you had already introduced. If you are arguing that they are unfair, you are really condemning measures that were introduced by the government of your predecessor as the member for Blaxland. I cannot imagine that you would ever do that, would you?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I take the opportunity that the honourable member's question affords me to continue some of the things I was saying yesterday about the benefits of my government for retired Australians. I would like to remind you of the great savings initiative that is coming into operation in July next year. I remind you of the introduction of retirement savings accounts which provide more flexibility for people making their superannuation arrangements. I remind you of the extra choice that is being introduced to allow employees to access the superannuation fund of their choice. I remind you of the benefits that will accrue to many retired people in relation to providing under legislation, for the first time, that the pension should not fall below a fixed percentage of average earnings.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8335"> small and medium sized enterprises. Can you please inform the House what this survey reveals about employment trends in the all important small business sector?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="8335" SPEAKER="Reith, Peter, MP" NAMEID="WI4" ELECTORATE="Flinders" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Workplace Relations and Small Business" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think this is a very important question because it does go to a survey which has been released this week through the ABS and which has been funded through the Office of Small Business within my department. It is one of a number of these longitudinal studies. It involves 6,000 business units, 3,000 of which are small businesses. It is part of our survey generally in the small business community so that as we are better informed we can go on producing good policies for small business, as we have been doing since last March.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the latest results show very starkly is that small businesses, firms with less than 20 employees, are the driving force for the net increase of jobs measured by the survey and they accounted for 65 per cent of the jobs, which shows you what a tremendously vibrant and great section of the Australian community are the small businesses which were the subject of this survey. The survey also reveals that micro businesses, those with less than five employees, accounted for 57 per cent of the total net employment change. That, again, re-emphasises the importance of small business for growth of jobs in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All that also makes the point that we really need, as a parliament, to be giving real encouragement to the small business community. That is why the proposal, for example, to provide all small businesses with employees of 15 or less an exemption from the unfair dismissal law is a good idea, and it ought to be passed. The Labor Party, which was so ruinous for small business in 13 years, has the gall today in opposition to be still anti-small business and to be still opposing a proposal which would be to their benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So whether it is fiscal policy and getting benefits to small business through interest rates or whether it is doing the right thing to create jobs it is opposed by the opposition. But I can assure the House that this government is pro small business and, on this and other issues, we are determined to have a fair go for small business.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The announcement yesterday of the proposed establishment of a Human Rights and Responsibilities Commission demonstrates the government's commitment to human rights, and it is a commitment to effective and equitable protection of human rights and the promotion of them. We are introducing balance and equity where it has not always been.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to the responses to the announcement, they have been very positive. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission itself welcomed the announcement, and it specifically stated that the approach taken to the membership of the commission by the government was a positive one. The Council for Equal Opportunity in Employment also welcomed the government's decision. That council informed my office that it considered the introduction of a broader focus for the commission and a greater emphasis on the responsibilities which accompany rights will be a positive assistance to society in general.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Support also came from the Law Council of Australia. The new president of the council, Mr Brett Walker SC, highlighted that the previous administrative structure was not the best one for handling human rights issues. In welcoming the government's decision, the Law Council described the position as sensible and one which the council favoured.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Interestingly, there is one organisation whose response is out of step with those I have mentioned. It is a response which is as

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Fisher for his question and his legal interpretation of whether or not it was in order. I certainly believe it was. This is indeed a very important matter. It is very pleasing for this government to be able to report that we now have one of the most open and competitive telecommunications regimes in the world. Even in the United States and the United Kingdom they have greater restrictions than we do. For example, the US `Baby Bells' have to pass a 15-point test before they can enter into the long distance market.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can give about five examples of changes and new operators. AAPT, for example, announced that they would offer up to 60 per cent off the current cost of national and international long distance calls. Primus Globe&hyphen;Talk have reduced all international charges. They have dropped the rate to Germany by 40c per minute. With Northgate Communications, the cost from Ballarat to Melbourne for an untimed call is now 75c as a flat rate. World Exchange is operating a flat rate of 39c a minute for calls to the United States and the United Kingdom, and 38c a minute to New Zealand. Telstra is now fighting back&mdash;this is the product of the decisions that the government has made in this parliament&mdash;with a tariff plan under which by paying a higher up-front line rental charge customers can now get local calls for as little as 18c per household.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are new pricing regimes such as Telstra's Smartsaver flexiplan, at 23.2c per minute, with a 12c connection fee. Optus are matching it in the market with a 26.7c a minute fee. These are the types of pricing structures that the member for Fisher should be taking back to his electorate and telling 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> them that this is the product of competition that is growing as a result of the decisions of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason for this happening is that the price reductions are founded on a concept known as interconnection. The ACCC's new interconnection rates&mdash;and this is the centrepiece of telecommunications; this is as a result of the decisions we made on 1 July&mdash;see that the interconnection price for Telstra's national access service has dropped by around 35 per cent. This has led to new, tangible benefits that have flowed through the act to consumers. So change is all about in this industry. You have even seen Victoria's privatised United Energy become a licensed carrier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen innovative technologies engaged by new operators. OMNIconnect, for example, is looking at wireless network systems to provide savings of up to 30 per cent for  existing users. There have been innovative services introduced into the market. Things we have not seen before in Australia have emerged in the last 18 months. TechniCall Australia, a new entrant into the payphone market, aims to establish a network of 20,000-odd smart payphones capable of advanced functions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are other examples I could quote, but the fundamental point is this: because of competition, because of the decisions made by this government, endorsed by both houses of this parliament finally, greater competition has been created. We have a whole new range of licensed providers&mdash;about 12 now, I think, are licensed. The benefits have flowed to consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The major decision that was made yesterday by my colleague Senator Alston, the Minster for Communications, was groundbreaking, and it is fundamentally important to telecommunications&mdash;number portability. What number portability means is that now you can take your telephone number with you to another carrier. That has not happened before in this country. With number portability you underpin the changes in services, the changes in technology, and you capture for consumers that huge benefit. By doing what Senator Alston did yesterday we enhanced even 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8338"> further the decisions we made on 1 July. We have enhanced the opportunities for consumers. We are leading the way in this nation in competitive telecommunications services. We made a promise and we kept it.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

Each must recognise the different role of the other and must respect that role. I think we need to establish some clear ground rules because there is a lack of understanding on the part of some members of the executive, on the part of some members of the parliament and on the part of some members of the judiciary.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Howard government has just delivered another slap in the face to older Australians. The social security measures which started last Saturday are going to see older Australians who lose their jobs through no fault of their own being forced to retire and dip into their superannuation long before they are ready to as a result of this government's changes. This measure is on top of appalling changes that have already gone through this parliament as a result of this government's attitude to the aged.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen the introduction of two new fees for older Australians who want and need to go into nursing homes. From 1 October, nursing homes will require each and every older Australian who needs a nursing home bed to pay an up&hyphen;front entry fee if they have any assets&mdash;and that includes their family home. This will mean that older Australians will have to sell their family homes. It will be interesting to see whether the speakers opposite repeat the promise that has been made in this parliament by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) that people will not have to sell their homes. There is a realisation now out in the community and out in the nursing homes that people will have to sell their homes to get a nursing home bed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I discuss this issue with older Australians around the country, I ask them: `Have you got $80,000 to $100,000 tucked away in your back pocket to pay an entry fee to get into a nursing home?' Every Australian I talk to says, `No. The only place I have that sort of money is in my family home.' They know that they will have to sell their family home before they can get a nursing home bed.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8341">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a decision that will have to be made when an older person is in total crisis. It will have to be made when the older person is, in most cases, very ill and lying in a hospital bed. Their family will have to come to terms with the fact that their mother, father or relative has to go into a nursing home. You can just imagine the scenario: the nursing home owner will be saying, `It is $100,000 to get a nursing home bed.' The family will be saying, `The only way we can pay that is to sell the home, and we cannot do that immediately. How are we going to ensure that our relative gets the bed they need?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is becoming clear, particularly to members of the medical profession, that people are going to bank up in our hospitals while these very unfair negotiations take place. `Negotiation' is the word the government likes to use. The government thinks it is a negotiation between equals&mdash;between the nursing home owner and the person who needs the nursing home bed. Nothing could be further from the truth. The fact is that there is a limited number of nursing home beds. The person who needs to get a bed is desperate, as are their families. They will do whatever is necessary to get that person a nursing home bed, including selling the family home, which is what will be required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second measure that is being introduced&mdash;I understand it has now been delayed until 1 November because of this government's incompetence in getting anything done in time&mdash;is that from 1 November people currently residing in nursing homes and those who need to go into them in the future will have to pay an extra daily fee of 25c for every dollar the older person might earn outside the pension free area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When talking about this to a group of pensioners last week, one of them piped up very quickly, `Oh, this is another 25 per cent tax.' And that is exactly what it is. But, in the usual way of this government, do you think they have been up&hyphen;front and made it clear to older Australians that they are imposing another 25 per cent tax on them when they need to use a nursing home bed? No. They are saying to nursing homes: `You collect the tax on the government's behalf. Don't give 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the money back to the government, notify us how much you have collected and we will deduct that from the government subsidy you get.' How devious can this government be in taking money out of people's pockets?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These appalling changes to aged care, which are going to see the development of a two&hyphen;tiered system of nursing home care in this country for the first time in many years, are to be deplored. It will be the case&mdash;nobody should be so naive as to think it will not be&mdash;that those who can pay $100,000, even if it does require the sale of their family home, will get the best nursing home care. Those who have, say, only $20,000, let alone those who have nothing to spend, will have to wait at the back of the queue and get second rate care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other measures that I wanted to touch on here today that go to the heart of this government's attitude to older Australians are the changes that came in last Saturday. The first measure will require that superannuation assets be taken into account in the social security means test for people who are aged over 55. It will mean that more than 60,000 Australians will have their social security payments reduced or cancelled. That is happening as we speak. People are being told around this country: `You have a little bit of money put away for your retirement. Bad luck for you.' The government is going to get into your pocket and say, in a very short&hyphen;term way: `We are going to make you use that money now, when you are not ready for retirement.' By the time they reach the age of 65, it is likely that most of those people will have had to use up their superannuation and, of course, will then be dependent on the pension. If ever there was an example of short&hyphen;term policy making, this is it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister is shifting the goalposts for older workers who have done the right thing and invested in  superannuation for their retirement. Thousands of Australians have lost their jobs and, because of this government's complete ineptitude in dealing with unemployment, are finding it very difficult to get another job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This measure will force these older workers to draw on their superannuation nest egg long 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8342"> before they are ready to retire. Most older workers do not want to retire; they cannot afford to retire. They want to be able to keep working and contributing to their superannuation so that, by the time they do get to 65, they can afford to retire in a little more comfort than they otherwise might have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two other measures that started on 20 September which will mean that another 103,000 older workers&mdash;people who have lost their jobs&mdash;will have to wait a lot longer to get access to social security payments, to get any support from the rest of us. What those two measures say is that if you lose your job&mdash;if you are made redundant through no fault of your own&mdash;and you have any accumulated annual leave, long service leave or sick leave as part of your redundancy package then you will have to work out those leave entitlements before you get any help from social security. So if you thought that at the age of 50 or 55 you could put some of this redundancy package into paying off your mortgage, into getting the roof fixed and into making sure that things were done around the house so that you could live in reasonable comfort on your social security benefits, forget it. Basically you have to work out your leave entitlements and you will not get any support from this government as far as social security payments are concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other related issue is that not only will you get no social security support but also you will get no help in getting a job because if you are not said to be unemployed you will not be able to go down to the employment service&mdash;even the new privatised employment service. You will not be entitled to any support from employment services let alone any labour market training or retraining programs, which have been totally abolished by this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are very cruel measures, harsh measures that discriminate against older workers. It shows that this government has no concern about helping older Australians&mdash;older workers&mdash;get back into the work force. What this government is saying to older workers is, `We just want you off the unemployment queues. We do not want you to be counted. We want you to eat into your superannuation and use 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> up your annual leave entitlements.' This is a very short&hyphen;term measure because these people are going to end up on the old age pension, whereas they would have preferred to have been able to provide for themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to give examples of two people whom this affects. One is a man who is 56. He was made redundant 12 months ago. He has spent the last 10 of those months on Newstart while he looks for work. But from 20 September his payment was cancelled because, for the first time, his superannuation payout will count under the social security means test as he is over the threshold for single home owners. With no income from social security he must, to survive, draw on his superannuation, even though he really wanted to continue working until he was 65. The other example is of a woman who is 54 and is about to be laid off after nine years of working. Her redundancy package is worth $25,000, including $12,000 in superannuation, 12 weeks of cashed out annual and long service leave worth $5,000, and severance pay of about $8,000. Under the new rules she will have to wait three months before she gets any Newstart allowance. She will have to eat into the $13,000 that she was otherwise going to put into a deposit for her retirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These measures show clearly that this is a very short&hyphen;term measure. It is saying to older Australians, `You use up all your cash. It does not matter if it means in 10 years time you will have to go on the old age pension. We want to get hold of your money right now and we are going to make you use these funds. We are not going to help you back into the work force.' These measures, on top of the changes to aged care, show that this government has no concern for the aged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No doubt we will hear from those opposite that they are doing a wonderful job at introducing legislation to tie the pension to 25 per cent of male average weekly earnings. Let us just look at a little bit of history about this issue. When the government first came in, the National Commission of Audit said that the pension should be aligned with average weekly earnings, which would have seen the pension go down. Under pressure from Labor, this government has introduced legislation to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8343"> try and ensure in the future that pensions are tied to 25 per cent of male average weekly earnings&mdash;the higher level.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was Labor that made sure that pensions were 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. With the method that is going to be used by this government under the legislation that is still before the Senate we will see that pensions never meet 25 per cent of average weekly earnings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recommend to all of those who are interjecting opposite that they go and ask the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) whether or not it is the case that pensions under her system will ever meet 25 per cent of male average weekly earnings. They will not. So not only will people's superannuation be used up but also they will never, under this government's mechanism, get a pension equalling 25 per cent of male average weekly earnings. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, there is a record which Labor can have absolutely no pride in whatsoever. Labor did commission the Gregory report to look into nursing home and accommodation for older Australians&mdash;for the 10 per cent who end up in institutions. It did look at those, and what did we find? I recall that it was Mr McMullan, the member for 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Canberra, who actually called Professor Gregory `that eminent Australian economist'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Professor Gregory found that the nursing home stock was of such low standard that people with walking frames could not get into toilets, that there were up to five or six in one room, and that the rooms were substandard. But, while this highly regulated industry was in actual fact providing the most basic of care, there were no improvements available because of financial arrangements which were in place. Government funding was kept down. No arrangements whatsoever could be made to improve that stock.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At exactly the same time, the managements of hostel accommodation, which was largely run by the not&hyphen;for&hyphen;profit sector&mdash;in fact, 95 per cent run by the not&hyphen;for&hyphen;profit sector&mdash;were charging, whether you like to call it a bond or an up&hyphen;front fee, and managing it very well so that there could be some choice. People who had left their own homes had been enjoying a standard of living all their lives which they had worked hard to achieve. Now they could enjoy a standard of living which was not too different from what they had had and could have some enjoyment in their last months or years of life. But in nursing homes those standards were being kept right down. They were not being adequately funded, and there was no provision at all for any choice: whether a higher or better standard could be purchased.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is a very reformist government. It is not just saying it would be easy to sweep these things under the carpet. It is not just saying it might be politically sensitive to not give it attention. It is giving it attention. There are massive reforms. These reforms are not easy but, with an ageing population, we are not facing up to our responsibilities if we are not taking these issues absolutely head&hyphen;on.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8344">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will not demand that it is absolutely necessary and essential for the family home to be sold. That guarantee has been given by the minister in this place on a number of occasions before, every time the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) gets up to try to frighten elderly Australians. There was no requirement in the first six months that there be any up&hyphen;front bond or any bond payable. It is then up to negotiation. For instance, if the real estate market is down, if the family decide that it might be appropriate to manage their business in various ways, then they can do that. There will be moneys required.</PARA>

And it is not government money. I so often hear, `What is the government going to do about this? Will the government put some money into that?' It is not government money; it is taxpayers' money. Elected governments have a responsibility to ensure that taxpayers' funds are managed wisely and managed well, that any services which are in place are administered in such a way that our nursing home stock will be sustainable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The instruments which will be in place will mean that there will be a change from people saying, `There is a hostel here, there is a nursing home here, and, by the way, if your health deteriorates you will have to leave the hostel to go to the nursing home.' You might be leaving staff, friends and other residents that you are well acquainted with or in some circumstances a life partner. Under Labor, there is no way that care could be delivered in that hostel. So there was a change of great disruptive capacity impacting on those older Australians' lives&mdash;off to the nursing home.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the first 18 months of the coalition government we have set about the reforms that will be necessary for planning for an ageing Australia. It is not just those who are in nursing homes&mdash;although they are very important and deserve plenty of attention and the best possible planning and the best possible reforms&mdash;that we are thinking about. If 10 per cent spend their last few months in an institution&mdash;or their last few days or weeks&mdash;there are plenty of others who do not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are looking at ways of reforming the way that home and community care is delivered. The carers have had assistance which they never received under the previous government, and they have been very grateful for it. The domiciliary nursing care benefit has had an increase of 28 per cent. Fifty&hyphen;two carer resource centres are in the process of being opened around the country, and I was fortunate to have the privilege to open one in Adelaide within the last fortnight.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8346">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People who are involved with delivery of aged care and caring for older Australians&mdash;at whatever level and in whatever setting&mdash;appreciate what the needs are and what needs to be done about it. In the past and under Labor&mdash;and I was a member of that inquiry into the home and community care program&mdash;the difficulty that people who needed care had in accessing that system was enormous. It was such an uncoordinated arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was a two&hyphen;pronged problem. If there were services available, there was no way that people knew how to access them. In many instances there were no services available. So we need to be looking at the whole picture. We cannot be just concerned about 10 per cent here or another 5 per cent there. We must take a whole of government approach. We must be very much in vogue and we must be looking at the reforms necessary, and I am very confident that this is the way this government is going.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been suggested to me that the member for Jagajaga may be playing to the gallery. As I have said earlier, what we are doing for older Australians is far too important to degrade it. It is far too important to misrepresent what is being done. The worst offence of the lot is to pretend that nothing needs to be done, after being in opposition for only 18 months and after being in government for 13 years, after having commissioned the Gregory report but never having taken any notice of it, after not having attempted the reforms that were necessary. That is a far greater abrogation of responsibility towards our ageing population. At least this government is doing something about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) has been introducing a lot of reforms in this area, and it has been a difficult procedural process, but I think those who are providing care need our support. We need to be looking at the big picture. We recognise that it is complex. We recognise that there are different ways of providing that care, but it is not to be run away from and not to be swept under the carpet. We are taking on those responsibilities in different ways. I remind the House of the recent rural package which was

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today has been a fairly shameful day for the Howard government. In fact, if one looks back, it has been a very shameful 18 months for the people of Australia. I am very proud to second the matter of public importance which has been brought forward by the shadow minister for social security and member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), but I would remind the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Family Services, the member for Adelaide, (Ms Worth)&mdash;and I will read out the text of the member for Jagajaga's motion for her, in case she has not read it:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that the government's changes to social security and care for the aged, which will disadvantage our older Australians&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that it has a number of parts in it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would certainly like to touch on a number of things that possibly have been touched on previously. I would like to say to the member for Adelaide that, when she is talking about nursing homes and hostels, let us make it very clear&mdash;as we did in the debate time and again&mdash;there is quite a difference between hostels and nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In hostels you are aged but you have a choice. You make that choice to go into that hostel. A nursing home is when it is prescribed for you because you are no longer able to look after yourself. You could be either a person with dementia or a single person with no family who has suffered a stroke which has made you unable to care for yourself. Yet these are the people who are now going to be charged up-front fees if they wish to have the advantage of a bed in a nursing home, as limited as those beds are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No matter what the member tries to tell us in this House, one of the things that Bob 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8347"> Gregory did not say in that report is that you should charge older people in the last years of their lives to go into nursing homes. What you should be saying is that this Howard government in the last 12 months has taken $500 million out of aged care. What you should be saying is that in the last two years $820 million has been taken out of child care by this Howard government. If we are going to have debates in this House, we want to have factual debates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Aged Care Bill was brought in here as the prime bill to look after aged people in the future. Read the bill. There is nothing in it that gives any guarantee of what the up-front fees will be. It had to be in the regulations. We had a bill before this House with no prudential cover for those people who now are going to have to commit their savings to get a bed in a nursing home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now we have some organisation being put together by the minister&mdash;at a late date. Already, nursing homes being run by the churches or other non-profit institutions are objecting to what they are going to be obligated to do. How many exclusions will there be for that? Probably the Moran group will be the next one to be excluded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another area I would like to touch on which this matter of public importance covers. The Howard government is not only content with slugging our older people with drug taxes, increased fees on prescriptions and up&hyphen;front fees for nursing homes and with destroying our community based child&hyphen;care system; it also wants to go ahead with changes which are spreading unfairness and destroying equity across all strata of Australian society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This Howard government's juggernaut of mean&hyphen;spiritedness and selfishness continues to roll on and on in the shape of the social security changes that have now come into effect as of Monday this week. It really is not making life hard; it is just making it impossible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We now have a government which wants to punish people over 55 years of age who have been made redundant from their jobs. We have a government which wants to punish those older Australians who have contributed 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to this country for perhaps 40 years of their working lives. These people have paid their taxes up front and really have never asked for anything in return. These people have supported the welfare safety net with their taxes and their efforts throughout their working lives. Now they need just that little bit of support in return. But what is happening? This government is pulling the rug from under their feet and saying, `Forget it, buster. You're on your own. Get nicked!' I apologise; I refrain from that remark. Sorry, Mr Deputy Speaker. It was the temperament of the moment.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="MARTIN" NAMEID="8I4">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7T4">Mrs CROSIO</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They do say that in Western Sydney. There seems to be a continuing theme of the Howard government when it comes to the unemployed. Rather than saying, `Unemployment is a cancer in this country and we must work harder at defeating it by increasing employment,' this Howard government is constantly saying to those people, `You're unemployed; you cannot get a job. Too bad for you. But, don't forget, we are going to punish you for it.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not talking about cardboard cut&hyphen;outs. These are not statistics or numbers on a piece of paper. We are talking about human beings who have now been made redundant, human beings, 50 years of age and over, who have contributed so much to our society and who are now going to be made scapegoats by this Howard government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As our shadow minister has stated and pointed out, the government's latest changes to social security for those people over 55 now not only make life difficult for them but make it impossible. If you are over 55 now and have been receiving social security payments for nine months and have any superannuation or rollover assets that you have put aside for the older days, forget it&mdash;under the social security means test, that is now counted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for deemed income from any small financial asset you may have had&mdash;including your bank, building society, credit union account or cash or term deposit; that little bit of money you have been able to scrimp and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8348"> save and put away for that rainy day&mdash;forget it. It is now being included under your income tax. Depending on the total value of the financial assets of these people, it is now going to reduce or cancel out completely any unemployment benefit or social security payment you happen to receive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the new income maintenance test, people will not qualify for any social security payment for the duration of any cashed&hyphen;out annual leave, sick leave, long service leave or maternity leave included in their redundancy package. On top of that, there is no limit on the period of time they might be precluded from payment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the new liquid assets test, people will have to wait for up to 13 weeks before they can qualify for social security payments if they have liquid assets in excess of $5,000 for a couple or a miserable $2,500 for a single person. We just had an ex&hyphen;minister pay back $8,970, yet these people cannot get any help if they have that as a single person.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might add that liquid assets include the limited cash on hand they may have or any long-term deposits or, if they are lucky enough, shares which have been left to them by their father or grandfather. Getting assistance from the CES is just going to be impossible now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a government&mdash;perhaps you may not agree with me, Mr Deputy Speaker, when I use the words `hypocrite' and `fraud'&mdash;made up, I believe, of hypocrites and frauds of the highest order. On one hand they front up to our TV cameras and radio stations of this nation and bleat across the airwaves about how sorry they really are about the high levels of unemployment, particularly for older Australians. `It really is a terrible shame,' they tell us continually. They lecture and harry Australians about the importance of superannuation for the future of this country. They stare down from their great heights and lecture Australians about improving our levels of saving. They wring their hands, they mop their brows and they offer all this public sympathy&mdash;until they get behind their closed doors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I tell the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and his government: you do not kick a man when 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> he is down. But that is what this government is doing. It prides itself on doing it continually behind those closed doors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us go back to these changes. The member for Jagajaga gave examples, and I also would like to give you some genuine examples from my electorate and cases that I am having to deal with as of this week. A man in my electorate came into my office this week. He lost his job nearly 12 months ago from a manufacturing company in western Sydney. He is 57 years of age&mdash;I might add a very youthful 57; he still has a young family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He has been looking for a job for 10 months now. He has suffered all of the indignities of depression of the long-term unemployed, but he has not lost heart. He said to me yesterday that he was hopeful, as are many of those long-term job hunters out there. He is on Newstart. He knows that at least there is a safety net beneath him to keep him steady, that is, until last Saturday&mdash;it has gone now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bitter, ironic part of this is that this particular gentleman has now fallen victim to the economic and employment malaise that was orchestrated by this government. He lost his manufacturing job during the economic downtown arranged by this government upon taking power. But taking his job was not enough. It does not finish there. They will not let it end until they have wrung every last drop of dignity and self&hyphen;respect from his pores. He has suffered enough, but they have now told him, `Forget it; you are getting no more.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have another woman who came to my office this week. She has been employed in the same job for 12 years, and she is now going to have to wait three months until she can receive newstart allowance. She received a redundancy package. So do not get fooled when you receive a lovely golden handshake in the form of a redundancy package. Her redundancy package was roughly $30,000; a lump sum she had never had before. Under the government's changes, she is now being penalised for losing her job. She has been penalised for her loyalty to that one particular firm for being able to accumulate that long 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8349"> service leave and severance pay which make up a great deal of her package. These two individuals and thousands of other Australians like them are being hounded mercilessly by this government at a time when they had come to believe that the government was actually there to look after them when they needed help.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prime Minister Howard came to power promising not to touch the welfare safety net which Labor had so proudly put together to protect Australians in their time of need. Australians trusted him. They are the battlers who voted for him. They bought the whole performance. Now that trust has been betrayed, and for thousands of mature age unemployed workers across this country the Howard government has shown itself to be uninterested in their welfare, uninterested in their financial status and uninterested in their future. My only satisfaction is that, come the next election, those same people will show a distinct lack of interest in the future of this Prime Minister and this government at the ballot box. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What Australia does not need is more of what we have just heard. The issues that we face in Australia, particularly with the changing demographics of our country, are such that they will change the economic, the social and the political priorities of our country. It is about time that more of the solutions that this country needs were the product of more cooperation between both sides of parliament, rather than engaging in invective and ideological posturing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I go any further, a couple of things have been said by the previous two speakers which are not true. The first is that this government for the first time has guaranteed that the pension will be a minimum of 25 per cent of male average ordinary time weekly earnings. The member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) said that she doubted that the level of the pension would ever get to that. In fact, on the day that the bill was passed, the level of the pension was currently $9 a week more than 25 per cent of male average weekly earnings. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point made was one of the more substantive points made by the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio). She said that Professor Gregory did not recommend some contribution of a personal nature by people going into residential aged care. In fact, Professor Gregory identified that, in 1994, 87&half; per cent of people who were living in residential care institutions had a total income in excess of $238 million a year. That was the basis, amongst other things, for his recommendation that those people ought to be required to make some contribution to the care which they ultimately receive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In prefacing my further remarks about what the government is doing and is trying to do for older Australians, despite opposition from the other side, I would like to remind the House that our population is ageing. At the moment about 13.3 per cent of us are over the age of 65. By halfway through the next century it is thought about one-third of us will be over the age of 65. In the absence of a cure, eight per cent of us over the age of 75 will suffer from dementia and around five per cent of us will eventually need residential aged care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those who have not read it, Professor Bob Officer's National Commission of Audit report released last year had many things in it. One of them was that it is estimated that over the next 40 years we will need to spend 10 per cent more of our gross domestic product on the health and welfare costs of ageing above and beyond real growth from where we are currently at in order to care for us, and I guess people in my generation, when we are going to need it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1992 there were 5.3 Australians between the ages of 15 and 64 for every person under the age of 15 or over the age of 64. It is called an age dependency ratio. Officer estimated that over the next 40 years that ratio will go to 2.6 to one. If you further consider the situation we found ourselves in when we came to government, the Australian Bureau of Statistics identified last year that around 7.8 million Australians worked and paid taxes to support 6.2 million Australians, most of whom, through no fault of their own, were relying on some form of social security 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8350"> benefit. Some 1.2 million of that 6.2 million are dependants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point I am trying to make is that, unless we change the way we go about creating wealth in Australia, which is then distributed to those who are in need, and unless we restructure the way in which we finance essential services, particularly for older Australians, then frankly we have no hope and we are, as the parliamentary secretary reminded us, abrogating our responsibilities to the next generation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we took over government, we had had 20 years of an average government budget deficit of 1.4 per cent of GDP; a deterioration from the pre-Whitlam era when we relied on about a two per cent surplus. The previous government accumulated in its last five years $69 billion in deficit, and that was equivalent to 19 per cent of GDP when we took government. We had run external deficits in 28 of the last 31 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we took government, we were using four per cent of our gross domestic product servicing our debt and equity obligations, as debt was used to prop up consumption and to provide services for older Australians relying on some form of social security. What that did was force Australian business people into international money markets to borrow money. It also exposed us to exchange rate depreciations which had a destabilising effect on our economy. We have lived in a country where we have tended to accept, for better or for worse, three to four per cent growth annually. That has meant that we had to rely on foreign capital because of an appallingly low savings rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What that has to do with this debate is that essentially the member for Jagajaga and not all but most of the members on the other side continually say that we are opposed to industrial relations reform, that we are opposed to taxation reform, that we are opposed to health care reform and that we are opposed to social security reform. They oppose the very things that assist us as a nation to improve our productivity. So more Australians work and pay taxes which we can then use to finance the care of older people, and then they turn around and try to oppose those measures 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> which are essential to securing services for the next generation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not often that governments do something that has a long&hyphen;term perspective. I feel very proud to be part of a government that has done one of the things that brought me into public life. As a government we have taken a 30&hyphen;year view of aged care. As noble as the proposition that the government ought to provide for everybody may be to those who find themselves on the other side, the fact is that the government cannot provide for everybody.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Professor Gregory and the other two reviewers of aged-care services in the earlier part of this decade identified that everybody living in nursing homes were by and large living in standards that I would not wish to live in myself or want my mother to live in. They found that, for example, in 1994 we had to spend $1 billion to bring our nursing home stock up to meet health, design, outcome and fire standards, and that 39 per cent of people living in nursing homes were living in bays that contained at least four residents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The solution to this problem is not the application of ideological dogma, it is the application of commonsense. Most of the people who are directly affected by this measure, which requires those who can afford it to make some kind of contribution toward their care, are not complaining about it. Most of the people in my electorate who have complained about this come from a selfish generation who are much more concerned about their rights than their responsibilities and about the value of things rather than values. Most of the people who are affected by this in the medium term are people who sent their husbands to war, who lived through wars, who worked through periods of depression and who did not buy something until they saved up for it. They know that requiring them to pay a small amount of money, if they have it available to them, to be spent only on their care and not taken as profit by some avaricious owner is plain commonsense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One elderly person said to me when I had finished addressing a function on this, `I wasn't too sure about this until I overheard my son discussing it with my husband. My 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8351"> husband said to my son, "What do you intend to do with the house when we die?" My son said straightaway, "I am going to sell it, I am going to have an overseas trip, I am going to buy a car, and I am going put the rest in the bank." I thought that maybe us spending a little of our money on our care when we need it most is not such a bad thing to do.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one thing that I find difficult to cope with in politics. I can understand people who are greedy, I can understand people who are crooks, but the one thing I have trouble with is hypocrisy. While there are many good people on the other side of the House this time, there are many others who are not. They say something to the community which they know to be misleading and which they know goes to the very heart of their emotions&mdash;for example, that the government should not introduce accommodation bonds and fees for nursing homes. Then I find the same people booking into the most salubrious hotels throughout Australia or booking into some of the most prestigious private hospitals over the Christmas period and all those sorts of things. They are entitled to do that, but when they tell the rest of the country to do another thing it really upsets me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another point that I ought to make in relation to older people and that is the misrepresentation on this issue about superannuation entitlements and how they affect a person's unemployment benefits. The measure is only going to require most people affected to draw down some of the interest from their super fund. Their super capital is going to remain intact.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1997 reveals once again this government's blase attitude towards facilitating proper debate in this place. By introducing a total of nine separate amendments in the one tax bill, the coalition has made it impossible for members to make a thorough contribution by way of debate. Instead, we are left with little alternative but to focus on just a handful of provisions and run the risk that the bill as a whole will not be thoroughly scrutinised by the parliament. Because of time restraints, I will be restricted to commenting on schedules 1 and 7 only, and perhaps schedule 5 in the consideration in detail stage, because these are the ones that have generated the most concern in the taxation community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Schedule 1 of the bill proposes to amend the Income Tax Act 1936 to reduce the amount of revenue that will be exposed to thin capitalisation provisions. On the face of it, these changes appear to be unobjectionable. However, tax experts believe they deserve special attention because of the retrospective nature of parts of this legislation, a lack of specificity in many clauses and sloppy drafting in the bill.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Proposed subsection 159GZG(4B) deals with asset revaluation, and it is this subsection that will have a retrospective impact on trusts, partnerships and companies. Clause 13 makes it clear that revaluation reserves for the year 1997&hyphen;98 can be considered only when they appear on the previous year's balance sheet. The problem here, of course, is that many accounts for the 1996&hyphen;97 year were finalised before the government announced that these new provisions would take effect on 1 July 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because business did not know of this intended proposal and did not make the appropriate references in their accounts for the previous year, they will be denied the right to take into account revaluation reserves for that year under subsections 159GZG(3) and (4) of the bill. It seems unfair in the extreme for organisations to be penalised in this way and it is suggested that asset revaluations from 1 July 1997 should be taken into account in the year 1997&hyphen;98 as a transitional measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Taxation Institute of Australia, the TIA, has also expressed concern with the calculations used in subsection 159GZG(4). It points out that the intention of this amendment is to combine the proportion of fixed interest in the capital of the trust and the fixed interest proportion in the net income of the trust belonging to the foreign controller. But there appears to be an ambiguity in the calculation used to determine the figure in subparagraph 159GZG(4A)(ii), which would see an income test superimposed on the first part of the calculation that deals with the proportion of capital.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The TIA asserts that, for those foreign controllers who have 100 per cent fixed interest in the capital of the trust but no interest in the income of the trust, the part of the formula dealing with capital will produce a nil result. In other words, only 50 per cent of the foreign controllers' income fixed entitlement proportion would be taken into account and no allowance would be made for the foreign controllers' interest in the capital of their trust. The TIA has called for this provision to be scrubbed. They argue that there is no justification for it because there is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8355"> no such provision for partnerships and it will, therefore, create an inequity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The TIA believes that the section that denies any foreign equity to a discretionary trust should also be abandoned on the grounds of partiality. While it agrees that trying to qualify foreign equity can be problematic, the TIA believes that the government should adopt a fairer and more substantive approach to this issue. The TIA points out that it is inappropriate to exclude all interest deductions to those trusts falling within the definition of `discretionary trust' on the grounds that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is impossible to reconcile the proposition that the foreign equity `cannot be measured' with the fact that the legislation proceeds on the basis that it is possible to meaningfully quantify the level or percentage of foreign interests for the purpose of determining whether there is a foreign controller of a discretionary trust.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Taxation Institute of Australia has outlined a raft of other deficiencies in this legislation. It is critical of the ambiguous nature of several parts of the schedule and argues that these ambiguities must be clarified before the close of debate in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, the TIA has drawn attention to section 159GZF(1A) that deals with amounts owing by a company which are `guaranteed' or `subject to a security provided by' a foreign controller. It says that there is a need for better alignment between the explanatory memorandum and the bill, and that the definition of `secured' should be changed to read `secured against the assets "of the foreign controller or associate"'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The TIA also suggests that subsection (1B) requires clarification. This inclusion acts to extend relief in cases where the commissioner is content that the resident company could have borrowed the amount from a prudent arm's length lender `even if the amount had not been guaranteed by another person or subject to a security provider by another person'. The Taxation Institute argues that this needs to be clarified by the inclusion of wording to the effect of:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Commissioner is satisfied that the funds could have been borrowed whether or not on the same terms and conditions without a guarantee or 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> security provided by a foreign controller or non-resident associate.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It goes further to suggest that the amendment must include a specific reference as to exactly how the commissioner may be satisfied in this instance. It notes that it will be near impossible for a resident company to demonstrate that discretion was properly exercised in relation to the company under self-assessment if the former were to find itself struggling financially after the loan has already been made. Subsection (1B) of the schedule reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It does not apply in relation to an amount owing if the Commissioner is satisfied that the resident company could have borrowed that amount from a prudent arm's length lender even if the amount had not been guaranteed by another person or subject to a security provided by another person.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The TIA argues that the term `prudent arm's length' requires definition and that there is a potential conflict between the explanatory memorandum and the bill because of the use of the words `even if'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to the TIA, the clear implication in the bill is that an amount can be excluded `if a prudent arm's length lender would have lent the amount, regardless of whether or not the prudent arm's length lender would have required a guarantee or security'. In contrast, the explanatory memorandum suggests that the exclusion will be available only  if the prudent arm's length lender would lend without a guarantee or security by way of support for the loan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The drafting of this legislation is quite shabby in parts. It is likely that we will be back here debating further amendments to those before us today if they are not clarified now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has been asked by the Taxation Institute of Australia to provide more information on the repeal of sections 159GZO and 159GZP of schedule 1. The explanatory memorandum suggests that these provisions relating to back-to-back arrangements, which prevent the application of the thin capitalisation rules, have been superseded by the general anti-avoidance provisions of part IVA of the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In its briefing, the TIA makes it clear that they `do not disagree' with the government's approach, but it notes that: The strict application 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8356"> of the `back to back' rules was widely recognised as having the potential to produce anomalous results.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is suggested that this can be resolved only with a ruling by the Australian Taxation Office to outline the context in which part IVA will apply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Interest deductions in respect of borrowings by foreign controllers of trusts or partnerships will be prevented under section 159GZUA of the schedule. The Taxation Institute believes that this amendment goes way beyond that which was originally announced by the government, because it will effectively prevent interest deductions without taking into account either the gearing ratio or any aggregate gearing ratio of the foreign partner or beneficiary. Further, while the government states in the explanatory memorandum that this measure was announced on budget night in 1996, the TIA proposes that those taxpayers who had existing structures in place prior to the 1996 budget will be affected by this amendment if it comes into force on 1 July 1997, as the government intends.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The TIA argues that, because the coalition did not give a forewarning about this provision, it is now reasonable to delay the commencement debate and allow foreign controllers to repay any outstanding balances owed. The government expects to save an estimated $220 million over three years with the changes to thin capitalisation and suggests that, while there will be an increase in compliance costs on taxpayers, it will be a `minor' increase.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not so, says the TIA, which points out that subsections 159GZG(12) and (13) will demand changes from discretionary interests to fixed interests in some trust structures. That will see additional imposts being borne by those trusts in the form of capital gains tax and stamp duty as well as legal costs. This is just one instance where organisations will have to meet additional compliance costs, and it is questionable whether these costs will be the minor ones the government would have us believe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand the need to protect the revenue from those companies that aggressively maximise the ratio of non&hyphen;arm's length debt 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to equity funding. However, the government has a lot of tidying up to do before the terms of this schedule meet the satisfaction of Australia's peak independent taxation organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Schedule 7 of the bill seeks to give legislative authority to the electronic lodgment of tax returns and amendments for individual taxpayers. Many tax agents who have lodged a return on behalf of a client since the introduction of the electronic lodgment service in 1990 have been following this procedure as a matter of routine. The government suggests that the new electronic method fosters a more efficient processing of tax returns. If this is true, then it deserves support. However, the schedule as it currently stands is not entirely satisfactory. As Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu observed in the July 1997 edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tax Alert</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amendment will obviate the need for individual contracts between taxpayers and tax agents. A consequence of that is that taxpayers will be required to take greater accountability for the maintenance of their taxation records.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">New subsections 161E(1) and (2) indicate that taxpayers will now be responsible for keeping the original copy of their tax return, any declarations they may make and their group certificate for a period of five years. If they fail to do so, they may be liable for a fine of up to $3,000, and presumably that is on top of the penalties which the Australian Taxation Office can already apply. Similarly, there will be a judicial requirement for tax agents to maintain copies of the above documents for every PAYE client over a five-year period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Institute of Chartered Accountants believes that there are a number of inadequacies in this schedule 7. A key concern is the lack of deliberation with industry as to the contents of this particular amendment. The ICA has asked the question, `Why were these proposals not subject to consultation with the professional bodies prior to being presented to the parliament, as previously promised?' Why indeed?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not the first time that the coalition has been criticised for failing to canvass professional organisations prior to drafting legislation. On 18 February this year Mr 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8357"> Dennis O' Neil, the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Council for Infrastructure Development Ltd, criticised the government for opting to axe the infrastructure borrowing schemes `without any consultation with industry'. On 24 March this year the member for Groom (Mr Taylor) in his capacity as Chairman of the Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Treaties reported that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The consultation between the Australian Taxation Office and professional accounting bodies&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">on the International Tax Agreement Bill (No. 1) of 1997&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">was less than satisfactory.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">During debate on the export market development grants scheme in May of this year it became clear that the government had not consulted with industry about the impact that its retrospective legislation would have on exporters. It was only when it was put under intense and sustained pressure by the business community and a few of us in this place that the government recanted on its retrospective plans. When in opposition the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) had this to say on 18 December 1993:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Politics in this country is all about accountability. It is all about the executive exposing itself to the scrutiny of the public and the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I am in total agreement with the Prime Minister on this point, but it would appear that, once again, those on the other side of this House have failed to convert the rhetoric of opposition into action in government. The ICA has also questioned whether the date of effect of that amendment, that is 1 April 1998 for returns and applications relating to the fringe benefits tax and 1 July 1998 for those linked to income tax, will provide tax software developers with enough time to make the necessary changes to software programs. Some tax professionals have expressed concern about the lack of specifics in this schedule and have called on the Australian Taxation Office to clarify its position before the conclusion of this debate. The Institute of Chartered Accountants has asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">How does the new framework, in particular the new penalty provisions against tax agents, relate to the current code of practice for tax agents? 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I understand that the ICA is yet to receive an answer to this pertinent question. Perhaps someone on the other side can oblige us with an answer when they are summing up the second reading debate. The ICA has also expressed concern about the lack of certainty relating to the use of electronic signatures. It argues that this bill does not provide adequate information on what kinds of electronic signatures the ATO will use under the new system and what certification arrangements it will rely on. A similar concern has been raised in the publication <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Tax Weekly</EMPHASIS> , which quotes, apparently, from a paper released around 13 June 1997. It notes that statements made in an electronic return lodged through a tax agent will be deemed to be those of the taxpayer unless the taxpayer can show that the statement was not authorised. It goes on to observe:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The onus of proof is on the taxpayer and the proposed provision&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is, section 222 A(3)&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">does not provide any guidance as to how a taxpayer may be able to show that the statement was not authorised.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is an indictment of the government that the Institute of Chartered Accountants has not been properly briefed on these issues, for they will directly impact on pretty well every one of its 27,000 members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once enacted, the bill will also allow the Commissioner of Taxation to pay a refund into an account earmarked by the taxpayer. The ICA has stated that it is not clear whether the ATO will seek to establish control over the electronic transfer of funds to third parties. It sought clarification as to whether the ATO will require that these transfers be made only into trust accounts operated by tax agents but, to my knowledge, it has not yet received an answer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government's forecasts are accurate, the amendments contained in this bill will collectively generate savings to revenue of around $821 million over four years. We are dealing with amendments that will bring about a significant financial windfall to the government, and yet the persons responsible for the drafting of the bill have shown scant regard for its construction. The confusion that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8358"> the changes in this bill will create for personal and business taxpayers will be enormous if my abovementioned concerns are not clarified immediately.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to be able to follow, as I have on a number of occasions, the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) in this debate on taxation. But in this instance I am able to supplement his remarks with perhaps a little additional advice and I know that my colleague the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles), who introduced this legislation, will be able to supply even further information at the end of the debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Curtin has raised a number of issues that deserve comment, remarks and answers because he is a thoughtful contributor to the taxation debate and certainly one of the most prolific followers of the activities of the Australian Taxation Office and the Commissioner of Taxation. He has made a strong contribution to the parliament with his arguments over a long period of time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to deal with only a couple of issues in regard to this legislation. On thin capitalisation, as raised by the honourable member, I believe that a detailed response dealing with a number of the points that he has raised is available and my colleague will, I trust, be assisting him in regard to those matters. In regard to the second matter that he raised, the proposal for electronic lodgment of taxation returns and the concerns that have been expressed by the Institute of Chartered Accountants, I wish to inform him that I understand that the tax office consulted widely, not so much with the organisation as with the practitioners to see whether they, as individuals, would have any problems with the proposal that an extension to electronic lodgment be made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those discussions produced the legislation that we have before us today and, if there has been an oversight in the discussion with the official bodies representing accountants, that may be a matter of some regret and their 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> comments will be noted. However, I understand that the legislation that we have before us today is the outcome of considered consultations between on&hyphen;the&hyphen;ground representatives of taxpayers in the form of their tax agents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This electronic lodgment process is going to, in the view of the government and in the views of most people, provide a reduction in cost of compliance for tax agents by making the electronic lodgment requirements reflect current business practices. It is part of the role of this government to reduce the cost to businesses of doing business, and a reduction in costs to taxation agents in the way in which they conduct their business is a reduction in the cost to the businesses themselves. So the winners of this process are the taxation agents and the taxpayers themselves. There appears, in my view, to be no losers whatsoever and this announcement is one that should simplify and make more easy the activities of tax agents. There are no financial implications, but it does in fact reduce the cost of compliance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments that are being approved by the House today relate to the electronic lodgment of fringe benefits tax returns, which will commence on 1 April 1998, and they also relate to the electronic lodgment of income tax returns, commencing on 1 July 1998 so that, in the next financial year, income tax payers and their agents will be able generally to lodge more returns electronically and payments to taxpayers&mdash;that is, refunds&mdash;will be able to made electronically.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These amendments allow tax agents who have not got an electronic facility in their practice&mdash;they have not got a computer with a modem hooked through to the tax office&mdash;to use somebody else's. That is a simple thing&mdash;you go down the street or to a nearby office and just lodge the returns electronically straight off your disk straight into the tax office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The changes require a tax agent who transmits a return directly on behalf of the taxpayer to provide the agent's certificate on the return by using an electronic signature, and I have noted the comments of the previous speaker about what sort of signature it should be and what is acceptable. That may need 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8359"> clarification and that will occur, but we have got until 1 April next year for this to happen and until 1 July for income tax payers before that is necessary, so we have some time before we need that detail. But this is a use of modern technology and modern practice to simplify the process and reduce costs. It think that is commendable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, it removes the requirement of the tax agent to keep a copy of his declaration, and it removes the requirement for a tax agent to provide the taxpayer with a copy of a return that is furnished electronically. Of course, most agents do that because it is a simple process that requires the actual taxpayer to be aware of what his commitments are. I think that, in line with the government's commitment to reduce the paper burden on small business and taxpayers, this is an innovation that will be widely endorsed&mdash;I do not know how widely used, but it is an indication of good intent on the part of the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next matter I would like to bring to the attention of the House is the changed proposals in regard to group certificates. This is another initiative that comes from the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) of 24 March this year on the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">More time for business</EMPHASIS>. In that report, the government announced its decision to look at the cost of paperwork to small business and the amount of time they spend dealing with red tape instead of the problems of running their business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister said in that announcement that we as a government would move to reduce employers' compliance costs by removing the requirement on employers to issue group certificates within seven days for employees who cease working. Here is the legislation that delivers on that promise to reduce the paperwork process. It is just an extension of the period from seven days to 14 days, but it does reduce the pressure on the Taxation Office and employers who have made an eligible termination payment or an employee who requests group certificates to be completed at the appropriate time. It just reduces the pressure on employers and employees. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These amendments will come into play on the 28th day after the bill receives royal assent. This is another decision on the part of the government to assist those who are battling paperwork and those who are battling along in small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has produced a number of initiatives for small businesses in the area of taxation, and I just want to stray into the general area because there are so many amendments proposed to tax laws in this area that it is not always possible to identify the exact area. But, picking up the theme of simplification, we have been able to move in a number of areas, like the proposals for group certificates and electronic lodgment. For example, the lowering of the provisional taxation uplift factor from eight per cent to six per cent is a reduction of cost which is mirrored in this legislation by the thoughtful application of modern technology in the transfer of funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The introduction of capital gains tax rollover relief for small businesses is another reduction in cost for small business. There is a consistent approach, whether it be by the use of new technology or by overt action, to reduce the paper war and to change the taxation system so that the cost of compliance and the real costs to small businesses and their agents are effective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Capital gains rollover relief for small business means that when a person wishes to sell their business there is no impost of capital gains tax. That means that, as businesses flourish and a gain is made on them, the proprietor will be able to sell the business and buy another one. It also means that, coming to the end of their working life, a person will be able to sell their business, take the proceeds and invest in a suitable fund and there will be no capital gains tax paid on the whole process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This means that right from the beginning of the operation of a business, through the profitable execution of the business, the sale of the business, the purchase of a new business and, ultimately, to the point of retirement and the use of capital accumulated as a superannuation fund or protection against old age, they can be free of capital gains tax.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8360">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have already mentioned that in this legislation there is a particular application to fringe benefits tax where we relieve the need for hard copy lodgment of tax returns. In addition to these changes of electronic lodgment, by 1 April there will be significant exemptions from fringe benefits tax for small businesses whose total payment for fringe benefits is less than $5,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the government's belief that, whilst there is no cost to the taxpayer in a couple of the specific measures in this legislation, there is a bringing about of uniformity in the thin capitalisation, financial shares and other measures. It is a simplification process, allowing businesses to operate more effectively.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the initiatives that the government has taken to provide easier administration, to reduce paper warfare and to change the nature of taxation, there will be a total of approximately $600 million each year to be reinvested in small business and in job creation. This is not revenue forgone and it is not relief in revenue; it is a process that the government has adopted of a very specific nature.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the area of paper warfare, I would be remiss if I let this opportunity pass without mentioning the report of 24 March entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">More time for business</EMPHASIS>. A major priority for the government is to reduce the impediment to small business imposed by unnecessary paperwork.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope we come to a day in Australia where, as the major item for businesses, small business included, keeping track of the paper to run that business will not be their most significant disability. In survey after survey, businesses are saying to governments around Australia, `Get off our backs. What you are doing for us is too solid, it is too demanding, so you need to give us a break.' It is the government's goal to remove, as the greatest detriment complained of by small business, the fact that they have to spend so much of their time fighting the paper war.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has moved ahead and the legislation today is another step in that process. It is another step to easing things up by electronic lodgment; another step to easing things up by providing relief from the lodg 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment of group taxation forms in the previous seven days. All of these apparently small items fit together under the umbrella of the government's initiative of giving small business people more time for business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been the tax breaks that I have mentioned in part, but the tax breaks that cut down paper warfare in particular and relate to taxation are the fringe benefits tax changes to car parking and taxi exemptions. There have also been the fringe benefits tax education program, and the fringe benefits tax record keeping exemption for employers who submit a return with taxable benefits of $5,000 or less and thereafter do not significantly alter the amount of benefits that are provided. So there is a complete exemption in one area and a simplification in many other areas for fringe benefits tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill today follows the theme set out on 24 March this year by the Prime Minister. The tax payments date changes mean that small businesses may pay estimated tax by 15 December and lodge returns and pay balances by 15 March the following year so that an estimate of the previous due date is made but the exact amounts are paid at a later time. This is a freeing up of the compliance cost and the cost to small business. The proposal that is now legislated means that voluntary tax payments can be made at a time to suit the businesses themselves. A capital gains tax register has been established so that people are relieved from actually paying capital gains tax if their process of registration produces the appropriate result. There has also been a reduction in the number of taxation compliance statements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have covered the range and, Mr Deputy Speaker, you have been very generous in your acceptance of the wide range of topics that have come within  Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1997 . I want to pay tribute to the work done by various committees of the government and the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp) for being assiduous in their application and making sure that there is a reduction in the compliance cost and a reduction in the paperwork in the payment of taxation. In some areas we appear to be going in the wrong direction because the cost of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8361"> compliance is going up. That is where there is a need to bring within the ambit of control and management areas that have been difficult to this point. But the thrust of the government is to reduce the cost of compliance; to reduce the paperwork for businesses, particularly small businesses; and to allow a sensible and fair self&hyphen;assessment process where both taxpayers and their agents can benefit from a system that is clear, simple, modern and effective.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4)  covers a variety of amendments, ranging from quasi&hyphen;ownership of fixtures through electronic lodgment and funds transfer to leasing of luxury cars. It is a smorgasbord of taxation amendments and, as that tax guru my colleague the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) suggested, it really does the government no credit to present for debate such a diverse range of amendments, all important in themselves but impossible to consider in the required depth in the confines of the time available. I will therefore restrict my comments mainly to the measures to address tax avoidance through tax exempt entities distributing funds offshore.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The explanatory memorandum says the bill has been introduced to deal with tax avoidance arrangements of charitable trusts and certain other organisations. These measures, though being implemented by the current government, were originally proposed by its predecessor. The measures were first proposed after extensive investigations by the Australian Taxation Office into tax avoidance schemes uncovered in the use of charitable trusts distributing offshore to avoid taxation. The government has partly withdrawn from its announcement in the budget of 1996 to remove tax exemption from many of the not&hyphen;for&hyphen;profit organisations that allow some of their income to be spent outside Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The main problem with the draft bill was that it simply cast its net too wide, applying, as it did, to any targeted organisation which spent money on activities offshore. After extensive consultations following the release of the draft bill in February this year, the measures have been scaled down somewhat. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> The draft bill would have meant that not&hyphen;for&hyphen;profit bodies such as the Catholic church would have lost their tax exempt status if they spent just $1 of income or capital offshore. Now the measures will only apply to organisations which conduct their activities principally offshore and only to the distribution of income, not to donations or gifts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I still wonder how you decide when an organisation's activities are conducted principally in Australia or, for that matter, principally offshore. For example, how would one classify an Australian charity whose principal activity is offering tertiary scholarships to students from developing countries to come and study in Australia? Should it matter whether the scholarship moneys are distributed to the student offshore or not? And, if the student studies here, are the activities to be counted principally in Australia?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, I wonder what type of hoops organisations will be asked to jump through and what happens to organisations whose activities evolve naturally to encompass more offshore activities. I am sure that in the line of work undertaken by charitable organisations this is often the case. For these reasons, the lack of a definition of just what `principally in Australia' means may cause some problems. The bill seems to leave the ATO with too much discretion for deciding what activities are principally onshore or offshore.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I question how easy it is to quantify an organisation's activities, after speaking to the tax office officials behind the bill I am sure they have got all the bases covered, and perhaps the cases too as they arise. Hopefully, these measures will enable the tax office to get one step ahead of those sham charitable organisations which have used the system to avoid paying their tax. At the same time, I hope the changes do not make things too hard for those genuine Australian charities, church groups and the like which do such valuable work both here and through their overseas programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To give the government credit, the changes made after the release of the draft bill do mean that most sporting organisations, synagogues and churches have regained their tax exempt status. But there are still many charit 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8362"> able organisations, including not&hyphen;for&hyphen;profits, I understand, that will be required to lodge their first income tax return if this bill, as presumed, passes. It is ironic that the religion of sport, which has turned Sunday into the day of sporting devotion, has been successful in lobbying this government to adjust its proposed bill to maintain tax exempt status for both sporting organisations and the churches.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the Australian Taxpayers Association says that the amendments still go far beyond tax avoidance arrangements. So wide is the net still that is cast by this bill, they say, that many not&hyphen;for&hyphen;profits with no association with tax avoidance are still caught by the legislation. I hope that is not the case. The association says this legislation will still tax charitable income that is spent on Australian purposes overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, my research of the intent of the bill and my discussions with Treasury and Tax officials persuade me that the bill will not discriminate against legitimate charitable trusts. Contrary to what some groups have believed, these new measures apply only to the distribution of income made by Australian charities to offshore locations and do not apply to gifts and donations that are distributed offshore. Also, any organisation which wishes to maintain tax concessions can do so by applying for approval as a recognised tax deductible organisation under section 78 of the taxation act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed legislation will hopefully ensure that the only organisations which receive income tax concessions are those which have approached and have been approved by the government as genuine&mdash;at least for a while, anyway. It seems that, as quick as the tax office can devise ways to counter these schemes, the accountants and organisations are looking for alternative loopholes to minimise their tax liability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the existing law, a family trading trust built, say, around a restaurant is able to pay tax exempt moneys to a charitable trust, which in turn distributes this money offshore for allegedly charitable purposes. There is no way of checking the exact use of this money, and in many cases money not used for charit 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> able purposes&mdash;perhaps the vast bulk of it&mdash;is channelled back as tax free income to the family trading trust, with an offshore agent collecting the commission. This tax evasion is estimated to be costing this country far in excess of $100 million a year&mdash;far in excess, according to my information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another system that has sprung up in recent years revolves around companies set up to provide international services for educational organisations. It has been claimed that the loss of tax exemption for some of these is counterproductive and will penalise our education export industry. However, I am satisfied that TAFE or university organisations or other educational bodies will not be penalised by these amendments if they are legitimately involved in delivering tertiary education opportunities offshore.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But some institutions have formed subsidiaries which they claim are educational, and they have engaged in commercial activities offshore such as textbook production or some such similar undertaking, and claim tax deduction from such income under their section 78 exempt status. If universities wish to be considered for genuine tax exemption, they must now do it, if these amendments are passed, under their own name and not some other organisation. That is only fair. Bona fide organisations in offshore educational activities that are genuine should still be able to benefit from tax exemption. I am satisfied the closing of these loopholes will tackle a tax avoidance system rather than punishing educational institutions for their export of education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me move on to another amendment in this bill, relating to thin capitalisation rules. These will reduce the allowable foreign debt to foreign equity gearing ratio for taxpayers who are not financial institutions from 3:1 to 2:1. This covers companies located in Australia who remit income offshore who find it far more advantageous to be funded through debt. In fact, there is a big incentive in the system to build up their debt to equity ratio. This amendment is a sensible move which ensures that an appropriate amount of profit is derived in Australia and increases the equity funding of foreign controllers in Australian enterprise.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8363">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a first step in a series of tax reforms over the next few years that I hope will ensure that foreign investment in this country is for productive purposes and not used to exploit tax deductions. Such a tightening of the allowances is evident in new subsection 159GZUA(2), where a foreign controller of a trust when borrowing from a non&hyphen;resident associate and who uses the borrowed funds to invest in the trust will not derive any allowable interest deduction in respect of the borrowing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me add a few words about the extent to which the taxation system needs urgent surgery&mdash;not just amendments like these, important though they are. The Australian Tax Commissioner, Mr Michael Carmody, told a gathering in Adelaide earlier this month that a hundred wealthy Australians under investigation by the Australian Taxation Office used an average of eight trust funds each to earn a total of $50 million in untaxed income each year. As Mr Carmody says, the legality of the arrangements is not in question but the morality is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of the people investigated by the tax office, one earned $19 million in tax free earnings in 1994&hyphen;95. The vast majority of Australians who are lucky enough to have employment pay their taxes and expect certain services like hospitals, roads, a fair welfare net and equal education opportunities in return for those taxes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The elderly are, by and large, accepting of changes to the aged care arrangements brought in by the government, because they accept the impossibility, with our ageing population, of the tax system supporting all facets of aged care in the years ahead. But they get really angry when they see the extent of tax avoidance in this country: the bludgers and manipulators riding on the back of the PAYE taxpayer while those who have paid taxes all their lives are now expected to give a large bit more from savings or assets to maintain the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government says it is anxious to reform the tax system and ensure that all pay their dues. If a broad&hyphen;based consumption tax is part of the equation, the government must convince ordinary Australian taxpayers and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> those increasing numbers on fixed incomes that all areas of the tax system are as fair as possible. To quote the editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> of Sunday, 14 September:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A GST can have no credibility in the public mind while the kinds of tax minimisation highlighted by Mr Carmody (the Tax Commissioner) continue . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is also interesting to note the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Age</EMPHASIS>  of the same date, where Paul Daley suggests that some of the 15 members of cabinet should absent themselves from discussions on tax free payments through trusts because they manage some investments through trusts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is nothing illegal in family trusts, but, as Mr Carmody has pointed out, the differential taxing arrangements for trusts, companies and pay&hyphen;as&hyphen;you&hyphen;earn taxpayers are unfair and discriminate against those without the means, skills and, in most cases, the desire to exploit the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With these amendments, we are addressing the use of charitable or quasi&hyphen;charitable trusts to avoid tax obligations. This is a good start, but there is far more to be done. Among the plethora of suggested reforms going about at the moment, there is merit in the idea of setting the top marginal rate at 36 per cent&mdash;the same as the company rate&mdash;and setting a reformed trust tax rate at the same rate, thus removing the temptation to look for tax minimisation schemes which, at the end of the day, reward few and penalise many. I commend this Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In dealing with this Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4), we are again confronted with the horrors of the Australian tax system. Enormously complicated as it is, seemingly several times every year governments of whatever political persuasion are obliged to bring in amendments to seek to stamp out the latest range of avoidance schemes that have been developed by the industry or to look at ways the revenue base can be protected or fairness maintained.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Calare (Mr Andren), who has just spoken, very fairly assessed the issues involved in this particular piece of legislation. In my view, he is not always fair in his judgments on issues but, in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8364"> this particular case, he has looked at the details of the issues and come to the conclusion that, on balance, they are fair and worth while.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is, of course, a matter of regret that our tax laws should be lengthened again by further measures of this nature. On the other hand, anyone who is using artificial contrivance measures to avoid tax is cheating on their fellow Australians, and that kind of behaviour should never be tolerated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been concerns that the measures that relate to trusts&mdash;particularly religious and charitable institutions&mdash;could have some adverse effects, but the new legislation is not designed to affect the tax exempt status of any religious or charitable institution that has a physical presence in Australia and incurs its expenditure and pursues its objectives principally in Australia. Some of the scare campaigns about taxes being imposed on church collections on Sunday mornings and so forth are really most unfortunate scare tactics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most Australian institutions which have some Australian personnel overseas&mdash;such as missionaries or teaching personnel&mdash;will not be affected. It is the government's intention to define physical presence in as broad a way as possible. To qualify for continuing tax exemption, all that will be required is for the organisation to operate through a division, a subdivision or the like in Australia. The exemptions available will not apply to an organisation that merely operates through an agent based in Australia&mdash;nor should they.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the new laws, it may be an advantage for some institutions to more closely account for their revenue and to ensure that any exemptions from income tax they currently have are not placed at risk. But there is also the option to retain tax exemption for those organisations which do not qualify for the exemptions previously outlined, provided the parliament grants an exemption by prescribing it in the income tax regulations on a case&hyphen;by&hyphen;case basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, in common with the member for Calare, while I have reservations about the desirability of having extensive additional provisions added to the tax law, on balance one has to come to the conclusion that these sorts of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> practices where facilities have been misused have got to be stamped out by any government that is serious about tax avoidance. Therefore, the bill is indeed worthy of support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, this particular piece of legislation raises yet again the importance to our country of dealing comprehensively with the issue of tax reform. Australia's tax system should be reformed to improve its fairness and to restore incentive to our way of life. Far too often people are asking why they should work and why they should put in the extra hours of overtime or risk their capital when the only reward seems to be ever increasing taxation. Why not just relax on social security benefits, where you can walk away from all these sorts of problems? If the nation as a whole adopts the attitude that it has all got too hard, then our economy as a whole will suffer and we will become less productive and less able to play a worthwhile role as a nation in the international community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For decades Australian governments have been trying to patch up and paper over the cracks in the current system by creating tax law which is unbelievably complicated yet still seems to allow some people to escape the tax net. It has been estimated that as much as $30 billion a year of income goes untaxed as a result of the so-called black or cash economy. Then there are various so-called bottom of the harbour schemes which still seem to manage to survive in our tax system, as was referred to by the honourable member for Calare. Those sorts of schemes are cheating on fellow Australians and are absolutely an unAustralian way of behaving in business or in industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tax avoidance schemes more often are devised by the wealthy because they are the ones who have the financial capability to engage accountants and financial advisers who have the capacity to tinker at the edges of the law and to devise new schemes. Those who do not bother to declare all of their income, such as the taxi driver who puts a little money under the seat or the hairdresser who leaves a little beside the till, or anyone else who does not adequately declare their income, just as surely are cheating on the tax 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8365"> system as those who devise elaborate systems. Tax avoidance tends to be across the board. Both low income earners and high income earners are involved in various schemes, and in my view none of them are tolerable or acceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Income Tax Assessment Act contained just 126 pages when it became law in 1936. By the time the coalition had come to office last year, the act had grown to almost 4,000 pages. In all, Australia now has more than one million words of tax law spread over almost 8,000 pages. Is it any wonder that people cannot understand what is going on and need so much professional advice just to fill out the most elementary of returns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In spite of cutbacks and rationalisation in the tax office, it still costs over $1 billion to operate our tax system. The public demand more services from government and they complain whenever there is a cutback. They certainly also object whenever there is talk of any kind of a tax increase. To this government's credit, it has been able to rein in the budget deficit without resorting to new taxes and tax increases. That is a lesson I hope other governments will learn from in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This federal government was left with something like $90 billion of Commonwealth debt, almost $70 billion of which was accumulated in the last five Keating years. Labor, the great taxers, were also the great spenders. While the coalition government, through careful expenditure restraint, expects to return the Commonwealth budget to surplus next year, there is a limited capacity to make further cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, the states are dependent upon Commonwealth grants for over half their income, and recent High Court decisions have further restricted their revenue raising capacity. Even local government now receives a significant proportion of its revenue from Commonwealth grants. It would be far better if the states and local government had the revenue raising capacity on their own to collect sufficient income for their own needs without being dependent upon federal handouts, which are always less than they would like to receive.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By world standards, Australia is heavily dependent on income tax for its total tax revenue. The burden is falling most heavily on people with average earnings. Forty years ago, a taxpayer needed to earn 19 times average earnings in Australia before he paid the highest marginal tax rate. Unless changes are made, within about five years a person on average earnings will be paying the top rate. This is despite the fact that Australia's highest marginal rate of 47 per cent is the tenth highest in the OECD. By contrast, the highest marginal rate in Switzerland is 11.5 per cent, and you need to be earning 9.5 times average earnings before you pay the top rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia has the fifth lowest dependence on consumption taxes for revenue. Most of that comes from taxes on fuel, cigarettes and alcohol. In Australia 40 years ago, a taxpayer on average earnings paid a top marginal rate of 17 per cent. Today a person on average earnings pays a top rate of 43 per cent. Australia's wholesale sales tax system is incredibly complicated, has six different rates&mdash;from naught to 45 per cent&mdash;and is full of anomalies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Biscuits are taxed but not caviar. Flavoured milk and orange juice are taxed but not plain milk. Engagement rings are taxed at 32 per cent, but wedding rings are tax free. Sinks are exempt, but taps are taxed. Toothbrushes are exempt, but toothpaste attracts a tax of 22 per cent. If food is bought for livestock it is tax free, but if the same food is bought for a pet, it is taxed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many people consider that a goods and services tax would be a fairer way to raise funds. A GST would apply at a single rate to almost all goods and services and would therefore treat all purchases evenly. Some items and services would be more expensive as a result, but many others would be cheaper. As a GST is always rebatable on business and production costs, a GST reduces the tax burden on manufacturing and industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The introduction of a GST would be a major boost to our exporters and would make them better able to compete with other producers around the world, most of whom have the tax benefits of a GST system. A GST would raise a substantial amount of money 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8366"> which could be used to eliminate other taxes such as wholesale sales tax or to reduce income tax, petrol tax, payroll tax or any other of the scores of taxes already imposed on Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A GST is also more effective at taxing the cash economy. While people who are prepared to cheat may be able to initially avoid a GST, eventually they will use their ill&hyphen;gotten gain to purchase an item or service that will be captured by the GST net.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia has a very low level of personal savings. Of course, this is one of the reasons why there is insufficient Australian capital available to prevent the sale of Australian companies overseas. It is far more sensible therefore to tax expenditure rather than earnings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no incentive for an ordinary person to earn extra income if almost half of those extra earnings goes to the government in tax. Why bother to struggle to put aside for retirement when your high taxes fund a welfare system? On the other hand, a GST tax does disadvantage people on fixed incomes and those who cannot benefit from income tax cuts or other tax reductions. Any new taxation regime must therefore include compensation such as higher pension payments and assistance to self&hyphen;funded retirees to ensure their real purchasing power is maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A GST is not the only tax reform option that could be considered. There are lots of ideas being put around at the present time. Some are supporting the introduction of a debits tax on all financial transactions. Such a tax has the benefit of simplicity and could potentially raise a huge amount of money, but it seems to me that a debits tax is unfair on businesses and others who require a large turnover to earn a small or maybe even a negative income. Pensioners and those who do not pay tax at all at the present time would have to pay debits tax, and there would be a great incentive for them to hide their money under the bed to avoid the system altogether. Indeed, loss making enterprises may be forced to pay substantial amounts of debits tax with no prospect of it ever being recovered. That kind of system would certainly create a number of difficulties.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party have also entered the tax debate. They have made a number of suggestions. Perhaps the ones we should take most seriously are those that are coming from no less a figure than the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans). A television interview on 17 August, when dealing with the very difficult issue of vertical fiscal equalisation&mdash;that is, the need to provide arrangements so that the states are able to better raise revenue for themselves&mdash;reports Mr Evans as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The truth of the matter for those who get very excited about Commonwealth&hyphen;state tax imbalances is that the states can redress that balance in a number of ways," Mr Evans said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Not only through service taxes, but through the old chestnut of property and inheritance taxes, through additional surcharges of income tax and, of course, through payroll tax which they've got already."</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So the opposition do have some solutions to the tax problems: a whole range of new taxes. Labor's solution is that the states should fend for themselves; they should introduce&mdash;listen to this!&mdash;service taxes. They make out they are opposed to goods and services taxes, but Mr Evans suggests that the states should introduce a services tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor favourite is property and inheritance taxes&mdash;death duties. Labor's solution to Australia's tax needs is death duties&mdash;taxes on death. They squeal about nursing home entry contributions, but they are prepared to tax everyone in death. Whenever people consider Labor's approach to taxation issues, they should remember their suggestion for tax reform: the reintroduction of death duties. When the people of Queensland vote at the next state election, they should remember that Peter Beattie's promises about expenditure will be funded under the Labor plan by the reintroduction of death duties. Labor have always believed in death duties, and they are determined to reintroduce them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They have also suggested income tax surcharges by the states&mdash;new and extra taxes. While the states are working hard to get rid of payroll taxes, Labor is proposing that they be increased as a way of funding the necessary needs of the states. Labor has learnt nothing from their rejection at the last poll. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8367"> Their solution to Australia's revenue problems is a whole stack of new taxes raised by the states. They pretend that they are not keen on a GST, but as John Miller said on 4BC in Brisbane this morning:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . funny, wasn't it, to hear Kim Beazley yesterday issuing the dire warning that if we voted for a GST, we'd be stuck with it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Why? Because a Federal Labor Government would not repeal it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yes, funny that. And although they might give 15 other good reasons why it would not be repealed, I believe the real reason Labor would stick with a GST is simply this: Kim Beazley, like his predecessor Paul Keating, knows a GST, as part of a sensible package for the reform of our taxation system, is one of the only real ways out of a system which, as "Lawsy" puts it, taxes achievement and rewards sloth.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is the hidden Labor agenda. They really believe in the GST. They hope that we might introduce it so that they will not have the problem, but when it is there they will be proud champions of it. They have already suggested that the states should introduce it because they have not got the courage to do it but shadow Treasurer Evans, if he ever gets the opportunity in government, is certainly going to impose this new range of tax measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats also have some ideas about new taxes. They have always been keen advocates of death duties, and they are advocating a new range of environment taxes. But this government is acting. As our nation approaches the 21st century, few would disagree that we must ensure that our tax system is appropriate for the needs of a modern and progressive nation. The government wants a fairer and better, more modern system which provides incentives to work, save and invest. The tax system should be designed to promote jobs, exports and investments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why the government has taken action. A government members task force has been established to look at the options. It has been given clear riding instructions: any new tax system should, firstly, not increase the overall tax burden&mdash;we do not believe in extra taxes&mdash;secondly, involve major reductions in personal income tax with special 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> regard to the taxation treatment of families; thirdly, consider a broad based indirect tax to replace some or all of the existing indirect taxes; fourthly, provide appropriate compensation for those deserving special consideration; and, fifthly, address reform of Commonwealth-state financial relations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are worthwhile objectives and the government is to be commended on the community consultation process that has been put in place so that all Australians can participate in assessing the merits and demerits of our current system and work towards developing a system that meets our country's needs for the next century. That is a worthwhile objective and an important goal in reform. I commend the government's initiatives in this regard.</PARA></SPEECH>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> measures or other measures put into place to get rid of the regressive impact of the GST do not last. That is the experience overseas&mdash;they do not last. For example, if you say, `We will give pensioners an additional payment to deal with the regressive nature of the GST,' what happens the next year or the year after when you have to increase that payment because of inflation or some other factors? The government finds a reason not to increase that payment. This has been proven to be the overseas experience with indirect taxes of this kind. What happens? Those people fall further behind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In other words, you might start off by designing a GST which is supposedly non&hyphen;regressive by compensating people, but you have to rely on the goodwill of the parliament and the government to put into place every year or every second year measures to keep compensating people. Governments wanting to cut budgets and cut corners will come around to the view, `This year we will not bother to compensate the pensioners for the GST effect.' And what happens? The poor get poorer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While we are talking about the taxation system, I must say that we should be concerned about what is happening in relation to poverty in this country. If the honourable member and others were concerned about fairness and justice, they would be concerned about the fact that we have had to bring this bill into the parliament as a result of some very wealthy people doing everything they can to avoid paying any tax or any reasonable tax. That is happening in this country as a result of these rich people finding ways to get around the tax system all the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should have bipartisan cooperation in this parliament to ensure that those people who are making a lot of money in various forms of income do pay their fair share of taxation. I should have thought that we would have been able to get  bipartisan agreement on that point. But that is not what is happening. Many wealthy individuals have not paid tax to any significant level in this country, to the point where the Commissioner of Taxation himself has said, `I am very concerned about this matter,' and he wants to put in place a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8369"> number of measures. Some of the measures in this bill will try to deal with some of those issues. But this is not enough. There needs to be a lot more done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to focus on this fact: while all this is happening and the rich are getting away with taxation rorts&mdash;not all the rich but a significant number of them&mdash;we are sliding into poverty in a very serious way in this country. A report released the other day from the Social Institute at Melbourne University indicated that 40 per cent of Australia's children are now under the Henderson poverty line. That is a national disgrace. More and more people are sliding under that poverty line, especially children. We are not going forwards; we are going backwards under this government in dealing with the problems of poverty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the honourable member for Wide Bay or any of the other honourable members come into this House and put forward proposals for a taxation system which is going to benefit the most disadvantaged in our community, and which is going to assist the poorer sectors of our community and lift them up so that we do not have so many people in poverty, then you can say that we are talking about a fair taxation reform system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is in this context that we need to deal with some of the gratuitous comments made by the honourable member for Wide Bay about the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans). The honourable member for Wide Bay totally misrepresented and took out of context the comments made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said that there are options available to the states. He did not say that the Labor Party is committed to the states taking up those options. He was simply saying that there are a number of options in relation to the states which can be discussed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Deputy Leader of the Opposition was also not saying that the Labor Party is committed to the introduction of death duties, inheritance taxes or any taxes of that kind. What he was saying, what the shadow ministry has said, what the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) has said and what the deputy leader has said is that the Labor 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Party is in favour of taxation reform but we are ruling out one thing&mdash;we are ruling out the GST. By ruling out the GST, we are saying, `The Australian people have rejected it, we understand the regressive nature of it and we are not going to go with it.' Other options are being considered. The other options that are being considered will be considered after we have received the report of the committee that was set up by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That committee does not have a broad representation from the community. That committee is made up of a group of bureaucrats. It may be that they will come up with a good report. On the other hand, they may come up with a report which is totally out of touch with the concerns of ordinary Australians. Who is to know what sort of report they will come up with? The Prime Minister has deferred this issue for a few months by setting up a committee, a committee that he did not consult the opposition about. He did not say, `Look, let's try to get a broad mix of people who represent various interest groups.' It was essentially a committee of bureaucrats. I do not want to reflect on them; they might come up with some sensible ideas, although the government has put in place a number of parameters which limit the kinds of options that they can come up with. Having said that, let them come up with whatever options they come up with and we will consider them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Wide Bay made one mistake in his statement. He said that a GST can be the basis of reductions in taxation. The GST can replace certain other taxes but it cannot be the basis for the reduction of taxation by itself. There have to be other means of ensuring the basis for the reduction of taxation.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8370"> have been sold something which is potentially very regressive. Even if concessions are made in terms of programs put into place that might negate this regressive effect for a period of time, as I said earlier, this regressive effect may actually make things very difficult later, because you cannot count on those programs remaining in the system and helping those individuals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously, from a positive point of view, we all have to think about ways of moving forward in terms of taxation reform. Rather than getting up and attacking each other's proposals by saying, for example, that there shall be no consideration of this type of tax or that type of tax, as the honourable member for Wide Bay has done, we ought to be asking ourselves: what have been the problems both here and internationally with those forms of taxation? The other question we need to ask ourselves is: how should we direct the taxation concessions? Should they be directed merely towards individuals or should we look at taxation concessions that will help industrial development in this country?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has received a very important report&mdash;the Mortimer report on industry development. That report recommended that we look at the question of taxation concessions in relation to industry. If we are really going to try to get industries going in this country, it is very important that we compare Australia to overseas experience. When countries like those in the European Union, such as Ireland, and when countries in Asia are offering significant concessions for specific types of projects in relation to industry development&mdash;manufacturing projects, not any business but specific types of projects to build our manufacturing industries; that is what other countries are doing, including Ireland&mdash;why should not we think about that, especially in the context of the Mortimer report? It seems to me that we should.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should not merely be thinking about what concessions we can make to individuals in the taxation system. I do not see why we should be making major concessions to those on the top level of the income scale. Why should we do that? Why should we not be 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> thinking about holding on to that money and using it to encourage investment in employment and in manufacturing industry? That is something which is possible in the context of the Mortimer report. That is one of the serious matters that the Labor Party wants to look at. We are going to look at what other countries are doing in relation to taxation concessions to boost up those businesses which are involved in the creation of jobs in the manufacturing sector of our economy. I am referring to those businesses where we can say, `All right, we will replace something that we are importing with an Australian production and we will also go for an export oriented industry.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is in this context that we are opposed to what the government did in terms of reducing R&amp;D from 150 per cent to 125 per cent. I know that some people think that this is simply symbolic. It is not symbolic, because a lot of companies have been saying, `This makes a big difference to us and this has had a negative impact on the expenditure on R&amp;D in this country.' We should look at that and say, `Hang on, perhaps we should think about restoring that kind of R&amp;D expenditure in terms of the taxation system.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another thing that was taken out by the government in a short&hyphen;sighted way was the system whereby we gave grants to companies to build trade overseas and to invest overseas, especially in the Asian region. And you know what happened when the government dealt with the EFIC scheme in the way that it did? We had protests from many countries that were counting on that scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we should look at those sorts of initiatives because in the modern competitive world, let me tell you, it is not a level playing field at all but a cut&hyphen;throat market where, if you can prop up and give an advantage to some of your own companies, you can get exports and help in the employment for your own people. That is the reality. Perhaps that should not be the reality, but that is the reality of the world. That is the reality of what is happening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Irish Republic managed to convert, within a space of 20 years, an economy that was 75 per cent dependent on agriculture to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8371"> an economy that is now 75 per cent dependent on high level manufacturing and computer based industries&mdash;high technology industries. They did that through taxation incentives. I am not necessarily saying that we should go as far as the Irish did, but I am saying that we have to look at those sorts of initiatives to really boost our industries&mdash;and that should be part of the taxation debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At question time today, the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) had a go at the Americans because on the same day that they were talking about the need for free trade, et cetera, they were putting in quotas and restrictions. This is what governments do. Governments are saying, `Yes, the idea of free trade is okay, but when it comes to protecting our national interests, protecting our industries and ensuring that our industries have concessions, including taxation concessions, which are necessary, let's look after the national interest.' That is what the Americans, the Chinese and all the major economies of the world are doing, and some small economies of the world are doing that as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is Australia doing? Australia is going around saying, `We have to lead the way in cutting our protection, cutting our tariffs, and not support our industries in any way through concessions in the tax system.' All these sorts of things lead to creating more unemployment. The other day the Deputy Leader of the Opposition asked the Prime Minister a question which was not answered. The question was: how do we explain the fact that for the first time in modern Australian history we have had growth in the economy but increases in unemployment?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have to ask yourself why that is happening. It is happening because, in many situations, although we have had growth in certain sectors of the economy, in key areas where a lot of people are employed industries are closing down. They are going overseas; they are going to other parts of the world, especially Asia; they are importing the product back into Australia and workers are losing their jobs. That is the kind of the situation which, of course, can have this abnormal effect where the overall economy grows but where you have serious conse 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> quences for key areas of the economy&mdash;for example, the manufacturing industries&mdash;that employ a lot of people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a good thing that we had the decisions on the car industry and the TCF industries, but that is not going to be enough. We cannot rely on the existing industries. We have to promote investment, especially in the new high technology industries. In that regard, we must do more through the taxation system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude my comments on the bill by saying that we support most of the provisions of the bill that deal with the rorts. We support the provisions of the bill that are trying to ensure that wealthy people pay their share in the economy. We support those provisions, but we say that a lot more needs to be done. We need a tax system which protects, boosts and supports the poorer section of our community. We also need a tax system that is going to support industries, especially manufacturing industries, so that we can support employment in our community and the development of our society. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I will quickly pick up one or two comments made in the debate by the previous speaker, the member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous). I was a little amused at his comments about tariffs, considering the great fall in tariffs which occurred under his government. No doubt, he was a supporter of those cuts in tariffs on textiles and on the motor car industry. I see he is shaking his head. The debate on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R280">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4)</XREF>  has been wide ranging, and the involvement by the member for Calwell was certainly very wide ranging. Other people involved in the debate have asked some fairly specific questions, particularly the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher). There are some answers I can give the member for Curtin in a range of areas there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an omnibus tax bill and it contains a number of measures. The measures include: announcements in the 1996 budget relating to thin capitalisation measures to address tax avoidance through tax exempt entities distributing funds offshore; an announcement by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) concerning eli 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8372"> gible finance shares; the announcement in the 1997 budget to freeze the trustee rate for friendly societies at 33 per cent from the 1997&hyphen;98 and 1998&hyphen;99 income years; easing the compliance cost burden for employers regarding group certificates for employees ceasing employment; and amendments to give legislative force to administrative arrangements for electronic lodgment of tax returns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In regard to the thin capitalisation measures, they will improve the effectiveness of the thin capitalisation rules and counter&hyphen;avoidance arrangements. For taxpayers who are not financial institutions, they reduce the allowable foreign debt to a foreign equity gearing ratio of three to one to two to one, and in relation to companies they broaden the definition of `foreign debt' to generally treat certain guaranteed debt from unrelated overseas lenders as `foreign debt for thin capitalisation purposes'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ratio assists in ensuring that an appropriate amount of profit is derived in Australia and in protecting Australia's revenue base. The measure was foreshadowed by the Labor government in February 1996 and was adopted formally by the coalition government in the 1996 budget. An exposure draft of the legislation was released for comment earlier this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In regard to thin capitalisation, I know that the member for Curtin raised a number of issues. In particular, he referred to a submission from the Taxation Institute which raises several issues. In that regard, the Australian Taxation Office has recently received a similar submission from the Taxation Institute and a draft response has been prepared by the Australian Taxation Office, and I would just like to make a few comments in those areas which will also go to the Taxation Institute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to proposed new subsections 159GZF(1A) and (1B), which deal with guarantee debts, you indicate that you consider there is a need to clarify the intended operations of these provisions. It is the intention of the Australian Taxation Office to revise the contents of income tax ruling IT 24/79, `Application of thin capitalisation rules', and issue a new ruling in its place. It is intended that the issues surrounding the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> operation of the new guarantee debt provisions will be discussed in the new ruling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The comments that have been raised on new subsection 159GZG(4) highlight the concern that the capital component of trust equity contains an income test. The words `if regard were had only to the use of the trust property in producing assessable income', in subparagraph (ii) of paragraph A of subsection 159GZG(4), do not act as an income test, as there is no requirement that there be a distribution of income to the foreign controller or its non-resident associates. Rather, the relevant property merely needs to produce assessable income of the foreign controller or a non-resident associate of the foreign controller. This prevents the foreign controller from gearing off property that does not produce Australian assessable income, such as foreign assets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The operation of this new subsection was carefully considered whilst the amendments were being drafted, and it is not inconsistent with the existing provisions relating to the definition of `foreign equity for trusts'. The operation of the provision only affects those cases where the related party's foreign borrowings exceed the prescribed ratio and foreigners control the trust property and have a fixed interest in the trust property but redirect the income to non-related foreign persons. The provision, whilst playing an important role, is not expected to have an adverse effect on legitimate tax structures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Your comments in relation to proposed new subsection 159GZG(4B), dealing with asset revaluation of reserves of partnerships and trusts, highlight your concern that the legislation will have a retrospective effect. You submit that asset revaluations of 1 July 1997 should be taken into account as a transitional provision in the 1997&hyphen;98 year. Both the original announcement by the previous government and a subsequent announcement by the coalition government to amend the thin capitalisation rules clearly stated that asset revaluations by partnerships and trusts would be limited to the market value of the assets and that the revaluations would be required to take place before the income year commences. Taxpayers, therefore, have had in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8373"> excess of 12 months to prepare for, and react to, the announced changes. The issue of timing was carefully considered by the government when preparing the amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also raised were concerns in relation to the amendments that disallow a foreign gearing ratio for discretionary trusts. This results from the fact that the foreign equity of a discretionary trust cannot be measured in a meaningful way since entitlements depend on the exercise of the trustee's discretion. In particular, a foreign beneficiary of a discretionary trust does not have an interest in the corpus or income of the discretionary trust until the trustee makes a distribution of corpus or income to the beneficiary. It is accepted that some discretionary trusts that wish to obtain the benefits of deductions on interests paid to foreign controllers of their non-resident associates may need to convert to a fixed trust so that fixed interests can be measured.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The submission indicates that such changes may involve legal costs and have stamp duty and CGT implications. The government was aware that there would be some associated compliance costs associated with the amendment but consider that the amendment was necessary to clarify the operation of the provision and to counter some avoidance arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Comments in relation to the operation of a proposed new section 159GZUA highlight concern that the operation of this provision is inappropriate and contrary to the previous announcements made by the government. The government recognises that this measure may adversely affect taxpayers with existing structures in place that intend to comply with the lower debt equity ratio announced in the 1996 budget. Accordingly, the government has removed an amendment to the rules as they relate to foreign investors of Australian partnerships and trusts. Section 159GZUA was withdrawn as a part of these amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lastly in this area, your comments in relation to the repeal of sections 159GZO and 159GZP, and the proposal to instead rely on the general anti-avoidance provisions contained in part IVA, indicate that you do not disagree with that approach. You also indicat 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ed that you perceive a need for the Australian Taxation Office to clarify, by way of a public ruling, the way in which it would regard part IVA as having application to back&hyphen;to&hyphen;back arrangements. It is intended that a public ruling be issued that will deal with the types of back&hyphen;to&hyphen;back arrangements to which part IVA would be applied. I hope that gives the member for Curtin some of the information he has been seeking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have just a few further comments. In regard to the measure to address tax avoidance through tax exempt entities distributing funds offshore and charitable trusts and removal of tax exemption for certain overseas organisations, this measure was foreshadowed by the previous government during February 1996 and formally adopted by the coalition in the 1996 budget with some modification.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The measure addresses avoidance arrangements which take advantage of the tax exempt status of charitable trusts and closes off the possibility of certain organisations which also currently enjoy an income tax exemption from being used for tax avoidance purposes. An exposure draft of the legislation was released on 20 February 1997 seeking submissions from interested parties on the proposed measures. Following those representations, modifications were made to the draft legislation concerning the exposure draft requirement that an organisation must be located in Australia and undertaking its work solely in Australia. The bill relaxes the solely in Australia test so that organisations in paragraphs 21, 23E, EA, F, G and J(3), need only pursue their objectives principally in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson) raised one or two points in his contribution to the debate on this matter, and I would like to address them for him. He expressed concern about the effect of removing the tax exempt status of commercial educationally based bodies that do not incur their expenditure and pursue their objectives principally in Australia. The proposed changes will not affect the tax exempt status of educational institutions that have tax deductibility status under section 78 of the Income Tax Assessment Act such as public universities and approved TAFE institutions within the mean 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8374"> ing of the Employment, Education and Training Act. This will be the case whether or not these institutions pursue their objectives principally in or out of Australia, and whether those objectives incur commercial activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The extent of commercial activity undertaken by tax exempt entities outlined raises a much broader issue of whether such organisations qualify for tax exempt status under the existing law. When the tax exemption for these organisations was first provided it was never contemplated that significant business and commercial operations would be undertaken by these bodies. In view of the recent developments in case law and the increased commercial activity of some entities in recent times they might like to consider approaching the Australian Taxation Office to confirm the taxation status of the organisations outlined in their letter that came to the Treasurer in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In regard to financial shares, the amendments I will move later will ensure that dividends paid on eligible finance shares, EFS, and widely distributed finance shares, WDFS, are subject to tax by denying them non-portfolio status and a credit for foreign tax paid by non-residents. The amendment will stop tax avoidance schemes which are associated with EFS and WDFS. It was never intended that non-portfolio dividend status would extend to dividends paid on EFS and WDFS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In regard to the rate of tax for friendly societies, the amendments implement the 1997-98 budget announcement that the rate of tax imposed on the life insurance businesses of friendly societies is retained at 33 per cent for the 1997-98 and 1998-99 income years during the duration of the review of the taxation treatment of life insurance that was initiated in the 1995-95 budget but not completed by the former government prior to the election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill removes the requirement imposed on employers to issue a group certificate within seven days of an employer terminating employment to reduce compliance costs unless the employer requests a group certificate. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally in regard to electronic lodgment and electronic funds transfer, the electronic lodgment of tax returns was introduced in 1990. The service was administered by contracts with participating tax agents. The Australian National Audit Office and the JCPA criticised this practice, and recommended that electronic lodgment be incorporated into tax legislation.The bill amends the income tax laws and fringe benefits tax law to provide for electronic lodgment of returns, applications for amendment and other notices and to allow the commissioner to pay by electronic transfer any refunds to any account nominated by the taxpayer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Curtin did raise some questions about consultation. There was widespread consultation and there was even consultation which went as far as Western Australia in regard to this matter. It was also raised at the Australian Tax Office electronics commerce forum. So there has been consultation in regard to that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion on electronic lodgment, I would make these comments. In developing the bill the Australian Tax Office did widely consult with practitioners to develop a system to protect taxpayers and minimise compliance costs. In particular, the Australian Taxation Office met with agents and accountants in Western Australia&mdash;who often feel, I think, ignored in a consultative process. So we did go out of our way as a government to consult in Western Australia. The concerns raised by the Institute of Chartered Accountants have been put to the Australian Taxation Office. Unfortunately, much of the ICA's concern relates to the inability of one of its advisers to understand some of the provisions in the bill and the requirements in the current law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Two weeks after the introduction of the bill, the Australian Taxation Office met with the taxation director of the Institute of Chartered Accountants. Following these discussions and meetings with the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants, the National Institute of Accountants, the Taxation Institute of Australia and the Income Tax Professionals, the government has decided to make amendments to the bill and to make the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8375"> electronic lodgment of returns better fit the business practices of tax agents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to comments by the member for Curtin that taxpayers are required to keep a copy of returns, that is not correct. There is no requirement in the current law and in the bill for tax agents to keep a copy of the return. Taxpayers will be required to keep a copy of the taxpayer's declaration. This will assist them to prove that they did not make statements in the electronic return transmitted by the tax agent where an error is found.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tax agents will not be required to keep a copy of the declaration. This is one of the changes in the amendments to the bill that come out of consultations with the professional bodies. I thank the members who have participated in the debate. I commend this bill to the House and I will be moving some 37 amendments shortly.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">I make the following comments about each of the amendments that are proposed. On thin capitalisation, the amendments go through from (1) through to (9). Amendments (1) and (2): a schedule of the bill introduced amendments to the thin capitalisation rules contained in division 16F of part III of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to improve the effectiveness of those rules. The amendments included the denial of all interest deductions on related party borrowings by foreign controllers of Australian partnerships and trusts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, some concern has been expressed that the proposed denial of all interest deductions on related party foreign debt by foreign partners, beneficiaries and trustees of Australian partnerships and trusts is inequitable and inconsistent with the thin capitalisation regime policy. In response to those concerns, the government has decided to withdraw the provision from the bill that denies all interest deductions on related party foreign debt that is incurred by foreign controllers to invest in an Australian partnership or trust and subject them instead to the new general foreign debt to foreign equity gearing ratio of 2:1 proposed by other amendments contained in schedule 1.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This will provide foreign partners, beneficiaries and trustees of Australian partnerships and trusts some scope for borrowing from related parties to invest in the partnership or trust. The underlying Australian partnership or trust would remain required to comply with the foreign debt to ratio equity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment (3) amends the definition of foreign investor so that foreign partners, beneficiaries and trustees are no longer ex 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8377"> cluded from the thin capitalisation rules and will now be permitted to obtain deductions for interest paid on borrowings from related parties up to the 2:1 gearing ratio. Amendments (4), (5) and (6) amend the provisions dealing with the measurement of the foreign equity in relation to partnership and trusts to remove an element of ambiguity from the amended provisions and to ensure the provisions operate as intended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment (7) will clarify that the equity that a foreign beneficiary has in a discretionary trust will be limited to their fixed interests in the trust, thus denying such beneficiaries a gearing ratio to the extent their foreign equity cannot be measured because of the existence of the trustees' discretion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment (8) is a technical correction that will ensure that all of the thin capitalisation provisions reflect the change in the foreign gearing ratio from 3:1 to 2:1 contained in schedule 1.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment (9) deletes the provisions contained in schedule 1 which disallow all interest deductions on foreign related party debt incurred by foreign partners, beneficiaries and trustees. The amendments apply from the 1997&hyphen;98 income year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now move to two amendments to the proposed group certificate provisions affecting terminating employees and one amendment to the provision for group certificates issued in consequence of an eligible termination payment. These are amendments (10) to (12).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill reduces the current obligation contained in the tax law for employers to issue group certificates to all employees who terminate their employment during an income year. It proposes that the obligation exist only for those employees who request a group certificate during an income year. Employers have seven days in which to issue a group certificate when an employee makes a request.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Changed arrangements in relation to the sending of blank group certificates by the ATO to employers may have made the seven&hyphen;day period difficult for employers to meet in certain circumstances. Blank group certificates are now sent to employers late in a financial year rather than at the beginning.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendments (10) and (11) replace `7th' in proposed new paragraphs 221F(5CA)(d) and 221F(5CA)(e) with `14th'. The change will provide employers with sufficient time to meet their obligation under the law. Amendment (12) makes a similar change to existing subsection 221F(5H) that relates to group certificates in respect of eligible termination payments. The amendments will apply from the twenty&hyphen;eighth day after the bill receives royal assent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Measures to address tax avoidance through tax exempt entities distributing funds offshore relate to amendments (13) to (15). Since the bill was introduced, there have been a number of representations concerning the requirement for charitable trusts to change their trust deeds before July 1998 to prohibit distributions overseas if they are to retain their income tax exemption.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The concern is that this requirement may be onerous, especially where a will creating a testamentary charitable trust cannot be amended because the living testator is no longer capable of conducting his or her own affairs. In response to those concerns, the government has decided to amend the provisions to remove this requirement. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> The amendments will also make it clear that charitable trusts which have gift deductibility status and are permitted to distribute funds offshore&mdash;for example, overseas aid funds&mdash;will remain eligible for the income tax exemption.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Electronic lodgment of tax returns is covered in amendments (16) to (37). Following consultation with tax agent representatives, the government has decided to make amendments to the bill to the reduce the costs that would otherwise be imposed on the tax agent. The provisions as currently drafted impose an obligation on a tax agent to keep a copy of the taxpayer declaration authorising the transmission of the return. Tax agents are also required to give a copy of the transmitted return to the taxpayer. The amendments will remove these obligations. They will also enable a tax agent who does not have electronic facilities to furnish a return by electronic transmission through the services of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8378"> another person who has the facilities. I commend the amendments to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As we are becoming increasingly used to, the government has circulated a large number of amendments to this bill, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4). There are 37 separate amendments being moved, indicative of the fact that the government just cannot get its legislation right.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Almost every bill in this portfolio which comes before this chamber has to be extensively amended by this government. This shows a complete inability to properly consult and to properly think through issues and potential impacts. The amendments cover four separate areas: the thin capitalisation provisions, the group certificate provisions, the tax exempt entities provisions and the electronic transaction regime for the tax office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the first group of amendments, the thin capitalisation provisions, this is a same&hyphen;day backdown. The bill as introduced amended the thin capitalisation provisions to completely deny discretionary trusts a gearing ratio, to the extent that their foreign equity cannot be effectively measured because of the existence of the trustee's discretion. This seemed a reasonable approach to the opposition. By treating discretionary trusts in the original manner&mdash;that is, in accordance with trust law&mdash;the flexibility and distribution which are afforded by the trust are offset somewhat by the fact that the thin capitalisation rules were much more severe&mdash;that is, the government had apparently decided that there can be both tax benefits and tax costs to using trusts. However, the government has now decided to amend its own law, which will actually facilitate the use of trusts&mdash;this being done within two weeks of the Commissioner of Taxation bringing to public notice the potential tax avoidance consequences. So, no sooner had we praised this government this afternoon than it backed off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) to explain why this decision has been made and where the public benefit is in loosening the rules to allow foreign investors to pay less Australian tax than they otherwise would. We 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> want to know why the change is being made, who lobbied the government to make this change and how much the change will cost in tax not collected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the same day, we hear reports of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) assuring his backbench that preferential tax treatment will be retained for trusts. The position of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) has become increasingly untenable. The Commissioner of Taxation, who is in a unique position to know what is happening in the tax system, has clearly indicated his preference for a change in the law to eliminate some aspects of inequity in the tax system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was reported today, by George Megalogenis in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, that Mr Carmody's speech is believed to have been authorised by the Treasurer's office. There is a review of the taxation of trusts announced in the budget, currently examining the issues raised by Mr Carmody. The Prime Minister has now improperly pre&hyphen;empted that review by ruling out any meaningful reform. Why does he want to do this? Who is he trying to protect? What are the public servants who are conducting the review of the taxation of trusts supposed to do now? They are going to read these press reports and it will be difficult for them not to be influenced by them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where is the Treasurer on this issue? It is his processes which are being overridden, and responsibility for this issue lies with his portfolio. It would seem that the real agenda of the government is to pretend to improve the equity of the system but to protect privilege, rule out meaningful reform and then throw up their hands and say, `It is all too hard. We have to have a GST.' We, on this side of the House, ask: how can the Prime Minister tax food, clothing and the basic necessities of Australian families yet rule out fair changes to business taxation because they might offend some powerful interests? We are interested in pursuing this issue between now and the time when the legislation is debated in the Senate to get proper answers to these questions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second group of amendments, amendments (10) to (12), relate to the group certificate provisions and propose to vary those new 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8379"> group certificate provisions. Basically, the maximum time for an employer to be able to provide a group certificate to an employee who leaves employment during a financial year is to be increased from one week to two weeks. Briefing of opposition staff by the tax office has indicated that these amendments are necessary to allow time for the employer to obtain blank group certificates from the tax office. We accept this explanation at face value and have no objection to the proposal at this time. If any representations are made to us about this modified proposal, we will raise those in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third group of amendments relates to the changes to the anti&hyphen;avoidance provisions of tax exempt entities. Amendments (13) to (15) attempt to deal with an issue I raised in the second reading debate, namely, the impact of the bill on wills and other trusts which may have power to distribute moneys offshore. The bill, as it stands, currently requires that the trust deed must prohibit distribution overseas in order to retain its tax exemption, unless the trust was established by will prior to the 1996&hyphen;97 budget announcement. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> This requirement in the bill would, in many cases, have necessitated trustees of charitable trusts to amend their trust deeds if the deeds permitted overseas distribution. However, the government has realised that there would have been significant difficulties in actually amending the trust deeds, for example, where the testator is no longer capable of conducting his or her affairs and where no valid power of attorney has been executed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On first blush, these amendments will overcome what is a valid concern. However, we have to be convinced that this represents a completely adequate solution. I guess the question here is: could these amendments be rorted? We will not be voting against the measure. We will be looking closely at the implications of these amendments prior to the bill's consideration in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, amendments (16) to (37) deal with some technical amendments to the legislative regime covering electronic lodgment and the payment of moneys electronically. The amendments seem reasonable to the opposi 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tion and we will not be opposing them. The first amendment allows agents to lodge electronically through a third party. This is a sensible amendment which will allow greater flexibility for tax agents and hence for those taxpayers who use tax agents. The second amendment discontinues the obligation on the tax agent to keep a copy of the declaration relating to an electronically lodged return. Instead, it continues the obligation on the taxpayer but allows the tax agent to hold the declaration on behalf of the taxpayer. This is a sensible amendment which is supported by the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other three amendments lessen the otherwise overly onerous record keeping and other documentary requirements which are being placed on tax agents. These are all non&hyphen;contentious and are supported by the opposition.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The amendments to schedule 1 proposed by the government attract my attention. But before I comment I would like to thank the Parliamentary Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) for the answers he has been able to provide to matters of concern that I raised on behalf of myself and others during the second reading debate. Whilst I did listen carefully to his second reading summing up, I will not have picked up all the detail. I will not have absorbed it all and probably something I say in these remarks will have been answered. That is just a demonstration both of the complexity of the legislation in total and of the lateness of the notice and details of the amendments which we are now discussing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Subsection 159GZG(4B) has been widely criticised because of its retrospective effect on the thin capitalisation provisions. There does not appear to be anything in the government's amendments which reverses the impact of clause 13 of schedule 1. If I am right in that assumption, those businesses which finalised their accounts for the 1996&hyphen;97 year prior to the announcement of the government's intention to alter the thin capitalisation ruling will be penalised unfairly, in my view. Although the government has conceded some changes to subsections 159GZG(3) and (4), there has 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8380"> been no decision that I could pick up in what has been said this evening to put in place a transitional measure. In fact, I think the parliamentary secretary specifically excluded that possibility on the grounds that the parties had adequate notice. I am not sure if that is an accurate appreciation of the situation, but I will have to leave it at that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Tax Institute of Australia called for a review of the calculation that it would see that part dealing with the proportion of the capital superimposed with an income test. I understood the parliamentary secretary to say that the income test does not come into play. I think I have it in its right section; if so, all well and good. Despite the fact that it would almost certainly cause a disparity if it has not been attended to in the treatment of trusts on the one hand and partnerships on the other, it may well be that the government does intend to push ahead with what I believe to be a flawed amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The TIA has made it very clear that they hold deep reservations about other ambiguities that pervade this bill, and not all of those have been addressed by the parliamentary secretary. I made reference to a couple of examples in schedule 1, specifically to the loose wording of subsections 159GZF(1A) and (1B). However, the definition of the word `guaranteed' as it appears in subsection 159GZF(1A) has not received attention in the government's supplementary amendment. Nor has the government, as far as I am able to gather through listening to what has gone on tonight, chosen to provide a clarification as to how the Commissioner of Taxation will determine whether thin capitalisation provisions will be extended to those resident companies which borrow amounts from a prudent arm's length lender subject to certain constraints.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I indicated, the TIA and others believe that the clear implication in the bill is that an amount can be excluded if:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a prudent arm's length lender would have lent the amount regardless of whether or not the prudent arm's length lender would have required a guarantee or security.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is in marked contrast to the information provided in the initial explanatory memoran

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I was saying, the Taxation Institute of Australia called on the ATO to explain how part 4A of the Income Tax Act will apply to thin capitalisation. There is no reference to either section in the government's amendments that I can discover. As I understand it, the ATO has not obliged the tax community with any further information on that particular point. The government has been make aware by the TIA of the potential for anomalies in the strict application of back&hyphen;to&hyphen;back rules, but apparently&mdash;again I qualify it to the extent of what I am able to pick up out of tonight's proceedings&mdash;it has decided to ignore that warning when drafting amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to go on now to schedule 5. As with schedules 1 and 7, the concerns expressed by independent analysts about schedule 5 in the bill stem from a lack of specifics in the wording of the schedule. On 20 August 1996 the Treasurer (Mr Costello) made it clear that the coalition meant to follow the lead of the former Labor government and introduce changes to legislation affecting tax exempt organisations distributing funds offshore. The fact that two successive parliamentary reports into tax exempt entities revealed exploitation of the charitable trust exemption suggests that change has to occur, and that is not argued against.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I am not convinced that this amendment is as well drafted as it ought to be. For example, the Treasurer's media release of 20 August 1996 made repeated references to the fact that bona fide or genuine charities would not be affected by the proposed legislation. Certainly, if the powers to prescribe exemption status are applied in a way that allows bona fide organisations to qualify, this will be the outcome. But, as the Taxation Institute of Australia pointed out:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The material in the earlier exposure draft indicates that these powers would only be exercised in exceptional circumstances. Accordingly, there is a need for clarification of an intention to use the power to prescribe in an appropriate fashion on a general basis to exclude bona fide organisations and not only in exceptional circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Section 23(j)(ii) removes the exemption provided for funds that have been established by will or by instrument of trust for public charitable purposes that are located offshore. Interestingly, this provision requires that a fund must pursue its charitable purposes solely in Australia, while every other provision of the schedule utilises the words `principally in Australia'. The tax institute also believed that the term `distribution overseas', as it appears in section 23(j)(ii) of the schedule, is not clear in its meaning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These may be only minor points but they are a further demonstration of a seeming lack of consistency and accuracy in the drafting. The institute pointed out that subparagraphs (A), (B), (C) and (D) of section 23(j)(ii) appear as if they are alternatives because of the use of the word `or' at the end of each explanation. Consequently, a charitable trust may find that it no longer qualifies for exemption if it is used for more than one purpose, despite the fact that each purpose in isolation would allow it to qualify. The institute seems on good ground to assert that there does not appear to be any sound policy reason for such a restriction. If in fact a charitable trust can be used for more than one purpose and still qualify for exemption, this needs to be clarified by the government. Either way, the authors of the bill are guilty of poorly worded legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Treasurer's media release on budget night 1996 stated that the measure to remove the tax exempt status for certain organisations located offshore would `not impact on any entity which is a resident for Australian tax purposes'. But the Taxation Institute of Australia pointed out that the measures as presented to the House do not contain that exclusion. It is suggested that any exclusion should be included where appropriate in the legislation where the taxpayer is a resident in Australia. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8382">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final observation I want to make about schedule 5 relates to information contained in the compliance cost impact statement. The explanatory memorandum tells us:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The measures are being enacted primarily to prevent tax avoidance. However, the requirements are consistent with the existing accounting practices and standards of other areas of taxation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That begs the question, so what? Whereas the other compliance cost impact statement in the bill gives some insight into the associated cost to business of the proposed changes, this tells us absolutely nothing about the costs tax exempt entities can expect to incur. That omission undermines the whole intent behind including such impact statements in legislation, and it should be totally unacceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments to schedule 5&mdash;the amendments to the amendments, that is&mdash;appear to be restricted to removing the requirement that a trust deed of a charitable trust must prohibit distribution overseas after 1 July 1998 in order for it to retain its income tax exemption. That is a welcome amendment. However, the bulk of the concerns raised by some of those who have communicated with me in regard to the original bill have not been dealt with by these amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Taxation Institute of Australia observed that the wording of the original bill requires that a fund must pursue its charitable purposes solely in Australia, whereas the term `principally in Australia' is used in every other provision in the schedule. The government's amendments do nothing to explain this or to correct it, if indeed it is the anomaly it appears to be. Further, the supplementary memorandum fails to clarify the term `distribution overseas' as it appears in section 23(j)(ii) of schedule 5, despite the fact that organisations like the TIA have criticised the lack of specifics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nor do amendments alter the wording of section 23(j)(ii) subparagraphs (A), (B), (C) and (D), as I think I have already noted. I also noticed earlier in this debate that those subparagraphs are written as if they are alternatives, because the word `or' is used at the end of each explanation. The impact of this could be quite devastating for charitable trusts because, while each of these subpara 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> graphs may in isolation extend tax exempt status to an organisation, a charitable trust may discover that it is no longer exempt if it is used for multiple purposes. The government is well aware of this, I think, but I do not see anything in what it proposes that will do anything about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another important omission is the absence of an amendment relating to the issue of the impact of the bill on entities which are residents for tax purposes. On budget night 1996 the Treasurer was quite specific that such organisations would not be affected by its decision to remove tax exempt status for certain entities located offshore. However, neither the original government bill nor the amendments now before the House include any such assurance or exclusion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to turn now, briefly, to schedule 7. The amendment to remove the requirement for tax agents to keep a copy of the declaration over a five&hyphen;year period and to provide the taxpayer with a copy of their return or application for amendment&mdash;that is, furnished electronically&mdash;is a good one. Had this amendment not been made, this provision would have resulted in a massive increase in administrative work load for all accountants practising in the field.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new proposal should have a more favourable impact on tax agents in time saved and reduced compliance costs. The Institute of Chartered Accountants was concerned about whether the proposed penalty provisions against tax agents who did not conform to this requirement were consistent with the current code of practice of tax agents. I think I am reassured by what the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) had to say on that, but, given the government's decision to remove these obligations, it does now appear that that expressed concern is no longer a valid one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ICA also registered its concerns about the lack of information relating to the electronic transfer of funds to third parties in the original amendment. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> There is nothing in the supplementary explanatory memorandum to clarify whether the ATO will require that a transac 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8383"> tion of this kind be made only into a trust account operated by tax agents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another point I wish to raise about schedule 7 is the fact that the government has neglected, it seems, to provide any certainty about the use of electronic signatures in its amendments. Despite the fact that several tax organisations requested that the coalition issue further information as to what kind of electronic signatures the ATO will rely on under the new system and what certification arrangements it proposes, there is nothing mentioned in the government's amendments about either. The coalition is tightening up the procedure for the transmission of returns without a tax agent's signature, but this, I suggest, is a separate issue from the one involving the authorisation of a statement by a taxpayer. There is still nothing in the legislation&mdash;as it will be&mdash;that suggests what a taxpayer might do to show that a statement was not authorised by him or her. That, surely, is not acceptable.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA STYLE="Para">The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R273">Health Insurance Commission (Reform and Separation of Functions) Bill</XREF>  seeks to make two major changes: the separation of Medibank Private from the Health Insurance Commission and the widening of the role of the Health Insurance Commission. The Labor Party does not support the separation of Medibank Private from the Health Insurance Commission. However, I would like to put on record that the opposition does recognise the excellent work done by the Health Insurance Commission and its leading role in data and claims processing and is not opposed in principle to changes which would enhance this role, provided that they do not in any way threaten existing Medicare and pharmaceutical benefits scheme roles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition opposes the separation of Medibank Private for a number of reasons. The first is that we fear this is the first step in privatising the fund. The government has put a number of provisions in this bill to prevent full privatisation without new legislation. That is good in theory, but in practice the fund has to be separated before it can be 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sold off. So this separation is a necessary first step.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, the government has reversed its earlier decision to close a loophole which would allow the effective privatisation of the fund without any new legislation. In the Senate committee hearing on this bill, the chairperson, Senator Knowles, informed the committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the bill is being delayed by one week in the House of Representatives to enable further consideration on tightening the provisions which would prevent any possible future privatisation of Medibank Private without necessary parliamentary approval.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">She went on to ask a question of one of the witnesses:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am interested to know . . . which party or parties you see would be the advocates of privatisation, given that it is the coalition that is actually amending the legislation that way.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">However, the government is no longer proposing any such amendment. Given that Senator Knowles was so convinced that the amendment indicated the coalition's commitment not to privatise, one must now wonder about the significance of the decision to abandon that amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps the biggest reason for our concern about the eventual privatisation is the lack of any good reason for these changes. It is clear who is driving health policy in this matter. It is the same group who is driving so much of the rest of this government's health policy&mdash;the private health funds. The private health funds want to see Medibank Private privatised. The Australian Health Insurance Association's submission to the Industry Commission inquiry said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth has no more role in operating a private health insurance organisation than in running an airline.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Industry Commission report also indicated the views of one National Mutual Health Insurance. It said that they `considered that Medibank Private should be de&hyphen;linked from Medicare and privatised'. Australian Unity `considered that Medibank Private could first be corporatised and then ultimately privatised'. So the cat is out of the bag.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8385">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second reading speech begins with the statement that the purpose of the separation is to `ensure that Medibank Private cannot be perceived to have any competitive advantage over other private health funds'. This extraordinary statement says a great deal about this government and its health policy. It says a great deal about the extent to which it has been completely captured by the private health funds. It is a very sad state of affairs when the nation's chief health policy maker starts openly making policy at the bidding of the health funds on the basis of their perceptions&mdash;perceptions, I might add, that have been repeatedly refuted before the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Previous consideration of cost apportionment between the Health Insurance Commission and Medibank Private by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts in 1992, for example, found `no evidence that cross-subsidisation occurs between Medibank Private and Medicare'. On top of this, the current cost apportionment principles were determined in consultation with the Treasury and have been considered acceptable by the Commonwealth Attorney-General.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the second reading speech of the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) it was admitted that he is favouring the self-interested advice of the health funds over that of the Treasury. This is the same minister who gave the health funds $1.7 billion of taxpayers' money, ripped out of the public health system in the most catastrophic health policy for decades.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This massive diversion of public health money to the funds has been criticised by a very broad range of groups: the Australian Medical Association, the Industry Commission and even the Premier of Victoria, Jeffrey Kennett, who described it as `money down the drain'. This minister is not the minister for health but the minister for health funds. Just like the failed $1.7 billion of so-called incentives, the separation of Medibank Private may serve the interests of the health funds, but it will do very little good for anybody else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Industry Commission report into private health insurance found that Medibank Private generally had lower than average 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> premiums. This highlights one of the most important reasons for maintaining the current arrangements. If Medibank Private is able to offer lower premiums than other funds, this is of direct benefit to Medibank Private members. It also places pressure on the other funds to keep their fees down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not surprising that the other funds want to nobble Medibank Private. I hate to think that we would see the possibility of yet another round of premium increases, but it is extraordinary that they are able to force the government to cave in to their special pleading. As was the case with the government's privatisation of Australian Hearing Services, this government's version of competition seems to involve sabotaging public providers for being too cheap and too efficient to make it easier for the private sector to compete with them&mdash;an extraordinary view of efficiency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has already made it clear that it intends to dismantle the network of Medicare offices around Australia. The closure of 44 offices has already begun, and the number would have been double had it not been for massive public pressure. One of those offices is in my electorate in Heidelberg, and the consequences of the closure of this office are very significant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the first instance, it will affect the local traders in the shopping mall in which this office is located. The traders in the mall are already suffering significant hardship as a result of declining retail turnover. They have indicated that the closure of the Medicare office will have a detrimental impact on their businesses, as the Medicare office draws people to the centre.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many local residents will also be severely disadvantaged, particularly our older residents. The minister has suggested that they mail their claims or use the nearest Medicare office, but many of them cannot afford to wait for reimbursement by mail, and attending another office will be very difficult for those who are old or frail. I have received many telephone calls and letters about this closure. I have also received a petition signed by 2,000 residents of Heidelberg protesting against the closure of this office. I have written to the minister for health asking that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8386"> he reconsider the closure of this office, and I very much look forward to a favourable response on behalf of the residents of Heidelberg.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given that the government's intentions are so clear, we are extremely concerned about the forced separation of Medicare and Medibank Private offices. There will obviously be significant costs for both organisations in reorganising their branch network, and a Senate committee was told that Medibank Private will establish only 70 branches instead of the current 270. Once again, the government is penalising Medibank Private members to please the other funds. The separation will also force another reorganisation of the beleaguered Medicare office network, as many offices will be forced to relocate to smaller areas or pay higher rents. It is another example of the familiar pattern that sees Medicare customers penalised to please the funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another concern the opposition has with this bill is the long-term impact upon staff. The bill provides for staff transferred from the Health Insurance Commission to the nominated company which will run Medibank Private to retain their terms and conditions of employment and other rights and entitlements. These are defined in the bill. Staff will also be allowed to transfer back to the Health Insurance Commission during the first year of the new company's operations. However, the bill also gives the minister power to transfer staff from the Health Insurance Commission to the new company against their wishes and to retransfer them back to the Health Insurance Commission against their wishes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are particularly concerned that the bill seeks to limit staff mobility rights to 12 months. In recent similar situations, including the ACT Public Service, the Civil Aviation Authority and Australian Defence Industries, staff moving to the new body have been able to retain their ability to move back to their original employer for three years if they were to be terminated by the new employer. The government's attempts to undermine the conditions and job security of over 1,000 Health Insurance Commission staff who will move to the new Medibank Private if this bill 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> passes is not acceptable and would set a very unfortunate precedent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition will also be seeking to ensure that the current Health Insurance Commission staff get the right to apply for jobs within the Australian Public Service and will retain those rights. The opposition will steadfastly resist attempts by this government to undermine the rights of public sector workers through this sort of staff shuffling trick.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The job security of staff employed by both the Health Insurance Commission and Medibank Private will be undermined by these changes. We have already seen numerous examples of staff rationalisation or sackings in other public sector organisations by this government prior to privatisation, and one can understand the anxiety now being felt by staff at Medibank Private who fear for the security of their jobs in the longer term. Their concerns are no doubt heightened by the general environment in which these changes are being introduced, with public sector jobs being contracted out all over the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The hypocrisy of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in the area of public sector jobs is absolutely astounding. On Monday in question time he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . no policy objective of the government assumes greater importance than that of job security.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Yet in a mere 18 months his government has destroyed 62,000 public sector jobs. Is it any wonder that we have grave concerns for the future of the staff of the Health Insurance Commission?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The explanatory memorandum to the bill claims that the separation will be at no cost to the taxpayer. It seems perfectly clear to us on this side of the House that there will at least be significant transitional costs and that these costs will be borne by the taxpayer to please the health funds. Information provided to the Senate committee confirmed that there will be significant costs for fit&hyphen;out alone. The answer provided by the department estimated the fit-out costs for a new Medibank Private office will be $80,000. Even if Medibank Private drastically reduced the number of offices to 70, this will still be a cost of around $5 million.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8387">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the face of this evidence from the department, are we still asked to believe that there will be no costs associated with removing and relocating 270 Medibank Private offices and leaving Medicare offices in locations which are too large? Are we to believe that separating and in some cases duplicating the computer networks will not cost anything at all? Are we to believe that there will be no cost to moving and possibly re&hyphen;moving thousands of staff?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Or is it perhaps that the government is not prepared to be open about how much the taxpayer will be forced to pay to satisfy the whims of the private health insurance funds, or will the extra costs be offset by savings elsewhere&mdash;as yet undisclosed&mdash;closing maybe another 40 Medicare offices as planned last year? I would appreciate it if the minister, in any future contribution that he might make to this debate, could itemise the cost of these and other elements of the transfer&mdash;both the transitional and long&hyphen;term costs&mdash;and inform the House and the public whether the explanatory memorandum is wrong about a nil financial impact or whether there are other offsetting savings which have not been made public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, there is a long line of losers and very few winners from this legislation, which makes it very hard for us to understand why it is being enacted, other than for the reasons we have outlined&mdash;that the private health insurance funds do not like Medibank Private being where it is. The losers are the staff at the Health Insurance Commission and Medibank Private, who will be subjected to considerable upheaval and uncertainty. A question mark remains over the long&hyphen;term security of their jobs. Medibank Private members will have fewer retail outlets and may face higher fees if the economies of scale that now apply are lost through separation from the Health Insurance Commission and declining membership resulting from contracting outlets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other private health fund members may suffer rising charges if the competitive force exerted to date by Medibank Private is weakened. Taxpayers will be required to contribute to the costs of replicating computer and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> information systems, re-arranging branch networks and managing the transfer of more than 1,000 staff. Taxpayers will also be the losers if Medibank Private is eventually privatised. And the only reason the government can offer in the face of all these disadvantages is that they wish to address Medibank Private's `perceived' advantage over other private health funds. There is no evidence of actual advantage; it is `perceived' advantage over the private health funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an unfortunate thing that it seems to be the case that the health minister is nothing more than a puppet of the private health funds and that his complete policy failure on private health insurance and on the funding of public hospitals is hurting all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will be moving substantive amendments in the Senate. In the meantime I commend the second reading amendment to the House.</PARA>

In speaking to the bill I wish to address the issue specifically of the separation of Medibank Private from the Medicare offices in the Health Insurance Commission but I also intend to make some comments about the recent concern in the community about increases in private health insurance premiums.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I spoke earlier today about the things I do not like about politics. I suppose I can put up with cheats, liars and people who are deceitful&mdash;that is part of our day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day work in this business&mdash;but the one thing that I have great difficulty with is hypocrisy, and I have just heard another illustration of it. In 1991 when the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) was running what was euphemistically known as the `national health strategy' I attended one meeting at which she said&mdash;I am sure she will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;that the role that she envisaged for private health insurance was 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8388"> to simply provide a private room for somebody if that is the kind of thing they thought they might need. Now we have the member for Jagajaga railing against the idea that we might separate Medibank Private, which covers 26 per cent of the health insurance market, from the Health Insurance Commission. Her new&hyphen;found concern for the survival and viability of insurance companies is something that I admire.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I realise that members on the other side tire of us reminding them of it, but what of the Commonwealth Bank? One thing about the member for Jagajaga and the member for Banks (Mr Melham) is that at least they are consistent. They are not individuals who would have been enamoured of the privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank. At least they are very consistent on these sorts of things, but there seems to be inconsistency creeping in here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Jagajaga is obviously having a very tiring time over there because there are not many carrying the intellectual load; mind you, there is not a lot to carry there. To say that Medibank Private derives a perceived advantage from being collocated with Medicare offices and then go on and argue that there are going to be huge increases in costs, technology, relocation and staff&mdash;all of these things which are not true&mdash;you are saying that there is an advantage that is being given to Medibank Private at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind the members on the other side that when they were in government and it was put to them repeatedly by sensible individuals in the community that there was a problem with Medibank Private being collocated with Medicare offices, they repeatedly said that there was no economic or other advantage being bestowed upon Medibank Private with its collocation. In fact, there is not, and we are about to find out when this bill is finally passed, notwithstanding amendments that may be made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing that I would like to point out in the amendment that has been put up to this bill is that the opposition is condemning the government for the closure of Medicare offices. Again, you have to ask yourself: 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> where do we draw the line? The opposition is refusing to allow us to focus on those reforms which are necessary to lift this country's productivity by arguing against taxation reform, against necessary reforms in the labour market, against reforms in government regulation and in turning the government's finances into a surplus, as we had up until the pre-Whitlam era. They rail against that and now they are saying, `You can't close Medicare offices.' The closure of Medicare offices has absolutely nothing to do with this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are closing 43 offices in city areas across Australia where they are relatively close to other Medicare offices, where patients will continue to have access to mailing claims, where we are soon to introduce electronic processing from doctors' surgeries and where people can travel a reasonable distance to another Medicare office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Jagajaga has had 2,000 signatures opposing the closure of a Medicare office in Heidelberg. I have had 9,000 signatures about the closure of a Medicare office in St Ives in my electorate. What I have said to those people who have signed that petition and the 400 people who wrote a letter is, `We need to remember that in other parts of Australia some Australians don't have work. There are people who have known nothing other than poverty and debt in their lives. Having to travel eight kilometres to the next Medicare office, if you don't want to mail your claim form, and to keep them open in rural and regional areas where country towns are literally dying, is perhaps not such a major sacrifice to make.' Once I made these statements, the complaints stopped coming in.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The $5.2 million that is being saved by closing those Medicare offices is a lot of hard earned taxes paid by a lot of hardworking people. With 80 per cent of general practitioner's services being bulk-billed in many parts of our city areas, there is a questionable need for those offices, but that is another issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill provides for the establishment of Medibank Private as an independent statutory corporation. It arises from a recommendation of the Productivity Commission and its inquiry into the regulation of the private health insurance industry. Medibank Private will be a separate legal entity from the Health Insurance Commission with its own board, its own assets and offices separate from Medicare offices, with which we are all too familiar. The bill will also ensure preservation of public sector mobility and the rights of staff to go from one place to another to the new Medibank Private Corporation. It will also facilitate the apportionment of assets and liabilities between the two entities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a perception in the private health insurance industry that, because Medicare and Medibank Private share premises, the nation's largest private health insurer is seen to gain a competitive advantage from one-stop shopping and economies of scale achieved through the shifting of administrative costs to the government funded HIC infrastructure. The bill simply gives effect to the government's commitment to competitive neutrality in the industry, as Medibank Private will now be seen to be subject to the same competitive pressures as other funds. As a result of this separation, the Health Insurance Commission and its board will now be able to focus on the core functions of processing Medicare benefits and pharmaceutical benefits in addition to the subsidiary payments services such as child&hyphen;care rebates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose of a Medicare office is not to keep politicians elected to come up here. It is not to keep public servants employed. The role of a Medicare office is to process Medicare claims, pharmaceutical benefits and child-care cash rebates, at least at the mo 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment. That is the primary purpose. If we are running a company, Australia Incorporated, and we are trying to return the finances of this country to surpluses, as we are determined to do, you have to look at everything. You have to look at the core activities of Medicare offices. The core activity of a Medicare office is not to support a private health insurance company, albeit in perceptual terms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not a sell&hyphen;off, as has been suggested, but rather it will maintain Medibank Private as a wholly owned government business enterprise. We have not gone as far as the Labor Party did with the airlines or the Commonwealth Bank and sundry other things that they privatised. Medibank Private cannot be sold without further amendment of the act by parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I notice that opponents have argued, amongst other things, that Medibank Private will now endure higher costs. However, Medibank Private and the previous Labor government constantly argued that Medibank Private was in no way subsidised by the Health Insurance Commission. I am sure that they were right, and the veracity of those assurances will now be tested. You cannot say one thing in government for 13 years and then suddenly go into opposition&mdash;into opportunistic opposition, I might add&mdash;and suddenly reverse the arguments, as we hear day to day. Is it any wonder that the Labor Party lacks credibility in the community when they maintain these kinds of views?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will also enable the Health Insurance Commission to take on additional functions such as health payment services and the provision of health information. A possible future expanded role for the commission could be as a national payments agency for all government funded transactions in the health sector, as recommended by the National Commission of Audit. I understand at the moment that the government has no plans to do this, but it remains, nonetheless, a possibility. The payment of the child&hyphen;care cash rebate will probably be transferred to the new Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In its recent report on private health insurance, the Industry Commission found that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8390"> Medibank Private achieved lower management costs per membership than the rest of the industry but was unsure to what extent this reflects a statistical artefact, genuinely higher technical efficiency or cost shifting to Medicare. Again, to counter the arguments that are being put up on the other side, it stands to reason that an insurer that has 26 per cent of the market must, by definition, have better economies of scale than one that might be covering only 20,000 or 30,000 contributors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The General Manager of Medibank Private, Mr Ken Macdougall, was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> on 24 April this year as saying that Medibank Private's links with the Health Insurance Commission were `neither holding back Medibank Private nor putting it a step ahead of other insurers'. If you cannot trust the person who is in charge of Medibank Private, if this person cannot be relied upon to give us accurate statements, then what in the blazes is the opposition on about?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The General Manager of Medibank Private has said that he does not believe that the relationship with the Health Insurance Commission is either holding it back nor, more importantly, giving it any kind of market advantage. He has written to Medibank Private contributors assuring them that premiums would not rise as a result of the year&hyphen;long process of separation. There are pressures on premiums, which I will get to in a moment, but they will not be due to the separation of Medibank Private from Medicare. Many Australians would obviously ask themselves why the government is in the business of running a private health insurance company when there are others who are literally working the marketplace as private operators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Productivity Commission report in terms of private health insurance premiums made a number of comments. On page 196 the report said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Average hospital insurance premiums increased by around 75 per cent from the years 1989&hyphen;90 through to 1995&hyphen;96. The consumer price index increased by 18.7 per cent over the same period leaving a real increase in private health insurance premiums of around 46 per cent. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The reason I make emphasis on that point is that in government at the time was the Labor Party, now opposition. When private health insurance premiums were increasing at a critical rate, and when the most sensible health minister they had, Graham Richardson, was arguing it was important to maintain a critical mass in private health insurance of around 40 per cent, premiums were increasing, on average, 12 per cent per year, not one of those applications for a premium increase had been rejected by the Labor Party in government and there was an 18.7 per cent real increase in the first five years of this decade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The hypocrisy that really gets in my craw about people in opposition now criticising the minister and the government for private health insurance premium increases gives me cause not to sleep too easily. I also find it rather hypocritical that the ideologues of the Labor Party&mdash;and I know the member for Jagajaga could never be described that way&mdash;against all that was sane, sought to undermine private health care either deliberately or through wilful neglect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a series of things that were done by the Labor Party in government that have brought us to the position that we are in now. Firstly, they said that Australians did not need private health insurance, but now they are here today complaining about the fact that we are going to separate Medibank Private from Medicare.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It reached a crescendo during the 1993 election campaign when, from the Royal Adelaide Hospital, the then Prime Minister, Mr Paul Keating, whose personal wealth at the time was estimated to be $5 million, said to the rest of Australia, `You don't need private health insurance because Medicare and the public hospital system can look after you.' On the same day, one of my patients in a public housing estate in Hobart, who worked as a volunteer cleaner for a then Labor minister, said to me, `Dr Nelson, I go without food to pay for it.' In other words, what the Labor Party was doing was ignoring the very thing that the blue&hyphen;collar working men and women of Australia knew to be right. They knew that our health care system had evolved 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8391"> from egalitarian principles and a health insurance ethic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you read the newspapers you will find that what certain individuals from the Labor movement were doing every Christmas was booking into some of the most prestigious private hospitals in Australia. In Christmas 1995, we had the Keatings, the Whitlams, the Hawkes and a whole string of these people booked into one of the best private hospitals in Australia&mdash;and I applaud them for doing that. I am not in the least bit critical of that. They have every right to do it. But what really made me angry was that those same people were out there saying to the million families in Australia earning less than $40,000 per year, the 850,000 pensioners and the half a million people on health care cards that they did not need private health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At my first meeting with the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) when she was the health minister and I was the President of the AMA, an organisation not known for its left-wing views&mdash;and this is one of the reasons why I am here; if she had taken a different approach, I would still be living a decent life&mdash;do you know what she said to me? She said, `People are wasting their money having private health insurance.' She said that people were wasting their money having private health insurance and that they ought to do what she did. When I asked what that was, she said, `Well, I've been in hospital a couple of times in the last 18 months and I paid cash.' That is a perfectly legitimate thing to do. But as I listened to this, I thought to myself, `Hang on, that's all very well for people who are ministers, whatever the political colour of the government, but what about the people who struggle, really struggle, to pay their private health insurance?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are the kinds of values of the now opposition who are trying&mdash;they think, with some credibility&mdash;to attack this particular measure. Then, add to that the fact that they removed their subsidies from the reinsurance pool which were worth $220 million in 1996 dollars. They then in 1987 forced the private health insurance funds to pay 25 per cent of the Medicare benefits schedule fee&mdash;$215 million in 1996 dollars added to the cost of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> private health insurance. They then withdrew their private hospital bed day subsidy&mdash;another $230 million added to the cost of private health insurance today. They then turned around and, as I said, politically kept saying to people, `You don't need it.' They forced expensive prostheses, like hip replacements, joint replacements, and so on, onto the basic table.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Everything they did was to push the cost of private health insurance up. It was government policy under Hawke, and then Keating, to increase the cost of private health insurance. Why did they want to do that? Because they are running a class war.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Talk about back to the future! The member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), who I notice was promoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Good Weekend</EMPHASIS> magazine recently as the next Labor Prime Minister, is continuing to run a class war. He is supposed to have been mentored by Gough Whitlam, who has many endearing qualities and a great intellect, of course. But here is the member for Werriwa describing my constituents, who carry themselves and half the country, as the enemy. That is what we do not need. And what we do not need in Australia, and what we certainly do not need in health, is a class war.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party at the 1996 election actually tore down the Berlin Wall. They had an inadequate policy but, nonetheless, a policy which recognised they would begrudgingly give some financial assistance to private health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the Labor Party has to do now is get behind the fact that we are providing financial assistance for low income people, who used to vote for the Labor Party. We are going to help them keep their private health insurance. We are changing the regulations under which the private health insurance industry works. And a part of that, a commonsense part of it, is to get Medibank Private out of Medicare offices and into the marketplace with the rest of the industry.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Over the past week in my electorate, around 700 players have successfully participated in the National Australian Football Super Rules Carnival. The carnival draws players from every state and territory in Australia, and is held over three match days in the carnival week. This year 28 teams have participated in the supers, masters and seniors divisions of the competition. To qualify to play, one has to be over 35 years of age, and there is no upper limit to the age of the participants. That would obviously qualify you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to pull the boots back on for the odd run, if you so desired.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a playing member of the Geelong Super Rules Club, I participated in two matches last Thursday and Sunday&mdash;and, of course, I am still sporting the bruises and the strains of those two competitive encounters against South Australia and the President's team. Those who play super rules and seek to extend their football life do so for many reasons. It is not only the desire to keep fit which motivates them but also their deep love of the game that now occupies a central and pre&hyphen;eminent place in the sporting culture of this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Super rules is very competitive. But those who play uphold the finest traditions and values of our Australian football code, and treasure the companionship and mateship of the super rules family, which not only includes the players but wives, children and friends as well. This year's carnival was sponsored by the Victorian Health Foundation, under their active for life program, as well as the Geelong <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS>, the Gordon Technical College and Bay City Plaza. I acknowledge the support of those sponsors as well as the City of Greater Geelong and the Geelong Football Club in bringing this national event to my electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is estimated that the event has brought 1,500 people to the Geelong region and has injected around $2 million into the local economy. The participants and their families have enjoyed not only the match days but also a range of activities which have included 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> family picnic days, golf days, social evenings and local tours. It is this community's social dimension which brings many participants back to the carnival each year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Each sport has members who not only are outstanding participants but are unselfish contributors to our great game in their later years. On Monday night at Kardinia Park in Geelong, National Super Rules inducted nine players into its Inaugural Hall of Fame. I would like to mention these players here tonight: Mick Morrow from Victorian Country, Doug Junior Jones from Queensland, Barry Edwards from Tasmania, Herman Rodding from the Northern Territory, Steve Eurell from New South Wales, Boyd Warrilow from Western Australia, Bill McDonald from South Australia; Tony Mathews from Victorian Metro, and Brian Sterling from the ACT. It is a well&hyphen;deserved award for those players, and I congratulate them and thank them for their magnificent contribution to Australian football down through the years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The carnival has been a resounding success. My congratulations must also go to the organising committee from Geelong Super Rules, who worked tirelessly to stage this event. To John Edsall, Brian Mewha, Laurie Evans, Mark McPherson, Peter Corkran, Charlie Adornetto, Ray Hocking and Tom Williams, may I express my thanks to you from all the players who were privileged to participate in this national sporting event. They were ably assisted by many people who did the one per centers plus that made the carnival tick over, such as organising time keepers, score board attendants and doing team sheets&mdash;people such as my longstanding friend Greg Finn, Tony Marinelli, Peter Marie and their legion of helpers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To the central boundary and goal umpires, a job well done and a special mention to Ed Ritchie, who typified the spirit of the carnival, who ran the boundary for four matches during one day and who, I believe, was still at it this afternoon when the teams were still playing.</PARA>

These two young people are in the gallery tonight and have each written a short speech about what they see as the future of the youth of today. James Field is in year 12 and a student at Wavell High School and Shannan Murphy is in year 11 and at Kedron High School. They were selected by their respective high schools to accompany me to Canberra, based on their scholastic achievements and the interest they have shown in the area of political studies. I would like to gratefully acknowledge the assistance of Ansett Airlines in flying the students to Canberra for this week's work experience and I would like to read the speeches they have written. James has said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The youth of today are the future of tomorrow. It is not until you stop and really think about this statement just how important a reality it is. We are the generation who will probably see more change in our life than any other. We are the generation who will make decisions about global warming, sustainable development and possibly rules governing Mars. We are entering an age of uncertainty where the only thing that is certain is change.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Luckily, we are a more educated generation in world affairs and in the moral and social issues affecting us all. This is probably why we feel dissatisfied at times because often our idealism is shattered with realism. Many youth will turn towards materialism out of frustration and feeling alienated. Many of us aspire at least to finish school, if not complete some tertiary education.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are taught not to always take things at face value but to be critically aware of the world. This may make us openly question traditionally held beliefs and appear to be just rebelling for the sake of rebelling, but what we are doing is expressing our view of ideal. We are often criticised for this view when what we are really doing is thinking, something youth should not be criticised for. If we are to tackle the major changes in our lifetime then we need to have an open mind and consider all possibilities. This is not to say we should not listen 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to the elders in our life. Some of these decisions we will make will have a great impact not only on ours, but on future generations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are faced with a life of great choice, incompatible to the past generations who have had their lives planned for them. We the youth should look at this choice as a positive in life and seize the opportunity, rather than seeing this choice as a constant pressure. We the youth are more concerned about the environment, we want to live with a better future, we dislike war and we tolerate our fellow human beings. We are the generation who would rather talk things through than fight them out.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The youth have a future ahead of them which will involve decisions on issues abroad and those concerning us at home. We will lead the world into an era of change within the 21st Century.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Shannon says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What do I want for and what do I want from my generation? Utopia. That's all. Actually, that's what I demand. Well, as perfection&mdash;and thus Utopia&mdash;are only ideals, what I want from my generation is a constant battle for Utopia, for without ideals nothing can ever improve.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Youth today has a bad name. We are labelled as dole bludging, substance abusing, society destroying no&hyphen;hopers, simply because we do not conform to the morals which some of the older generations wish to force upon us. We are different. We rebel and think differently&mdash;and this is what is necessary for the continual development of society. Without it Australia would stagnate. I hope to see, in the future, each generation's different morals, beliefs and ideals become an integral part of that generation's government, legal system and society. Think of racial equality, sexual equality and homosexuality. Fifty years ago these were unheard of and unacceptable and only now are they becoming socially acceptable and protected by the government. Still, sometimes they are not. Conservatists would tell us that these go against the very basis on which this nation was founded. The tradition. Tradition is only another word for fear of change.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Apathy helps no-one: not youth and not the people we are challenging. The best advice I can offer is, if you're going to complain&mdash;do it loudly. Protest. The right to protest is one of the basic principles of democracy. Why do you think it is the first right taken away by totalitarian regimes?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We want Utopia. Whether or not we ever achieve this doesn't matter. What is important is realising a perfect world starts within. By taking personal responsibility for changing things we don't like instead of wallowing in apathy we can achieve what we want. There is an ancient law&mdash;do what thou wilt but harm no-one.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to express my concern about matters relating to the publication of an article entitled `The art of shoplifting' in 1995 in the Latrobe University student newspaper <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rabelais</EMPHASIS> , which was edited by Michael Brown, Melita Berndt, Ben Ross and Valentina Srpcanska. My concern is that the four editors of this student newspaper are facing the prospect of criminal charges associated with the publication of this article. They are currently pursuing an appeal in the Federal Court with respect to the censorship code, seeking to overturn an initial decision in the Federal Court which did not offer them an absolute defence to criminal charges by ruling that the censorship code did not apply to the publication that they were involved with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my view, there is a fairly important issue of free speech involved in this issue. Obviously I do not condone the content of the article, but I think it is worth pointing out that the article is essentially a satirical one. It was also intended to make a political point about the living standards of many students who have to live in circumstances where they have very little money and therefore obviously the point was that shoplifting was a viable and necessary alternative because of their lack of funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, I do not condone that but there is a question here about where a line is drawn when the state is interfering in free speech, whether it is through the judicial system or whether it is through regulation. There are a number of examples that we could consider by way of analogy to see how difficult this becomes, including some of the things mentioned by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Lilley (Mrs Elizabeth Grace) in her contribution&mdash;articles, for example, about picketing where that may be in some ways illegal; articles describing how to use illicit drugs safely, including how to inject yourself safely; or indeed&mdash;and I note the honourable member for Menzies (Mr An 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> drews) is in the House tonight&mdash;articles about how to conduct euthanasia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although I, like the honourable member for Menzies, am an opponent of euthanasia, I certainly would not agree with the state intervening to prevent anybody from publishing an article saying, `This is how you can go about euthanasia.' Ultimately, as euthanasia involves death, I think we would all agree that it is a far more serious activity than shoplifting. So I would be interested to know the honourable member for Menzies' views on the matter that I have just raised, but I would hope that he would agree with me that, regardless of our views on euthanasia, we should not interfere with free speech in this way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, a serious incitement to major crime is something that should be a criminal offence. I think it is worth noting that I supported the former government's racial vilification legislation, which had in mind incitement to things like racial violence and the like as a criminal offence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am a former student newspaper editor and therefore I think I can say that people in the general community and in this House should not take student newspapers too seriously, particularly in this instance. As I have said, you have got a satirical point being made&mdash;a political point being made&mdash;and the response that has occurred is way over the top.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rabelais</EMPHASIS> article was wrong, but it was not that wrong that the state should intervene to ban it or to charge the publishers or the editors with criminal offences. It is indeed ironic that in 1992 the High Court determined that there was an implied right of free speech in the Australian constitution in the political advertising case. Paraphrasing Anatole France&mdash;who I think was the person responsible for the quote&mdash;the court decided that the poorest citizen and the most enormous multinational corporation both have equal rights to lodge political advertising on television.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is indeed peculiar that we can live in a society where the constitution holds that giant corporations have freedom of speech that cannot be interfered with by regulation of political advertising on TV but that students who write in a student newspaper satirical, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8395"> political material telling people this is how you go about shoplifting are susceptible to criminal charges and to their publication being banned. That seems to me to be an outrageous infringement of freedom of speech.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not condone the publication but I think it is a gross overreaction for the state to intervene in the way that it has. If freedom of speech is to be protected, it is absurd that things like bad taste, irresponsible satire and just plain silly articles should be the subject of criminal charges or direct government intervention. So I would hope that other members of this House would have a serious look at this issue because it does raise some serious questions about where censorship and freedom of speech may head in this country. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="8395"><TITLE>Citrus Industry</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, as you and most of the members of this House would be aware, the citrus industry, particularly in the Riverina, is going through an extremely tough time. Although for many years the industry has faced high and low points, the present low period has been brought about by a number of unfortunate circumstances all seeming to occur at the same time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The main problem is the present low world parity price for frozen concentrated orange juice brought about by a large quantity of Brazilian FCOJ being available on the world market. In the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area, because of environmental conditions this season, there has been a large overrun of small fruit that is only good for juicing and the crop, much of which could have been exported, has suffered severe frost damage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the past, governments would have been able to take corrective action to support the industry but, because of the previous government's action to have primary industry considered under the umbrella of the World Trade Organisation&mdash;the general thrust of which I do not criticise&mdash;the present government has very little room in which to manoeuvre if it does not wish to have penalties imposed on its other primary industry exports.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, it is difficult for growers in the Riverina to accept this situation when most are receiving $30 to $50 a tonne for their product, which takes $150 to produce. The reason for the $30 to $150 a tonne is the ever&hyphen;present threat of the Brazilian juice. Many are finding it difficult to survive and, while they are being told to diversify, it is common knowledge that it costs money to do this and, if they have small holdings, it is difficult to know what they are going to diversify into to make a living. If they are to replant other citrus varieties, it would take at least seven years for those trees to be fully productive and, due to the vagaries of the marketplace, they could no sooner change their orange varieties, or change to grapes or some other crop, when markets for these could also drop.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have made many representations on behalf of the Riverina citrus growers but the only answers I receive from government are those that my suggestions are not compatible with the World Trade Organisation parameters. After a great deal of thought, I believe one of the few areas of direct assistance that government can give is that of reducing or eliminating tax on pure orange juice&mdash;the same situation that applies to milk, which is also a food. I have been led to believe that removing the tax from fresh orange juice that is not made from concentrate would not be in compliance with World Trade Organisation regulations and therefore it would have to be removed from all 100 per cent fresh orange juice, whether Australian or imported.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The recent decision of the government to slow down the reduction of tariffs in the current textiles, clothing and footwear industries has caused dismay in the citrus industry, and growers believe they have been sacrificed on the World Trade Organisation altar in order to benefit other sectors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If every TCF worker is being subsidised, as is suggested, to the tune of $20,000 each per annum by the community, should assistance not be provided to citrus farmers, who work up to 12 or 15 hours a day, seven days a week? The citrus farmers are also Australians and believe they should be treated in the same way as other working Australians.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8396">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Presently, the government is proposing to provide funding to the Riverina region through a rural partnership program similar to the one already operating successfully in the Sunraysia and the Western Division of New South Wales. The program provides an opportunity for communities to put their collective knowledge, skills and experience together to deliver sustainable development in their regions. It aims to achieve: productive and professional farm business management that has the capacity to embrace climatic, economic and social change; sustainable natural resources and conservation management so that business and communities will be viable in the long term; robust and self&hyphen;sufficient communities with a reasonable level of services to support a good quality of life; and a local capacity for comprehensive, coordinated and community based planning into the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe the citrus industry has a tremendous future if we can just get over this short period when all these difficulties have come together. Its export trade is increasing, and that is the way the citrus industry is heading. I believe the quality of citrus in the Riverina is second to none, but we do have to get over this short difficult period. While not a cure, the rural partnership program will help.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Once again, the government has made Australia look out of place and out of step with the thinking of the rest of the world. This time the issue is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions where Australia's position is fundamentally at odds with the rest of the world. As well as irking the Americans and the Europeans, Australia has now beat up on and bullied into submission the Pacific Island nations, whose very existence is threatened by global warming.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) claims that the jury is still out on the scientific basis for the greenhouse effect and, therefore, it is not something to be taken seriously. I have 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> always maintained that it is possible to have a scientific debate about the nature and extent of climate change while, at the same time, undertaking measures to reduce greenhouse causing emissions. The planet simply cannot afford to wait until there is 100 per cent conclusive evidence either way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, the reduction in greenhouse gases has other significant environmental pluses. Air pollution as a consequence of greenhouse emissions can have as varied results as the decline in productivity of agricultural and forestry land to additional costs of cleaning, repair and maintenance of affected property. For example, the annual cost of pollution in terms of cleaning buildings has been estimated at around $13 million per annum in Sydney alone. This is all without even mentioning the costs to health and the health system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By decreasing reliance on fossil fuels, Australia would be encouraging alternative, renewable sources of energy and environmentally sustainable infrastructure and technology. Wind energy in California and in Denmark is at a level which is competitive with fossil fuels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are all reasons to get started on reducing greenhouse emissions now. The world did not wait for absolutely conclusive scientific evidence with regard to ozone depletion before chlorofluorocarbons were banned. Action was taken then, and action on climate change must be taken now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just look at the devastating scenes this week of street vendors selling schoolchildren face masks in Malaysia. Increasingly, experts in the field here in Australia are joining with their counterparts overseas in denouncing the Prime Minister's assertions on greenhouse as completely baseless.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>, Professor Peter Nixon, the director of Monash University's Centre for Policy Studies, said that the Prime Minister's claim&mdash;made in question time yesterday&mdash;that 90,000 jobs would be lost if Australia agreed to the greenhouse targets would not be supported by any economic model that he was aware of. The truth is that, while the Prime Minister bemoans what might happen based on his unsubstantiated views, as the honour 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="8397"> able member for Denison (Mr Kerr) has indicated, 60,000 real full&hyphen;time jobs have been lost in the past year. These are 60,000 real, existing jobs&mdash;not the Prime Minister's baseless assertions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The costs of failing to prevent the degradation of the environment are completely ignored by the government. One European Union study has estimated that global warming costs the national income 1.6 per cent for each degree of warming. Furthermore, a study by Bent Sorensen, published this year, estimates that the external costs of expected climate change, taken over the whole of the 21st century, is about $US10,000 billion each year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the government claims that greenhouse emission reductions cost jobs, the truth is that environmental policies have the potential for major employment benefits. In 1994 the environment industry in the United States was responsible for providing more than one million jobs. In addition to this, the number was growing at twice the rate of total employment overall. Decreasing reliance on non&hyphen;renewable sources of energy means a shift towards a sustainable economy relying more on building human skills and less on consuming energy and resources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">State of the environment</EMPHASIS> report released last year&mdash;which the government tried to bury&mdash;states that an inventory of greenhouse gas emissions in Australia suggests that land clearance may be contributing up to 20 per cent of total greenhouse emissions; yet the government continues to allow the clearing of native vegetation at a rate of 600,000 hectares per year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a myth that environmental degradation affects everyone equally, rich and poor alike. This is not correct. If no action is taken now, protection from and adaptation to climate change will be costly for individuals. When the individual has to meet these costs, the wealthy will be insulated from the effects more so than the poor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister speaks about a differential greenhouse target for Australia as if we did not live in the same global environment as everyone else. As the British Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, said, Australians' 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> grandchildren are just as affected by climate change as everyone else's. Failure to act now will result in a greater inequity imposed on future generations.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="8397"><TITLE>British Telecom</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In recent weeks and months the financial press has carried reports of a proposed merger between British Telecom and MCI Communications Corporation, an American company, to form what is being described as one of the largest, if not the largest, telecommunications companies in the world. A recent report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  said: `BT and MCI officials insisted that breaking into the recently deregulated $US100 billion local phone market in the United States remained a strategic priority for them.' Given this statement, it is worth while looking at the track record of BT in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">BT formed BT Australasia Pty Ltd, which I will refer to as BTA, in 1987 as a wholly owned subsidiary. In November 1992 BTA successfully tendered to the New South Wales government to design, build and operate a new digital telecommunications network for the government. BTA then established Sydney as its Asia&hyphen;Pacific regional headquarters and committed to a range of investment and other procurement and development projects. In early 1994, BTA decided that it should become a preferred supplier of telecommunications services to the Australian business community. It proposed to capture this market through the sale and provision of its Option 6 and Option 8 products. It appointed another company to market these products and to obtain, with its assistance, the endorsement of approximately 40 employer associations and other buying groups, including the Victorian Employers Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia, the Metal Trades Industry Association and the Australian Hotels Association.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Option 8 offered to provide organisations and their members with Telstra and Optus services at a significant discount and to provide them with a comprehensive range of additional benefits and services. BTA also offered to pay these organisations royalty and sponsorship payments based on the volume of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8398"> business they and their members and customers provided to BTA. After careful consideration, a number of organisations accepted the submission because its telecommunications services offer was competitive and comprehensive. Organisations which accepted the Option 8 offer and signed an agreement with BTA then publicly endorsed BTA's offer to their members and customers by letters and mail&hyphen;outs. BTA authorised, printed and distributed brochures throughout Australia to approximately 60,000 businesses and, as a result, approximately 8,000 businesses assigned their telecommunications services to BTA. This business totalled $138 million per year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">BTA did not provide the discounts and services to its customers which were obtained by marketing through these organisations. The discounts and services that BTA represented and contracted to provide formed the basis of these organisations' acceptance of BTA's Option 8 offer. Further, I am advised that BTA did not pay the royalty and sponsorship payments to the organisations with which it had agreements. In fact, I am advised that BTA unilaterally cancelled its five-year agreements with these organisations after 12 to 18 months. It unilaterally cancelled its provision of telecommunications services to these organisations and to the customers they introduced to BTA and then transferred the remainder of these customers' accounts to Telstra for an undisclosed fee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prior to this massive national endorsement, British Telecom and BTA were largely unheard of in Australia by the business community. In July 1995, BTA cancelled the New South Wales government contract and sued the New South Wales government and Telstra. I am advised that BTA did not fulfil a vast majority of its commitments to its customers. BTA continued to offer its products and accept orders for these products with the full knowledge that it was not providing its customers with offered discounts and other services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also evidence that, from about October 1995, BTA did not intend to provide these discounts and services and that it continued to offer its products, knowing that it 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> was not fulfilling its obligations, until September 1996 when it unilaterally withdrew from the market. It then cancelled its services and sold the customer base, as I said, to Telstra. After this it employed debt collecting techniques with small business customers that had signed up. None of these customers had received the benefits or all of the benefits that BTA offered them, nor were they able to defend themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In light of this, a complaint was made to the ACCC in July 1996 and I believe this has been supported by a number of business organisations, including the Victorian Employers Chamber of Commerce and Industry. I urge the ACCC to look at this matter in great detail and I also bring this to the attention of the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith).</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="8398"><TITLE>Hearing Test Companies</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to also pick up the theme of products that are advertised and services that are not delivered. In this case it involves hearing test companies which telephone canvass people, and offer them free hearing tests and the prospect of compensation from their former employers for hearing loss. As a result of a campaign that I and others have been waging against these companies, we have seen legislation introduced in Victoria&mdash;and indeed there has been legislation in New South Wales&mdash;which disallows touting for claimants by agents in relation to claims for industrial hearing loss compensation. Following the passage of that legislation, a couple of companies went out of business. That also had quite a lot to do with the fact that many claims had been lodged against these companies, EarCare and BetterCare, in Victoria's Small Claims Tribunal by the many people who had been ripped off for sums of money like $250 and $400, which they had paid but for which they had received nothing in return.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently I followed up with the Victorian WorkCover Authority some aspects of the shutting down of these operations. I am disturbed by the response I received, which confirmed some of the fears that I have held. From the Chief Executive of the WorkCover Authority just yesterday I received advice 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8399"> that, although BetterCare had closed down, at its former place of operation, in my own electorate in Sydney Road, we now find a new company established: National Hearing Centres Pty Ltd. At the same address is the law firm of Anders Salwin and Salwin. As the Victorian WorkCover Authority points out to me, Mr Mark Anders Salwin, a solicitor, is the common factor among these three particular entities. The chief executive says that the law firm of Anders Salwin and Salwin is currently engaging in telephone canvassing within Victoria for hearing loss compensation claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would urge any Victorians and people who are contacted by agents or representatives of Anders Salwin and Salwin to take a good hard look before they attend meetings to discuss their hearing loss because, if their experience is anything like that of others who have been to BetterCare before them, they will be ripped off and will not get any hearing loss compensation whatsoever. I also encourage people in South Australia who are contacted by representatives of such companies and, in particular, BetterCare to avoid these people like the plague. The letter from the Victorian WorkCover Authority to me says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The introduction of hearing loss entrepreneurs to South Australia is not surprising, given that State is yet to introduce controlling legislation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It goes on to note that the workers compensation authority in that state is currently drafting legislative remedies in line with the New South Wales and Victorian statutes. In the meantime I would urge South Australians not to part with their hard&hyphen;earned cash in response to overtures by BetterCare or other similar</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset, I would indicate to the committee that the opposition does not oppose this package of measures that have been introduced by the government. There are two packages, as you have rightly pointed out. One is more generally described as the fuel substitution package and the second is a couple of pieces of legislation flowing from that, but also tied in to the issue that was debated in this place during the last sitting weeks in response to the decision handed down by the High Court on the collection of excise as a result of a challenge launched in New South Wales.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a consequence, the decisions taken by the government in implementing the fuel issue here, the substitution matter in the parliament today with the package of bills, is something which necessitated further changes. As I have indicated, the opposition will not stand in the way of the passage of that legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that the government also is proposing to introduce some amendments. We have had the opportunity provided and afforded by the minister's office for a briefing on that. The opposition has no difficulty with any of those matters that come before us today. As government amendments, they are technical amendments and nothing more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One or two things need to be said though, particularly about the fuel substitution package. The measures that are to be set out in this legislation will implement the government's budget decision to combat revenue lost through the minimisation of fuel substitution and to improve 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8401"> compliance in the payment of customs and excise duty. The measures will provide for the addition of chemical markers to concessional petroleum products. They will impose penalties for the use of marked products and sale of marked products for use as internal combustion engine fuels and for the blending of marked and unmarked products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some enhanced record keeping requirements to be imposed now. These will enable the officers of the Australian Customs Service to look at the way in which some of these blended fuels are put onto the market. This concept of a chemical marker being used within the fuel to give a better understanding for customs officers when carrying out their inspections is a worthwhile advance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would just draw to the government's attention some concerns that have been raised with me. I am sure the officers of the Australian Customs Service that are here will take these on board. The Oil Recyclers Association of Australia, for example, have written to me and suggested that they have no problem with the way in which untreated oils are being used for diesel and as fuel. The blending proposal that is contained here is not in question, but they are concerned about the approach being taken for processed used oil.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure these issues have been drawn to the attention also of the minister. I just raise them in the debate today so that those issues might be addressed at some time in the future, perhaps by the minister in his response in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly the Arafura Group have written to, I suspect, all members of the House. This came indirectly to me from my colleague the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans), in respect of these matters. They are concerned about the decreased profitability that might occur as a result of some of the impositions now being placed on companies in respect of the changes that will be necessary with the passage of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Arafura Group believe that they are struggling in a highly competitive and diminishing marketplace, competing with aggressively marketed and subsidised natural gas. They believe that this package should be rejected because it is anti&hyphen;competitive and perhaps not protecting the local industry. Again I raise these as issues which the minister may like to review and make some comment on when this matter comes before the Senate for passage in that place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The basis of this legislation is the government seeking to ensure that there is no substitution of fuel, that in some way a penalty might be imposed, and that a chemical marker is put in so that the Customs Service can examine the way in which reprocessed fuels and so on are used and perhaps blended. I think it is an interesting approach taken by the Customs Service as representing the government of this nation, because it is endeavouring to stop rorts in the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an attempt to stop people substituting environmentally degraded products in fuels and therefore causing environmental problems. It is an attempt to say that if people do the wrong thing, then, by having an appropriate chemical marker in place, the government's officials will be able to determine this and, as a consequence, a penalty can be imposed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot help but think how this stands in stark contrast to the rorts that we have seen perpetrated and explained in this parliament last night&mdash;I think `explained' is probably too narrow a word. I want to compare what the government is seeking to do here with the cover&hyphen;up that has been undertaken by a minister of the Crown in this place in respect of travel rorts being perpetrated&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps you are right that at the outset the amendment should not have been accepted. But it was. It was allowed to be debated and then suddenly it was thrown out. It was quite an extraordinary set of events in this place last night but it was certainly in keeping with the way in which the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) in the House of Representatives runs his parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Coming back to the legislation, however, when we talk about fuel substitution legislation and the rorts that this is endeavouring to stamp out, again one cannot help but draw a comparison in other areas. What happens, for example, if people in a consumer situation are in some way able to substitute receipts or whatever? The Australian Taxation Office will immediately come in and say, `That's rorting the system and we are going to impose a penalty on you.' There can be monetary penalties. There can be penalties of imprisonment and a whole range of other penalties if you try and cheat the system. Amazingly, here we have a government that says it is committed to trying to stop people using fuel substitution to put in low&hyphen;quality, low&hyphen;grade, reused oil and oil products to blend to get a better outcome and yet when we try to talk about a comparison in other parts of the administration of this government, we find that that is squeaky clean. We find that ministers can in fact put in bogus claims, redress them, and have some secret deal done. Suddenly we find that the minister responsible for that tables the information in the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a consequence, that substitution of pieces of information in the House of Representatives can be equated to the fuel substitution package that we are debating here today. I have to say again that you could look at this package of legislation dealing with fuel substitution or you could look at the issue of customs and excise and the two bills that subsequently flowed because of a High Court decision. Again, it is amazing how the courts are brought into this when people believe that moneys have been incorrectly taken from them, as was the case in the liquor industry in New South Wales when they sought to have that money returned to the people of New South Wales. A High Court decision was necessary to enable that to happen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8404">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a bit like, I suppose, the government or the prime minister of the day deciding to set up an inquiry into an allegation of a rort somewhere. It is a bit like our present Prime Minister (Mr Howard) deciding to have an investigation into allegations that someone tried to make last night and will subsequently be proven. To some extent, we saw a lot of reporting on the issue in the High Court in this decision about the excise issue associated with petrol and tobacco products in Australia. We saw a lot of reporting which in fact kicked off this latest allegation that someone has tried to raise in the House of Representatives last night about a substitution issue similar to that of the fuel substitution legislation that we are debating now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite honestly, there is the fact of how people in this country today regard people who try to rort the system, whether it be by substituting fuel products or whether it be by blending fuels with low&hyphen;grade products so that the emissions that come from cars pollute the atmosphere. It is very similar to the sorts of concerns that more generally the public have about people in public office, and the respect which they seem to find lacking in them, because of things that are supposedly happening, which are being reported in articles such as that by Laurie Oakes in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> today. I am sure we will see it in other newspaper articles and other commentary. We saw it on television this morning with Laurie Oakes and on television last night with Paul Lyneham.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These sorts of issues go to the heart of why governments bring in legislation to protect consumers. They go to the heart of why governments want to protect the revenue base. It is a bit like the situation in the House of Representatives and the Senate at the minute where this government has felt it necessary to bring in private consultants, KPMG, to marry travel claims from members of parliament with the actual records that they themselves have kept with other records that were there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been here for nearly 13 years, and I thought&mdash;probably like you, Mr Deputy Speaker&mdash;that when we travelled down here for parliament or when we travelled for parliamentary committee work the records of our travel with Ansett or Qantas, or whatever, were held, that the TA payments that we claimed were held and that our Comcar bookings were held. And silly me, like you, thought that at the end of the month someone sat down and married all of those together.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apparently that has not been the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, from a public perspective, the opportunity is there, as is the case with fuel substitution, to make some errors, as has been claimed by some in this place as recently as last night, and to look at ways in which perhaps a more systematic opportunity might exist. It can again be relevant to somebody who, through the acquisition of low&hyphen;grade oil products, systematically looks at ways in which they can substitute that and blend it with other material so that it can then be retailed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The consequence of that is that people suffer when their car plays up. There is also the consequence of environmental pollution, particularly in the major cities of Australia, the large car&hyphen;using areas. The same issue can be brought to bear here where people take advantage of positions of influence because they have an opportunity, in their own way, to make claims for things and to try to see the ways in which, as with the case of fuel substitution, they will not get caught until somebody says, `Hang on! We had better substitute what is already there.' That is exactly what seems to have happened in respect of this matter&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, these particular bills, the Excise Tariff (Fuel Rates Amendments) Bill 1997 , the Customs Tariff (Fuel Rates Amendments) Bill 1997 , the Fuel Misuse (Penalty Surcharge) Bill 1997 , the Fuel Sale (Penalty Surcharge) Bill 1997 , the Fuel Blending (Penalty Surcharge) Bill 1997 , and the  Fuel (Penalty Surcharges) Administration Bill 1997 &hyphen; and not to forget the  Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997 , the  Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1997 and the  Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1997 are all concerned about the same issue. They are concerned about redressing a revenue problem for this government. They are concerned about the situation where people in some way rort the system as it applies to fuel substitution. It is concerned that there are penalties imposed on people and that when they are caught there is redress.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is hoped that in all circumstances&mdash;whether it be abuse in fuel substitution; the need for further legislation arising out of the customs area; rorts perpetrated through the Australian Taxation Office; people trying to rip off the system in a more generic way by failing to properly adhere to standards, to proper concerns that are raised more broadly in the community&mdash;when those sorts of cases are discovered and people understand that they happen and the redress that will come through legislation like this is applied, those people are penalised. They must be penalised not only through the legislation, such as the penalty surcharge bill when we are talking about fuel, but it must be the case more generally, if they are caught and those penalties are applied, that there is no cover&hyphen;up by anyone and that that matter is thoroughly investigated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once again I indicate to the Main Committee that the opposition does not oppose the fuel legislation package. We do not oppose the customs bills that are relevant to this matter. We will not oppose the government amendments that have been drafted to pick up and correct some technical aspects of the legislation. We are very grateful that the government has allowed this legislation to be debated in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We hope that the same concern that this government has for ensuring that&mdash;where there are problems with rorts in the system, such as in fuel substitution and in the imposition of penalties&mdash;if legislation of this nature can be debated here, any opportunity where clearly there is a hint&mdash;in fact probably more than a hint&mdash;of impropriety taking place, whether it be at the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8406"> highest levels of government or elsewhere, the opportunities of this parliament are not thwarted in an honest attempt by an opposition to raise them in an appropriate way.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to address this rather complex set of bills brought about in part by the decision of the High Court in Ha and Lim and also the Walter Hammond case in New South Wales. Both of those cases took away the ability of states to impose franchise fees on various items which raised a substantial amount of revenue for the states, and subsequently that revenue had to be urgently replaced by the Commonwealth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A series of bills went through this House on 28 August. They were introduced into this House on that date but they were to operate with effect from 5 August in order to deal with that crisis that arose in terms of state and Commonwealth funding. Prior to the introduction of those bills&mdash;in fact on 25 June&mdash;the  Excise Tariff (Fuel Rates Amendments) Bill 1997 , the  Customs Tariff (Fuel Rates Amendments) Bill 1997 , the  Fuel Misuse (Penalty Surcharge) Bill 1997 , the  Fuel Sale (Penalty Surcharge) Bill 1997 , the Fuel Blending (Penalty Surcharge) Bill 1997 , the  Fuel Blending (Penalty Surcharge) Bill 1997 , the  Fuel (Penalty Surcharges) Administration Bill 1997  and the  Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997  had been introduced into this House to make provision for an additive to be placed in fuels which were sold for non&hyphen;transport uses and attracted an excise of 7.2c per litre.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You can see the obvious advantage in bringing fuels of that kind into the country, paying 7.2c per litre, blending them later and selling them on as fuels intended for on&hyphen;road use for which the excise duty is 34.697c per litre. It is very difficult to distinguish those fuels&mdash;things like kerosene have other uses&mdash;and they can be easily mixed up and put into uses for which excise has not been paid. That makes the prosecution of anyone avoiding tax extremely difficult. In fact, the department estimated that $25 million a year was lost in uncollected excise duties through people paying duty of 7c per litre rather than 34c per litre.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an area that is very difficult to prosecute, whereas a dye or a colourless marker, which is already successful is some European countries, can be added to fuel. This makes the prosecution of people found using, selling or illegally blending fuels for on&hyphen;road use that much easier in the courts; the standard of proof required then is easy to jump over. Exactly what that dye or blend is going to be is, as yet, undecided. It has been left to the Institute of Petroleum, state revenue offices and motoring consumer organisations to come up with what the additives will be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a very interesting concept in terms of the amount of money estimated as being lost. Some estimates since then have been twice that amount. However, the implementation costs have been estimated at something like $5.97 million over four years, with additional running costs of $1.54 million after that. A cost&hyphen;risk analysis has been done. It seems that the government's estimate of 0.004c per litre is being disputed by the industry, which reckons that the cost will be 0.15c per litre. No doubt this will be passed on to users so we may see a slight rise in off&hyphen;road fuel costs due to the requirement for an additive. However, given that most petrol companies only allow fuel stations to make a cent a litre anyway, in this instance it may well serve the industry to absorb that cost itself because there is quite a head of steam building up with operators and franchisees of petrol stations about their profitability and their ability to trade in today's fuel distribution environment.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8407">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an issue that has arisen recently in my electorate and it is of great concern. We constantly require our distributors and station operators to apply these laws. Often it seems that the consumers, or the operators themselves, pay the price. That is a concern that I will raise on behalf of the station operators in my electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other issue involved in the 34c per litre charge for on&hyphen;road fuel consumption is that it is a disincentive for people to use their cars. I applaud that. I would like to see more people taking advantage of public transport. I live in outer western Sydney. We have a very serious air pollution problem, which the city car users can only address by not using their cars in such an avid fashion, probably by car pooling&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Recently, I noticed in one article that some time in the next millennium Mercedes is looking at introducing a new car the size of a Barina. It would retail at around $40,000, and apparently run on hydrogen with no emissions. So, again, with new technology catching up with us, we will no doubt see another rash of bills coming through. I hope that there is an encouragement to use this type of technology, rather than continuing with the fuel emissions that we currently have resulting in the terrible problems we have in Sydney, especially, with car and truck petrol and diesel emission pollution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We ended up having to have the remaining two bills, the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1997 and the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1997, introduced to go through with this package to overcome the situation where these bills, which were introduced on 25 June, introducing new excise levels, would not then negate what actually occurred in the August set of bills which addressed that High Court decision where the funds wilted away. So, to avoid the set of bills reducing the actual excise levels which were set down in that previous legislation, these two amendment bills have to be passed concurrently so that in fact the excise levels stay where they are and revenue levels are maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it has been a rather interesting package of bills. It has some minor drafting inconsistencies which are being fixed up in the latter bills, and a number of technical amendments to the schedule, but they basically do not alter the financial impact of the entire package of bills that was passed in August, and which we are discussing today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I notice that it does not have any dissent from the opposition. They had discussed this addition of additives as early as 1993 when they passed some earlier legislation to make it easier for the Australian Customs Service to determine when people were not complying. It has been a difficult legal problem to solve with the standards of proof that Australia requires before someone is convicted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Australia we do not, as a rule, convict people out of hand on aspersion without actually giving them the opportunity to give their side of the story, or to put the facts as known to them before a properly appointed judicial court for consideration. An incredibly high standard of proof is required before we proclaim to the world that people are guilty of any misdemeanour beyond reasonable doubt. These fuel additives will make sure that that standard of proof is able to be met by the Customs authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Relative to a few comments made earlier in this chamber, I think that it does well for the opposition to bear in mind those standards of proof and our Australian judicial system and standards of behaviour, even in parliament where we are covered by parliamentary privilege, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8408"> and to extend to people the courtesy of at least a trial before they are convicted beyond reasonable doubt in the media or in parliament. Thank you.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The bill that is before the House is non&hyphen;controversial in the sense that it is supported by the opposition. And, of course, it is an appropriate bill to support because it is stopping a rort costing revenue some estimated $25 million a year through illegal blending and substitution of petroleum products. It is highly appropriate that the government moves to take action in an effective way against such bleeding of the tax revenue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also note that in the budget the government has also provided additional resources to the Customs Service to enable it to monitor the scheme, to investigate where fuel substitution is suspected and to take necessary action against offenders. That is very much supported by the opposition in order to make sure that the scheme is effective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to protect the revenue in this area because this is a major revenue earner. This is an area where the government raises some $10&frac34;billion a year, in gross terms. That is the total revenue for fuel tax. If one takes account of the diesel fuel rebate of that tax revenue, then the net revenue raised is some $9.3 billion. It represents over eight per cent of total tax revenue raised and it is a very important element of the total revenue raising by the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is therefore interesting, in that context, that we have calls for the abolition of fuel tax coming from within the government. That is a serious issue indeed, particularly given where it is coming from&mdash;not from just a backbencher, but from a member of the ministry. In fact, it is the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) who has been calling for the abolition of fuel tax in the context of tax reform&mdash;a euphemism for the introduction of a goods and services tax. In that context, he is saying that what must be done is to pursue the same attitude towards fuel tax as was in the Fightback package of 1993, which involved the abolition of fuel tax and the imposition of a goods and services tax on fuel but nothing else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To prove that, I note that in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 16 June an article headed `Fischer fails to rule out tax increase' says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">He&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is, the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Fischer&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">presented strong support for a goods and services tax, as well as reaffirming his support for scrapping petrol excise.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Later on, the article quotes him from the Seven Network's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Face to Face</EMPHASIS>  program when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"But, above all else, we want to see those transport fuel taxes taken out of the system and, in fact, replaced by a rebatable form of value&hyphen;added tax, goods and services tax."</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Similar quotes were also contained in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>  about a month later, where he repeated the call.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So in this important area of fuel tax, where we are trying to protect the revenue in this legislation, what we have is the Deputy Prime Minister calling for the abolition of this total means of raising tax. This needs some examination, because we do have a low level of overall fuel tax in Australia at the present time and, therefore, low fuel prices. The International Energy Agency, which is a body to which Australia belongs and whose members are 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8409"> essentially most of the members of the OECD, did a review in 1997 of Australia's energy policies. In that report it said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Due to lower consumption taxes than in other IEA countries, post tax retail prices on automotive fuels in Australia are generally lower than those in other IEA countries.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What it is saying is that we have low consumption taxes on fuel and, therefore, we have low overall fuel prices. It goes on to give examples: Japan is more than double us; the UK is much higher; New Zealand is a little higher; and Canada and the USA are lower&mdash;but they are the lowest in the developed world by a long way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a context where Australia already has relatively low automotive fuel taxes and, therefore, relatively low automotive fuel prices, we have the Deputy Prime Minister of this country and his party advocating making our fuel taxes and prices much lower. How much lower would they go? This point has been analysed by an authoritative source. It is the Department of Transport and Regional Development. In a discussion paper entitled `Implications of a goods and services tax on Commonwealth road funding arrangements' the department said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently fuel excise rates are 34.6 cents per litre (cpl) on diesel and unleaded petrol and 36.7 cpl leaded petrol. Under a 15% GST&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">which was the rate in Fightback&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the effective tax rate would reduce to around 3.2 cpl&hyphen;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">as against 34.6 for unleaded petrol&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to over 8 cpl . . . depending on State and location.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So you are reduced to around 3.2c per litre in the capital cities and up to eight per cent in other areas, depending on the retail price. We can see that this involves a drastic reduction, an enormous reduction, in taxes on fuel. On the department's figures it would mean a cut of at least 31.4 cents per litre for diesel and unleaded petrol in capital cities. This in turn would mean much lower fuel prices. In this regard, the department said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian motorists already pay less for their fuel than most other developed countries, significantly so in many cases. Only in the USA . . . and Canada is fuel cheaper to buy. The abolition of the fuel excise, replaced by a GST only tax, would reduce the (current) Sydney price per litre from around 70 cents per litre to around 40 cents for private consumption use, or 35 cents for business users.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We are talking about, in broad terms, a reduction from 70c to 40c&mdash;an extraordinary reduction of over 40 per cent, which the Deputy Prime Minister, and presumably his party, are strongly advocating within the government, and doing publicly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The calculation of reductions of that order assumes that the state franchise fees would remain. As we know, as a result of the High Court decision the Commonwealth is now faced with having to levy excise to make up for the fact that the franchise fees are apparently unconstitutional. So the figuring that has been done in the departmental article assumes&mdash;in fact it was written before the High Court decision&mdash;that the state franchise fees apply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If, of course, the tax were taken through so that all of the excise currently being raised by the Commonwealth on behalf of the states was also abolished, the reduction in fuel prices would be even greater than the department is stating in its comments. It is interesting to see what the department concluded about this outcome. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The abolition of the fuel excise would lead to Australia having the lowest tax on fuel of all developed countries.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I repeat: `of all developed countries'. It then went on:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8410">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A reduction in fuel prices of this order would impact on Australia's credibility in the international arena. Australia is already under international criticism for not meeting its obligations under agreements covering greenhouse gas emissions.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And well might it say that, because it would make Australia an international pariah regarding the issue of greenhouse gas and climate warming, because we would clearly be taking action to increase considerably our emissions of greenhouse gases and not to reduce them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What would be the effect on greenhouse gas emissions in Australia if this policy were to be pursued? There can be no doubt that such a policy would cause increased emissions of greenhouse gases in Australia. If car and truck fuel prices fall by over 40 per cent, who could doubt that there would be much higher use of automotive vehicles, with much higher greenhouse gas emissions coming from this source?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia already has a high level of greenhouse gas emission. We are about the 16th largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world, even though we produce only around 1.5 per cent of all greenhouse gases. In per capita terms, we are very high. The International Energy Agency, in its 1997 Australia review, in regard to energy related carbon dioxide emissions, says that Australia was the eighth largest emitter in 1994, the second largest emitter per capita after the United States and the second largest emitter per unit of GDP after Greece. The IEA was talking about energy related carbon dioxide emissions. So it can be seen that in per capita terms we are a high emitter of greenhouse gases from the energy source and, indeed, overall.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Narrowing the energy sector down to the transport sector, the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics 1996 report on transport and greenhouse shows that, although transport is responsible for only 12 per cent of Australia's greenhouse gas emissions, on a per capita basis we are the third highest emitter of carbon dioxide, with only Canada and the United States, which have at present much lower fuel prices than ours, being higher than us on per capita carbon dioxide emissions. So Australia has emissions of 3.84 tonnes per capita. It was 16 per cent above the OECD average and over 4&half; times the world average per capita. Although that would be partly attributable to distance factors in Australia, we nevertheless have a poor record on fuel efficient cars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The International Energy Agency says that our average fuel consumption per passenger car of 8.9 litres per 100 kilometres is significantly higher than the IEA average and that we are the third highest after the United States and Canada. Australia is already at the very upper end of per capita greenhouse gas emissions from its transport sector. Certainly, the United States of America at 6.11 tonnes per capita and Canada at 5.46 tonnes per capita are way above us. But if, as the Deputy Prime Minister is proposing, we cut our fuel prices to near the levels that prevail in Canada and the United States, we can expect that our greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector will rapidly accelerate towards the levels of these extravagant user countries through increased use of vehicles and reduced incentives to increase fuel efficiency of our cars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What would be the effect of this on Australia's international standing if a policy such as that which the Deputy Prime Minister is advocating was to be followed through? I must say that at any time to be advocating a policy of this kind, which encourages wasteful use of a scarce non&hyphen;renewable resource, increases pollution and traffic congestion in our cities, and adds to greenhouse emissions and the global warming problem, would be utterly irresponsible. To be advocating it now in the current context of Australia already battling to get any support for its policy on greenhouse gas emission targets for the first decade of the next century is sheer madness.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the third conference of the parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change&mdash;to be held in Kyoto in December of this year&mdash;draws near, Australia's policy of wanting differentiated greenhouse gas emission targets based on the concept of an equal degree of economic hurt to all in annex 1 countries&mdash;which are basically the OECD countries and eastern Europe&mdash;seems to have precious few, if any, supporters. Japan was said by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to be sympathetic, but it is now advocating a uniform reduction target, not a differentiated one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister came back from the United States feeling chuffed about his reception on the greenhouse gas issue, but President Clinton and his advisers have since indicated support for a uniform target. President Clinton's key adviser on this issue said he did not understand the Australian argument. That is Mr Tim Worth, the US Undersecretary for Global Affairs. He said he just did not understand what Australia was talking about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We saw last week at the South Pacific Forum in the Cook Islands how isolated Australia was: 15 to one was the generally accepted position. Even New Zealand was against us, and that is particularly significant because the modelling by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics on the economic impact of uniform reduction targets for greenhouse gas emissions shows that New Zealand is more adversely affected than Australia by the imposition of uniform targets. But are they adopting the same position as Australia? No, they are not. They are not giving us one ounce of support in the international argument on this issue. They are lined up with those who are calling for binding emission reduction targets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia is in the position where it is the only industrialised country refusing to support binding emission reduction targets. We are saying we will sign up to some target, but it has to be an increase. Everyone else is saying they will sign up to a reduction target. We are one of only a few countries that are not supporting a uniform reduction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia's international standing is increasingly being brought into question because of this issue. Just imagine what it will be like when the rest of the world learns that this government is contemplating a massive reduction in fuel taxes and prices and so encouraging greatly increased emission of greenhouse gases. Any chance of anyone listening to Australia's argument will be utterly and completely lost. We will be seen as utterly selfish and irresponsible and risk becoming a complete international pariah.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even the Department of Transport and Regional Development pointed out what a problem it would be for us in relation to the international arena.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our credibility on this issue has been dealt a grievous blow, in addition to these statements, by our cuts to energy efficiency and energy research programs in this year's budget, which reduced funding to the national energy efficiency program by $11 million after a $3 million cut the previous year and wound up the Energy Research and Development Corporation to save $37 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is cutting funds in this crucial area of energy efficiency and development of energy alternatives by $50 million and then going to the rest of the world and saying, `Hey, we need a special case to cover us because we have got such a problem with greenhouse gases.' They might rightly say, `Well, what are you doing about it?' And we say, `We're cutting expenditure in this area.' Terrific! What a great argument! What a message it sends about our concern to reduce greenhouse gas emissions which, per capita, are amongst the highest in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But as important as these cuts are, they are minor compared to the reaction that we could expect to a government policy to slash automotive fuel taxes and prices. To be advocating this 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8412"> now, in the lead&hyphen;up to Kyoto, invites scorn and derision from the rest of the world rather than the serious consideration of arguments that the government is trying to put to other countries. How can a country possibly look as though it is concerned about the overall issue of global warming and be taken seriously when it says that it just wants to be treated fairly when it is simultaneously considering action that would substantially increase its greenhouse gas emissions? To have any chance of being taken seriously, Australia has to be seen to be doing as much as it reasonably can to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. Clearly, the Deputy Prime Minister's tax policy does not fit into that category.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the Prime Minister wants to save Australia from international humiliation and scorn, he must repudiate his Deputy Prime Minister&mdash;and he must do it immediately. He must declare forthwith that Australia is not going to slash its fuel taxes and prices and, for good measure, he should also restore the budget cuts in the energy efficiency research area and seriously consider at least some of the other policies that would help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, such as those which are set out in the International Energy Agency report on Australia&mdash;which I have not got time to go into.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He should also of course be looking very closely at the policy on land clearance, which, in Australia's case, accounts for an enormous percentage of our greenhouse gas emissions. Twenty&hyphen;three per cent of our greenhouse gas emissions come from land clearance&mdash;23 per cent as against 12 per cent from the transport sector&mdash;and most of this is occurring in Queensland. We are clearing&mdash;can you believe it?&mdash;660,000 hectares per annum. This is almost Amazonian in its rate of clearance, and most of that&mdash;450,000&mdash;is in Queensland. Most of it involves the clearance of broadacre native vegetation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is boasting about its Natural Heritage Trust and its national vegetation initiative, but that will not be effective if we allow the continuance of this extraordinary rate of clearance, which is boosting our greenhouse gas emissions and making us look insincere and unconcerned about greenhouse gas emissions at the same time as we are trying to persuade the rest of the world as to how concerned we are about it and why we need special treatment. They would rightly say to us, `Get your own house in order first; then come back to us with arguments for special treatment,' particularly in the context where the Deputy Prime Minister is arguing for a policy which is irresponsible in the extreme on any front, and particularly in the context of our moving towards the Kyoto conference.</PARA></SPEECH>

It might be easy for the member for Gellibrand who has small distances to travel in his city of Melbourne. I do not know whether the member for Gellibrand understands the transport needs of this country and the needs to keep the costs down.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In speaking to this series of legislation today, I would firstly like to deal with some of the taxation reform issues associated with the  Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1997 . On 5 August, the High Court made a decision invalidating New South Wales tobacco business franchise fees. The decision also effectively struck off the states' and territories' abilities to collect fees and excise charges on tobacco, fuel and alcohol. I think that we all know the story, so I will not dwell on that too long.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The federal government initiated a rescue package or a safety net provision whereby the government would collect the state and territory charges on their behalf. The High Court decision was certainly a factor in re&hyphen;sparking the debate on the need for fundamental taxation reform in our country. It is an example of the growing, precarious and uncertain nature of the tax base in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was interested in what the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) had to say in relation to the High Court decision, but unfortunately, I think he missed the point entirely. The ability of the states and territories to collect certain charges and excise has been seriously challenged. Indeed, the need for change and reform in the area of Commonwealth&hyphen;state financial relations is one of the criteria the government will be looking at very closely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many differences between the coalition and Labor on the issue of taxation reform. On the one hand, we have the Liberal&hyphen;National coalition advocating a simpler and fairer tax system. On the other, we have the ALP advocating doing nothing about tax&mdash;living in the 1950s, keeping it complicated, unfair and inequitable.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8414">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) quite rightly observes, you could not believe what they say anyway. On the one hand, we have the Liberal&hyphen;National coalition advocating a lower personal income tax and lower payroll tax and, on the other, we have the ALP advocating higher income tax, higher payroll tax, higher sales tax and the old chestnut, to quote the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans), death duties. On the one hand we have the Liberal&hyphen;National coalition advocating a modern and progressive tax system and on the other we have the ALP saying that they will not change anything: `When the system breaks down, we will just keep on patching it up again and again.' That is what they are saying.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition wants to put an end to the patch and fill approach to taxation reform in Australia. But in the meantime, we have some problems to deal with. As one of the memoranda to these series of bills explains, while the Commonwealth safety net measures maintain the budget integrity of the states and territories, there are still some holes to plug. The Excise Tariff (Fuel Rates Amendments) Bill 1997  revises many of the descriptions of fuel presently contained in the act to prominently relate those descriptions to fuel containing a chemical marker. The  Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1997  amends the revised rates incorporating the safety net into the new chemical marker orientated descriptions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, predominantly, these bills deal with the government's desire to crack down on fuel substitution. It is important to cut down on the misuse of fuel products. Fuel substitution is a problem and a concern to the government, as it was to the previous government, and no doubt will be to future governments. Appropriate penalties need to be in place and, indeed, acted upon. In this respect, the government has decided to introduce chemical tracers to concessional fuels before they enter home consumption. The second reading speech states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The tracer . . . will allow Customs to monitor products in the marketplace to ensure inappropriate usage of concessional fuels does not occur.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And certainly that is a sensible measure. As the member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly) noted, fuel substitution activities can be hard to detect. The introduction of a marker will make fuel substitution easier to detect. The legislation package is detailed and complicated but I am pleased to note that the government has consulted widely with interested parties. I certainly support this package of bills.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the previous speaker has explained, the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R257">Excise Tariff (Fuel Rates Amendments) Bill 1997</XREF>  and associated legislation require the addition of a suitable chemical marker to petroleum or petroleum like products that have zero or concessional rates of excise tax applied to them. The reason we feel this is necessary is to combat the financial incentive to use these concessional rate fuel substitutes as substitutes for petroleum products such as petrol or diesel, which are attracting the highest excise taxes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the substitution fuels that we are talking about, such as heating oil and kerosene, a tax is paid at a concessional rate of 7.2c a litre. Solvents, turpentine, white oil and other products, such as dry&hyphen;cleaning fluid, attract no tax at all. Obviously, there is an incentive to mix these products with diesel or petrol, which is taxed at higher levels&mdash;for example, unleaded petrol and diesel is taxed at the rate of 34.697c a litre and leaded petrol is taxed at the rate of 36.872c a litre.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you mixed a fifty&hyphen;fifty shandy of heating oil and kerosene, taxed at 7.2c a litre, with petrol or diesel, you have a mix of 34c a litre for 50 per cent of the product, and 7c a litre for the other 50 per cent of the product, giving an average excise tax of around 20c a litre. So you 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8415"> would be paying tax of 20c a litre instead of 34c or 35c a litre, which is a saving of 14c or 15c a litre. It does not take much imagination to see where that can lead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am told that most fuel in this country is sold at an average profit of about 2.2c a litre. If you can suddenly lift your profit sevenfold from 2c a litre to 14c a litre, then there is a great financial incentive there to do the wrong thing. Semitrailers comfortably hold a thousand litres, and when you multiply that by 14c a litre, you have a profit margin there of $140. Even if you discount that to get the sale, you are still looking at $100 every time you fill up a semitrailer. Let us say they do two kilometres for every litre of fuel. If they are running full bore all of the time, and most of them have to to break even, let alone to make a profit, they could be saving $100 every second day. That translates into about $15,000 to $20,000 a year just on one unit on the road. Even by conservative estimates, you would be looking at a saving of $10,000 per year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That has many ramifications. First of all, it means people can act illegally to give themselves an unfair price advantage over fuel distributors who are operating legally. In other words, it penalises the honest. This has come about only in recent years because of the tremendous amount of tax that the previous government put on fuel. When we left office in 1983, the excise on fuel federally was of the order of about six cents a litre whereas today it is approaching 36c a litre and hence there is this financial incentive to do the wrong thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The trouble is that there has been no real penalty for people who are caught out doing this. Also, it has been very hard, if not impossible, to detect those who are doing it. Of course, had we got into power in 1993 a GST would have been applied to everything. Everything would have been taxed at the same level and so this financial incentive to do the wrong thing would not have existed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I say, you cannot detect it chemically, or it is very hard to do so, despite what people might think. Also, it is very hard, if not impossible, to get prosecutions. But putting a chemical marker in, which should have been done years ago, only adds a cost to the fuel, we estimate, of 0.00045c per litre. Therefore, the cost of getting rid of this problem is absolutely negligible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the notes that the minister has supplied it says that the Commonwealth will collect an extra $25 million of tax a year by cutting out this practice. The people in my electorate tell me that it is much more prevalent than that. One person who ran some sums past me estimated that the government could be collecting hundreds of millions, up to $300 million. But, on top of that, these people are getting around paying state tax, and it was estimated that New South Wales has lost $7 million a year and Victoria has lost $14 million a year just because of this practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This morning I rang one of the people in my electorate who had been complaining to me over the years, Graham Hitchick from Bogan Gate. I said, `How is the problem at the moment? Has it eased off since it is now public knowledge that these bills will be passed and this will become illegal?' He said, `To be quite frank, the problem has gotten worse. It has not eased off at all.' The person in his district who is supplying this fuel is running up and down the road every day supplying hundreds of thousands of litres of this fuel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He also had another problem in his area. It seems the air force had some jet A1 fuel, similar to kerosene, that was not up to specification, and so the air force sold it in the district for about 25c a litre. It was shandied with normal fuel as a 50&hyphen;50 mixture. It makes it very hard for a fellow who is operating honestly to be able to compete with that because their customers say, `You're selling me fuel at such and such a price whereas I can get it from Joe Bloggs down 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8416"> the road at 4c or 5c cents a litre cheaper.' They then take the business away from these honest people. That has been shutting down the little operators in country towns, which is very sad to see.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He made a point also about engine damage as a result of using these fuels. Obviously, it can be very damaging to the modern electronic fuel injected petrol engines, but with some diesel engines it can also be damaging. There are basically two types of diesel engines. One is the pushrod type injector diesel engine such as the Cummins and GM engines, the larger diesel engines, and this blend of fuel has little effect on them. However, with the rotary injector pump diesel engines&mdash;the engines in the smaller trucks that run around, such as the Bedfords and Isuzus&mdash;the blended fuels that are being used in them are much drier than the straight diesel, which acts as its own lubricant. The blended fuel is causing tremendous damage to the injectors and piston crowns of these engines. It is proving to be a false economy to those who are using this fuel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have another constituent who distributes fuel out of Dubbo. I will read the letter that he wrote to me. In 1987, he started off by employing five people and he has built up his business today to employ 54 people. As he says, the customs duty alone on the fuel is $15 million a year, and he and his employees pay $450,000 tax a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He has a fleet of 15 modern vehicles to distribute the fuel and he has the latest computer technology. As he says in his letter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are we believe a good Australian corporate citizen and are a proud member of the small business community.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reason for this letter to you is to highlight what we see as a real potential threat to the future viability of our business. That is the growth of the blended fuel industry. At this stage, we wish to make it clear that we are not talking about the legal blended fuel alternatives such as ethanol but the shady practice of blending crude oil, sump oil, condensate, refinery bottoms, solvents, heating oil, jet fuel and many other petrol distillate substitutes into petrol and distillate and selling it into the general market to internal combustion engines.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The operators moving into this field are typically here today gone tomorrow operators. They use substandard practices and equipment, quite often flouting all government regulations both State and Federal and making supernormal profits at the expense of the consumer, government, legitimate operators like ourselves and the wider community.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over the last few years we have seen the growth of blended fuel as an alternative fuel available to the transport sector. The use of this fuel has grown to the point where it is my belief that all the major transport companies in Dubbo now are obtaining their bulk requirements from the blended market rather than using distillate with full customs duty. This blended fuel is also making inroads into the reseller market as retail service stations are making partial purchases of this sort of fuel.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Now that is a pretty big statement. Dubbo is probably the biggest trucking transport centre in Australia in many ways, certainly in country areas. It is the hub of the west and it is a central point for operators operating out of South Australia, Victoria and Queensland, as well as New South Wales. And he says every major transport company in Dubbo is using blended fuel today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason he has not complained much about it up until now is that the margins selling into these industries are very tight indeed. They tend to be slow payers because they are under 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8417"> financial pressures et cetera. The reason he wrote to me is that they are starting to push this blended fuel into the farming sector, and that is where his concern was. He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . legitimate operators like ourselves are being forced out of business by those who choose to use the cheaper blended fuel. It has become a case of join the gang or go out of business. The same is happening in the reseller market as otherwise honest service stations choose to buy a proportion of blended fuel to remain viable and compete against the service stations who sell blended fuel.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Later in his letter, he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Customs Department is aware of the loss of an estimated $300,000,000.00 in government revenue and has failed to have a successful prosecution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What is of a more disturbing issue to us is the knowledge that an old depot is reopening in Narromine near Dubbo by an organisation well&hyphen;known to the Customs Department as a blender. In the past we have not seen blended fuel flowing into the farm market very much with the exception of the Gunnedah area. If the blended fuel starts to flow in the farm market this will have further repercussions for our business viability and your revenue problems. In effect the Government will be paying to the primary production industry the rebate back on the customs duty when it was not paid or only partially paid in the first place.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think that is an excellent letter in summing up what has been blatantly going on in this country today. It is a great shame that no action has been taken until now. I had a number of representations in past years to the previous government and no action was taken. I am delighted that the previous minister, Geoff Prosser, and the present Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs, Chris Ellison, have taken action, which everybody says will work. I cannot stress too much that this use of blended or substitute fuel is very prevalent. It is not something that is going on in an intermittent basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The customs department alone has had over 150 complaints in the last two years. The use of this fuel has risen by some estimates by 300 per cent over the last couple of years; it continues to increase and, as I say, the fines have been totally inadequate. In that previous letter where the person mentioned the use in Gunnedah of fuel going on to farms, that instance was where two million litres of avtur were mixed with distillate and sold around the district. It is just going on blatantly and nobody has been able to do anything about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do say that legal blending in some cases is allowed to be used. We have struck that problem in farming areas, particularly in cold areas, where some types of distillate were waxing up early on frosty mornings and it was very hard to start tractor engines. Legally, you can get permission to blend 25 to 50 per cent of heating oil into the distillate. An excise tax is then paid on the heating oil at the full rate of 34c a litre. But while that is legal, most of the operations with blending or substitute are illegal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been stressed to me, too, that when this legislation is passed, Customs must have access for sampling at all areas of the distribution chain, from the point where the chemical marker should have been added, onwards. This sampling must be done at random for it to work. It has also been stressed to me that the chemical marker must be in all solvents; there should be no exemptions whatsoever. For example, solvent 99, as it is called, is a distillate substitute and solvent 13 is a petrol substitute and if these are exempted this practice will go on. Both solvent 99 and solvent 13 are cutting agents used in the manufacturing industry. They are evaporated off and used as a fuel medium in, for example, the paint manufacturing industry. They can be purchased for about 30c a litre and mixed in with fuels where the tax alone is of the order of 34c or 35c a litre.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also essential, as the legislation provides, to have the chemical marker in on&hyphen;shore condensate. I know it is exempted for off&hyphen;shore condensate, but a lot of the problem in my 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8418"> area is the condensate coming down from south&hyphen;west Queensland. One estimate I had was of 600,000 litres a week going through Narromine alone down to Sydney and being made into other products which are then mixed with diesel. So I do stress that the chemical marker must go into on&hyphen;shore condensate otherwise this legislation will not work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The penalties up until now for the improper use of blending agents have been virtually zero. There has been no disincentive for anyone to do the right thing. The penalties for people that would be doing this start, as I understand it, at the $50,000 level, except for more minor offences. So we will be able to detect it and put on proper penalties and, if it is shown that these penalties are not sufficient, perhaps the legislation should be amended to increase these penalties at a later date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just want to again mention briefly the engine damage that can be done. It blocks filters and injections&mdash;the tips of the injectors can actually melt in some cases. It can cause irreparable engine damage. It can make engines hard to start because the thicker blending agents will not atomise properly and it causes black smoke out of the exhausts. But, perhaps, more important is the safety angle. The flashpoint of diesel is around 61 degrees Centigrade, although some companies have it up as high as 64 degrees Centigrade. But kerosene, one of the common blending agents, is as low as 38 degrees Centigrade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You get truck operators checking the diesel levels in their tanks by using the naked flame of a match and we have had cases with blended fuels where there have been explosions. You can imagine what can happen in a truck accident. There is a much increased chance of getting an explosion and if the driver was trapped in the cabin he or she could be incinerated alive. In July two years ago there was a person seriously injured in South Australia who was welding a fuel tank and thought there was diesel in it; it turned out to be one of these blended agents where the flash point was much lower. So there is a very great safety angle here. The legislation, I believe, is worth bringing in and implementing just from the safety angle alone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do compliment particularly the previous minister, Geoff Prosser&mdash;under whom most of this legislation was put together&mdash;for bringing this in. It was something that was sorely needed. It is a very simple thing and it can be implemented at low cost. I believe it will not only be beneficial to revenue, but will help small business and improve the safety of the transport industry in this country.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to sum up on behalf of the government. This package of nine bills is designed to give effect to our announcement in the last budget that we would be cracking down on fuel substitution. I thank the members who have contributed in the debate on this issue today, particularly the member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly), the member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) and the member for Parkes (Mr Cobb), who raised matters of vital importance to their constituents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has certainly been a longstanding and well&hyphen;accepted policy of successive governments that, where excise is imposed on petroleum products, differential rates of duty are applied on the basis of the intended end use of the product. The highest rate of customs and excise duty is imposed on fuels, such as gasoline and automotive diesel oil, for on&hyphen;road transport use.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The specifications for some concessional and zero&hyphen;rated petroleum products, such as solvents, may be very similar to those for on&hyphen;road fuels, particularly automotive diesel oil. Accordingly, substitution of lower duty products for on&hyphen;road uses is, unfortunately, attractive to unscrupulous operators. For example, if product declared as a solvent at the terminal gate of a major oil 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8419"> company is subsequently blended with automotive diesel oil by a party in the retail distribution system, the windfall gain from this fraud is quite substantial.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1997&hyphen;98 budget estimated that the measures underpinned by this legislative package will lead to increased revenue in the order of $25 million in a full year. It is worth bearing in mind, as the member for Parkes has rightly stressed, that use of these fuels can greatly harm engine performance and expose consumers to great danger as the blends containing substituted fuel may have a much lower flash point than a proper diesel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We decided that the best way to minimise these practices is to require the introduction of chemical tracers to concessional fuels before they enter home consumption. The tracer will allow Customs to monitor products in the marketplace to ensure inappropriate usage of concessional fuels does not occur. The presence of the marker will make illegal substitutions simple to detect, both by Customs and by participants in the market who wish to do so. There has been very good cooperation and consultation with industry with regard to this whole approach that the government has adopted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I reiterate that the government is introducing these measures to increase compliance with long&hyphen;established excise taxation policy, as well as to address loopholes in existing excise legislation where it does not deliver this policy. This is obviously going to be of benefit to the government, in terms of collecting the proper excise revenue legislated by the parliament; to consumers, in terms of safer petroleum products; and, let us not forget, to those honest participants who form the vast majority of the petroleum products distribution retail system who wish to compete on level terms. I will table the supplementary explanatory memoranda.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to extend my profound thanks to the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price), who has given me the opportunity to speak on the Family Court of Western Australia (Orders of Registrars) Bill 1997&mdash;because of a double&hyphen;booking in the other chamber, I suspect. He has said he is going to exact a price in the future&mdash;no pun intended&mdash;so I am looking forward to that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although this bill was born of a landmark case in the Family Court of Australia earlier this year, it is not a contentious one and, to my mind, it is fairly straightforward. These amendments are of significance, however, to the constituents of Curtin, who will be adversely affected if this measure is not passed. The Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams), in his second reading speech, observed that this bill will have no significant financial impact on the Commonwealth. That may be true, but it will have substantial social consequences for the many hundreds of Western Australians affected by the Family Court of Australia's decision in the Horne case in February this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Notwithstanding the other important pieces of legislation that have been dealt with in this place this year, it is lamentable that the government has waited for more than six months before bringing on the debate and proposing this measure. Even the Western Australian state parliament, with its inability to properly manage its own legislative program, has managed to act before now and introduce complementary legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the bulk of those affected by the Family Court decision will not have their consent orders validated by the state legislation because Western Australia does not have the constitutional authority to validate retrospectively the exercise of Commonwealth judicial 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8424"> power. This parliament is the only one that can do that by passing amendments to the Family Law Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As was pointed out during debate on the complementary legislation in the Western Australian state parliament:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The door was open for people to behave improperly when the decision was handed down by the full court on 13 February (1997). That door will remain open for people to behave improperly until such time as (the) federal parliament enacts legislation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This bill should have been here much earlier, as I have indicated. The bill simply seeks to maintain the status quo of family law in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By correcting a technical flaw in the current legislation, it serves to realign the powers of the Family Court of Western Australia with that of the Commonwealth. Section 41 of the Family Law Act 1975 invites each state to form their own family court but specifies that in all key respects these courts must possess the characteristics of the Family Court of Australia. I repeat: in all key respects a state family court must possess the same characteristics as that of the original Commonwealth Family Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Family Court of Western Australia has been invested with Commonwealth jurisdiction under the Marriage Act and the Family Law Act since its genesis on 1 June 1976. Mr Anthony Dickey, in his book entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Family Law</EMPHASIS>, writes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By providing for the creation of the state family courts, it was envisaged that many of the problems resulting from a divided family law jurisdiction could be avoided.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Indeed, it is because of the fragmented spheres of duty in Australian family law that this bill has become necessary. As Finlay and Bailey&hyphen;Harris noted in a publication that appeared in 1989:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The increasing mobility and homogeneity of the Australian people makes it desirable that to a maximum extent legislation affecting the family should be uniform throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is perhaps regrettable then that Western Australia has been the only state to take up the Commonwealth's offer to establish its own Family Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Section 37A of the Family Law Act 1975 provided the registrars of the Commonwealth Family Court with specific powers. This included the authority to make consent orders and to register parenting plans following the breakdown of a nuptial relationship. Western Australian registrars have been issuing the same orders not realising that the original transfer of authority from the judges to them was not the subject of any power of review by the judges of that court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The consequence of this is that all orders made by registrars in the Western Australian family courts since 16 December 1985 are null and void. The ramifications of this finding should not be underestimated. The majority of people who file applications with the Family Court of Western Australia choose to negotiate a consent order to settle property disputes as opposed to having a contested hearing before a judge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this amendment before us today had not been proposed most of these consent orders would have remained deficient. It is for this reason that the retrospective nature of this amendment is entirely supportable. I made clear my position on the implementation of retrospective legislation many times in this place where it imposes a burden, but this certainly is not in that category. It is not appropriate for this or any parliament to introduce retrospective legislation where it harms or takes things away from people. This legislation, as I have indicated, is not 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8425"> about taking something from anyone. On the contrary, it endeavours to declare effective those consent orders that were agreed to by all parties concerned in Western Australia but that are now proved to be ineffective because of an oversight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clause 5 in the bill indicates that the statutory rights and liabilities of all persons are the same as those that would have been created by the relevant ineffective order if it had been a valid order made by the Family Court of Western Australia in the exercise of its federal family law jurisdiction. That is straightforward and eminently reasonable. In the meantime, as the Western Australian Attorney&hyphen;General has observed, registrars in Western Australia have ceased to act as registrars in the issuing of consent orders and instead have acted in their capacity as magistrates to ensure that consent orders made since the court decision have been valid. The Attorney&hyphen;General of Western Australia noted also that this is entirely acceptable as `they are able validly to deal with those orders because a proper delegation is available to them and magistrates can be reviewed.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is not an issue in states rights. It will not see the erosion of the authority of the Western Australian Family Court. Rather it seeks to maintain a uniform legislative framework&mdash;an area in which Australia has a poor track record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr D. H. O'Neil, the minister in the Western Australian government who enacted the establishment of the Western Australian Family Court, outlined the rationale behind the move in parliament on 21 October 1975. He noted that a state based Family Law Court would:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">enable the state to continue to exercise jurisdiction in family law matters which would otherwise have been removed into the Federal Court of Australia with the opportunity of retaining complementary action with other responsibilities in the areas of welfare and counselling services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Several legal academics have observed that this is one of the more positive enduring legacies of the introduction of the Western Australian Family Court. The authors of a book entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Family Law in Australia</EMPHASIS> wrote that our state based Family Law Court avoids both the practical and jurisdictional difficulties that are part and parcel of our fractured family law legislation. This was reinforced in the Federal Court last year when Chief Justice Michael Black said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The history of federal, state and territory . . . courts in Australia . . . shows that cooperation can avoid jurisdictional conflict and that conflict is not the inevitable consequence of the existence in a federation of more than one system of courts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will not impact on existing family law statutes in other states. It merely legitimises the current state of play and will mean that the administration of justice in Western Australia remains close to the people it is meant to assist. Nor does it contain any of the flaws of the state legislation that caused concern within the legal profession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clause 7 of the Western Australian legislation related to contempt proceedings and was identified as being an important deficiency in the bill. However, there is no such inclusion in the legislation before this chamber. The Law Society of Western Australia has observed in its draft advice that `it seems to adequately address the difficulties raised by the full court decision.' As I suggested earlier, the bill is not a controversial one. When section 41 of the principal Family Law Act was introduced by the then Labor Party government some 20 years ago, it was endorsed by the conservative parties because it was seen to facilitate cooperative federalism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the same way, I anticipate that this amendment will garner the support of all in this place irrespective of their political persuasions. The bill is both sensible and necessary. It will correct 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8426"> a drafting error to ensure that Western Australian registrars are empowered in the same terms as Family Court registrars elsewhere. I commend the bill to the house.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R230">Family Court of Western Australia (Orders of Registrars) Bill 1997</XREF>  I put on the record that my interest in this bill is not only as a Western Australian but also as a committee member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. I have had an opportunity to visit the Family Court of Western Australia and see its operations and I am pleased to be able to speak in relation to this fine institution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make some brief comments on the bill because it addresses issues which have caused some concern to people not only in my electorate of Swan&mdash;I have been contacted by a few constituents with concerns about this matter&mdash;but also to the wider Western Australian community who have had dealings with the Family Court of Western Australia. Much of what I am going to say has been mentioned by the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) but I would like to show that there is certainly agreement across the chamber on this because it is a non&hyphen;contentious bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The  Family Court of Western Australia (Orders of Registrars) Bill 1997 seeks to rectify the previous legislation which allowed registrars of the Family Court of Western Australia to make certain rulings or consent orders which were found by the full court of the Family Court to be invalid. These rulings involved family law matters of visitation, property and financial settlements, child guardianship and numerous other aspects of the family law. Western Australia, as has already been stated, is a unique state in that when the Family Law Act of 1975 was passed each state was given the opportunity to establish its own family court but only Western Australia did so. As a result, the Family Court of Western Australia exercises federal jurisdiction and state jurisdiction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following Horne v. Horne, which drew attention to the invalidity of certain consent orders, I received, as I said, several calls and communications from constituents who were concerned that their settlements and agreements might be invalid. There were quite a few people who were afraid that they would have to go back to court and that considerable financial and emotional costs would have to be expended to go through the processes again. However, the Commonwealth government and the Western Australian state government did immediately recognise the ramifications of Horne v. Horne. We are now seeing the Commonwealth and the state government of Western Australia working closely on this legislative solution to the family law problem to ensure efficiency of law and fairness to the people of Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I point out that there are people, who are no longer in Western Australia but who were affected by the findings of Horne v. Horne, who will have the same statutory rights as Western Australians similarly affected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand orders are not being made at present and that lawyers are advising their clients to wait until this legislation is enacted. That is the reason for some urgency in terms of this legislation. It is essential that we get on with the business of this bill before us to alleviate the concerns of the very many Western Australians who are affected by the full court decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The full court of the Family Court decided, following the Horne v. Horne case in February this year, that consent orders made since the mid-1980s by registrars of the Family Court of Western Australia were not valid, as has been stated. The case came about when one of the parties sought to set aside an order made by a registrar with regard to a property dispute. The appellant argued that neither the Family Court Act of Western Australia nor the Family Law 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8427"> Act of the Commonwealth delegated the requisite judicial power to registrars of the Family Court of Western Australia to make such consent orders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The full court of the Family Court decided that the registrars certainly did not have the power to make consent orders. The court's decision was based on the absence of any statutory provision or, in other words, rule of court, under the Western Australian legislation that provides parties with the right to seek review of the decisions of the registrars. Clearly, in matters of family law, as with other areas of law, there needs to be some mechanism by which decisions can be reviewed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to note that the full court's decision is not expected to have any ramifications for the exercise of powers by the registrars of the Family Court of Australia. However, decisions of registrars of the Family Court of Western Australia made since the 1980s have been put in question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill, as I have stated and as the member for Curtin has stated, will overcome the technical legal problem by ensuring that all affected people obtain enforceable statutory family law rights and liabilities that mirror the rights and liabilities that would have been created by valid registrars orders. To ensure the situation being addressed by this bill does not occur again, there will be provision for delegation to registrars and review of their decisions by the courts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It can be safely said that family law is one of the most emotional and volatile areas of law. Sadly, in my electorate of Swan, I see the results of family breakdown far too often when people contact my office for assistance with regard to child support especially, and with regard to visitation of their children when one of the parents is ignoring rulings made by the court. At other times they need to know who else can help them other than the courts. These people do not want to relive the circumstances which saw them go to the Family Court in the first place and we have to ensure that everything can be done to make this legislation, and future decisions made by the court, absolutely watertight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said earlier, I understand that orders are not being made at present and lawyers are advising their clients to wait until this legislation is enacted. Court cases have been adjourned and people are waiting for this problem to be resolved quickly so they can get on with their lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because of the uncertainty caused by the Horne v. Horne decision, injunctions have been lodged on settlements of property and finances, which is a disappointing situation for those involved. People are ceasing to adhere to orders of visitation and of child support while they believe the orders to be invalid. This is affecting the children who are all too often the innocent victims of matters to do with family law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Child Support Agency has reported numerous instances where parents have contacted the agency asking for their payments to be suspended because of the invalidation of the orders under which the payment schedules were made. These parents will, of course, have to pay back monies once the legislation has been passed, but in the meantime the children are losing out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In another instance, a mother of two children has become very worried since learning that her custody order was signed by a registrar. This woman had already been through a protracted court hearing involving her violent ex-husband who had also sought custody. This woman was understandably seriously concerned that her ex-husband would feel that he had a right to custody in some interim type arrangement while the matter of this particular order was 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8428"> investigated because of its invalidation. This is very undesirable at a time when the security of the woman and that of her children are at risk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many people who are in limbo waiting for this legislation to be passed. Others are waiting for their own cases to be heard and their dealings with the Family Court to be finalised. They are hoping that the associated emotional turmoil and stress can be finalised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, this bill, by creating new and enforceable statutory family law rights, addresses the problems causing anguish to so many Western Australians following the invalidation of the orders. In also acknowledging the cooperation of the Western Australian state government, I commend this bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to speak on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R230">Family Court of Western Australia (Orders of Registrars) Bill 1997</XREF> . As the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) foreshadowed, we do not have any difficulty with this legislation. I will indicate briefly what has led to this legislation. As previous speakers have indicated, it arose out of a case, Horne v. Horne. The husband appealed against the deputy registrar's order. He alleged, amongst other things, that the Registrar and Deputy Registrar of the Family Court of Western Australia did not have the power to make such orders.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Horne v. Horne, the full court of the Family Court held that the consent orders which had been made by the deputy registrar were made without jurisdiction and were invalid. The deputy registrar was purportedly acting under family law rules. However, the full court found that, whilst rules could be made for practice and procedure, this did not enable rules to be made which did not provide for the review of the registrar's decision by a judge, by way of a new hearing on all the issues of fact and law. A right of judicial review of decisions of officers like registrars, who exercise delegated judicial power, was seen by the court as a substantive right which could not be impinged upon by rules made under a practice and procedure power.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The appeal did not challenge the powers of registrars operating under the Family Court of Australia. This piece of legislation rectifies that situation by providing new rights and obligations to the parties, and is, as I said, supported.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to confess that my interest in family law really started with an interest in child support. You cannot fix child support without getting the family law issues correct. As the honourable member for Curtin pointed out, when the Family Court was being set up, each state had the opportunity to set up their own family court. Western Australia was the only state that exercised that option. My natural instinct would be to see a completely centralised court, although I have had cause to reflect on that. The Family Court of Western Australia is a state based court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the debate on this bill, I indicate that I support some of the initiatives being undertaken by the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) in the family law area. The first one deals with section 121, the so&hyphen;called secrecy provisions of the Family Law Act. At the moment, the legislation makes it next to impossible for the media to report the proceedings of the Family Court, whether they are in Western Australia or in any other state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst that may have been a provision that attracted a lot of support in 1975, we need to recognise that our Australian society has moved on. It is no longer extraordinary in any family to have a family member who has been divorced or separated. I do not believe that the children suffer, as they may once have suffered, with the so&hyphen;called stigma of family break&hyphen;up. I am sure they are not the winners out of family break&hyphen;up, but I do not believe we can talk about the same social stigma.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8429">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Attorney&hyphen;General has commissioned a report, the so&hyphen;called McCall report, looking into section 121 of the Family Law Act&mdash;the secrecy provisions&mdash;and they are recommending what I would call some very modest changes. From my own party's perspective we do not seem to be handling these initiatives in a very proactive way. If I have a criticism about the McCall recommendations it is that they do not go far enough. I do not really believe that there is a need for a blanket secrecy provision. I do not believe that we need to protect children from information that their parents may be splitting up. In fact, I have confidence in the procedures that operate in any other court. That is, if the parties to a matter wish to have their names suppressed, an application is made to the judge and that application is decided on its merits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This secrecy provision&mdash;with great respect&mdash;operates not for ordinary citizens or their children in this land; it operates for the benefit of the wealthy and, dare I say, members of parliament to ensure that these matters are not reported on. I think that the secrecy provisions have had a most adverse impact on the Family Court. Its proceedings are little understood and the normal scrutiny of the operations of all courts that you expect in a democracy&mdash;whether it be of a magistrate's court, a family court or, indeed, the High Court&mdash;are denied. I think that it is bad for democracy, and I think it is even worse for the operations of a Family Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I would say this to the Attorney&hyphen;General and to honourable government backbenchers across the table: when considering the government's response to the McCall report, I would urge you to go further, to remove the secrecy provisions from the Family Court and then allow parties to hearings before the court to make an application to the judge and allow that judge then to decide those issues on their merits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, as I said, I welcome the initiative of the Attorney&hyphen;General in this matter. I would hope that my party would eventually take a very positive attitude to those initiatives, although I cannot recall us being given an opportunity to date to discuss these matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other interesting aspect that I should raise in this debate about the Western Australia Family Court is, of course, that it does not have its own court counsellors. Again, the Attorney&hyphen;General in a most important speech in October of last year signalled his intention to examine&mdash;and he has now put a discussion paper out&mdash;the possibility of removing all non&hyphen;judicial functions from the Family Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Western Australia there are court counsellors&mdash;in fact, I have been over there&mdash;but they are counsellors who are employed by the relevant state department and they just happen to operate in the Family Court environment. In New Zealand, where there is a similar situation, you have five district court judges operating with a family court warrant and that court has absolutely no counsellors of its own. In fact, they are all private counsellors. The court has the money to requisition those counselling resources as they require.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is a far better system because&mdash;with no disrespect in this regard to the Family Court judges&mdash;I think that they are better judges than they are managers of non&hyphen;judicial services. The more we can focus them on their strictly judicial responsibilities, the better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thought it was interesting that we had a contribution from the member for Swan (Mr Randall), who is a member of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. There has been a very important decision recently brought up in the national newspapers that does have an effect in the family law area, and that is the so&hyphen;called Brandy case. In this instance, the decisions of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission were determined to be exercising judicial power and, therefore, those decisions were struck down.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8430">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You might ask, quite rightly, how this impacts on family law. I should first respond to the Attorney&hyphen;General by correcting a statement he made in the House, and that is to say that I have read the Brandy decision at length a number of times. But if there is one real reform that we need to embrace in this family law area, particularly in relation to the Family Court, it is establishing a new tribunal, with arbitration powers, where parties can bring property, residency and contact issues without legal representation and have those matters arbitrated, not according to procedures that you would expect if judicial power were being exercised, but under an administrative tribunal arrangement similar to the Small Claims Tribunal in our state or the tenants and residency tribunal that has been established in our state and in a number of other state jurisdictions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This decision, I regret to say, has been interpreted as removing the ability of the Commonwealth to establish such a no&hyphen;frills family tribunal exercising arbitration powers in these matters. If that is the case, it is a most regrettable decision by the High Court. I am most loath to criticise the High Court, but what they are failing to consider is this: whilst it is true that the rule of law is absolutely fundamental to our human rights infrastructure in Australia, where you have the case that citizens cannot afford to exercise those rights, then that is justice denied, that is human rights denied and it makes a mockery of the rule of law. Those things must be precious to us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have often been accused of wanting to abolish the Family Court of Australia. Nothing could be further from the truth. We will always have those citizens in our society who will want to opt for that as a mechanism for resolving their disputes. You will also have other categories of cases, particularly where there is clearly demonstrated domestic violence, where the issues must be determined by the courts of the land. But I sincerely believe we need to provide citizens with choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not everyone wishes to have their family affairs sorted out in the court, because it becomes such an expensive exercise. In so many cases I can report that more money was spent on legal representation than was ever distributed between the parties or set aside for the future of the children of the family being separated. This is an absolute tragedy. I say to the Attorney&hyphen;General that I certainly support the initiative as far as secrecy is concerned. I believe it is appropriate that we look at this issue about the non&hyphen;judicial functions within the Family Court and I can see that the creation of a magistracy will provide some relief, but that does not really provide the critical solution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think we can avoid forever looking seriously at setting up such a tribunal. The interesting thing is that because the Western Australian Family Court is set up under state jurisdiction, it is much easier to actually set up such a tribunal in Western Australia. As I said, I would normally have felt that in looking at the history of the establishment of the Family Court and Western Australia opting to exercise its right to have a state family court, I perhaps would have been a bit negative about that. I think it is positive. I say then that if, at the Commonwealth level, we are so constrained that we cannot set up this no&hyphen;frills family tribunal arbitrating decisions, then maybe we need to consider vacating this area and, indeed, encouraging the states again to look at this opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No matter how much I support some of these reforms or initiatives that the Attorney&hyphen;General is currently contemplating, we cannot avoid the really tough issues. The biggest issue is that too many people are being forced into getting legal representation and slugging their cases out in front of deputy registrars, registrars or judicial registrars, not to mention magistrates 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8431"> and, indeed, judges. We need to reserve the judges for the highest level of judicial decision making and not squander what is a precious human rights resource. We really do have to update our thinking, particularly with the next millennium coming upon us, to make sure that the law, if not in all areas then in this most important family law area, is accessible to ordinary citizens. That ought to be the test, for either a government or an opposition: how they are going to deal with these matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did say that my original interest in all this came through looking at the child support scheme. Of course, some of the orders that can be obtained from deputy registrars relate to that scheme. I note that there has been speculation in the paper about the government announcing reform of the child support scheme, and probably today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS> has the most detailed information. Let me say that I know that there has been disappointment expressed that they do not go far enough&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was talking about the article about child support in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS> . A lot of people have said it is disappointing. I agree, but I also think it is important for the government to announce the changes as quickly as possible. I think the real danger is thinking that you can, in either family law or child support, announce changes and then box them in concrete for a great period of time. A scheme like the child support scheme is a dynamic one that needs to be constantly monitored and constantly finetuned. I would have hoped that for the government the starting point might have been the recommendations that the joint committee made. Hopefully, in the not too distant future, we could move on beyond those recommendations and implement even further reform.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I certainly support these changes that provide certainty for consent orders by registrars in the Western Australian Family Court. I have indicated my support for a number of the initiatives that the Attorney&hyphen;General has commenced or has undertaken. I sincerely hope that my party will have an opportunity to examine these and consider them in detail and move along into the next millennium taking up the challenge of reforming family law. I support the bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA STYLE="Para">With that power, the federal government set up the Family Law Act. At that time, the states were given an opportunity to set up their own court. Of all the states, Western Australia was 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8432"> the only one to do so. It is quite obvious that the parochial feelings in Western Australia are strongly against any sort of federal intervention and strongly support their own state's rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think Richard Court in the article `The rebuilding of the federation and audited history of state powers and responsibilities usurped by the Commonwealth in the years since federation'&mdash;notice the colourful language&mdash;pretty well sums up the attitude of the Premier in Western Australia to federal powers of governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, one must query the relevance in that instance of the states. As the Commonwealth gains more and more powers, how relevant then does the law&hyphen;making ability of the states become? I noticed recently that Bob Carr already seeks to reduce the number of members in the New South Wales state parliament. In fact, he could almost reduce them to nothing if he was serious about saving expenses to taxpayers and not about representation. Is it really just a rort in New South Wales or does he have a legitimate point about representation and the role of the states coming into the next millennium?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over time, the states have given more and more power in this area to the federal government and it has worked quite nicely. I noticed that the member for Chifley (Mr Price) wanted to go back to some sort of furthering of state powers in these matters. I hasten to remind him that it was cross&hyphen;jurisdictional issues that led to the states giving more and more powers to the federal government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite inappropriate that an offence under the Family Law Act in Victoria when the victims are in Tasmania and the perpetrators are in New South Wales cannot be prosecuted. AVOs cannot be enforced and all sorts of custodial and financial responsibility can be avoided by simply crossing state boundaries. There was a requirement for a federal, cohesive and comprehensive family law act. That is in place but it needs to be reassessed. Given the continuing evolution of our society, legislation will always need to be reassessed. It will always need to be amended, improved and updated to reflect current social trends.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I noticed in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph</EMPHASIS> yesterday the headline `A nation of bastards'. It actually got played right around the world. In fact, we were on APP, and it ended up in France with pictures of newsagents holding up our <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph</EMPHASIS> to the world, portraying Australia as a nation of bastards where one in three are born outside of marriage. That is a social trend in Australia. The commitment to marriage or the legal obligations of marriage have become so onerous&mdash;we are given such a terrible view in the media of incidents arising out of the Family Law Court&mdash;that a significant proportion of society is steering away from this traditional institution that is part of the fabric of our society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst contemplating social trends, and where society is going, I listened to Norm Swan's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Life Matters</EMPHASIS> program. He was talking about a report from the United States which had surveyed over 90,000 children from homes with two parents and from homes with a single parent. They felt the distinction was scientifically justifiable. There are a number of problems associated with lone parent families, the raising of their children and their subsequent involvement in terms of where they got their values and social consciences from.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is something that society has to address. We have to study it and research it. It is something that our laws need to address. It is also something that needs to be in the national interests of Australia. I do not think we can keep coming back to the federal government to solve problems in Western Australia because Richard Court finds himself unable to fall in line with the rest of Australia. He seeks still to see the states retain some independence for their own financial ability.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8433">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The changes that we have seen in society in recent years have been extraordinary. There is a tendency not to get married. There is a trend towards de facto relationships, and a trend to not stay in a marriage or a relationship that is difficult. There is also a trend to go it alone and to raise children as a single parent. This has consequences throughout the fabric of society for what was the traditional role of females: to stay at home and do a lot of voluntary work. I do not think for a minute that females who stay at home do not work; they do an incredible amount for their neighbourhood, for their community and for the voluntary organisations of our nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the effect on those voluntary hours due to females entering the workplace&mdash;and I have no intention of leaving it&mdash;that I am interested in. I speak firmly for female choice. I strongly believe that females should always have a choice, but the fact is that those voluntary hours that females contribute, whilst they maintain a traditional role at home, are lost. The implications for society are quite significant, and the implications for families in the future are quite significant also.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We tend to look at institutions such as the family law court, at alternative dispute resolution, at counselling services, at a number of other institutions and at government provided services to fill in the gaps. I do not think they will ever adequately replace what has been lost, but certainly it is a matter of feeling our way to the new society that is shaping up into the next millennium.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also has major implications in terms of cross-generational interaction. Often, people now are separated from their families. Young children do not have a close relationship with their grandparents or do not have a high exposure to young children and babies. Consequently, when the women of today are handed their first child, it is quite a novel experience and possibly the only such infant that they have ever held in their lives. That does have significant implications for society. It is simply a trend. It is something that we must go on addressing by being responsive to social trends and trying, through legislation, to keep up with social mores, choices and activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Chifley also raised the issue of the child support scheme and the difficulties that a lot of people experience with the scheme. It certainly is nowhere near as responsive as a traditional family with a husband on a wage and a wife at home and a guarantee of support. It just does not happen that way. I do not think the child support scheme in any way hopes to replace the type of support that is available in that situation; it merely is a financial administrator. The only support that it can give is financial. Again, that still leaves a lot of problems out there to be resolved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legal process through which we put people who once had a relationship that was close enough at some stage to produce a child needs reforming. We put them through a process in the family law courts where they will not even speak to each other except through lawyers. That says a lot about the process and the need to reform that process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly, these people will still be the parents of that child long after the initial two years of separation have passed and when all the anger and the angst and the revenge have been worked through. Certainly, at the child's 18th birthday party, at its 21st, at its engagement, at its wedding and at the birth of its children, those parents still have an obligation and a relationship with their child. That needs to be considered whenever you are making any changes to the family law court.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R230">Family Court of Western Australia (Orders of Registrars) Bill</XREF>  is a small and concise piece of legislation which has been crafted by the Attorney&hyphen;General of Australia (Mr Williams) to meet a particular need which resulted from a decision of the full court of the Family Court of Australia in the matter of the case of Horne v. Horne, which was a case taken to the full court of the Family Court on appeal from the Family Court of Western Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It ought to be noted that this legislation does not affect the Family Court of Australia. It merely refers to the Family Court of Western Australia, and it is a cooperative attempt to remedy a defect in the provisions of the Family Court of Western Australia. The Western Australian parliament has processed legislation designed to provide a state remedy in so far as the state parliament has the capacity to do so, and it is necessary for similar legislation to be passed through this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of Horne v. Horne, a concern was expressed that the consent order made by a registrar in that court had no force or effect because that consent order was not subject to the review of a court. The full court of the Family Court of Australia comprised Justices Fogarty, Lindenmeyer and Moore. They held that whether or not the judges of the Family Court of Western Australia had power to delegate to its registrars the power to make such order, the order here was invalid, as any such delegation was not the subject of any power for review by the judges of that court. So not only were people in the situation of the litigants in Horne v. Horne in trouble but many consent orders in Western Australia were placed in jeopardy as a result of this decision of the full court of the Family Court of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The lives of parliamentarians and ministers would be simpler if the courts did not intrude and upset what everyone thought was a reasonable legislative or administrative framework. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8435"> The simple fact of the matter in our system of government is that we do have checks and balances. It is appropriate that people do have redress to go to the courts when they are aggrieved. The situation in this case is that the husband, having agreed to a consent order, decided to contest the right of the deputy registrar to make it. In a sense, he was seeking to have his cake and eat it as well. At the end of the day, there has been a responsibility placed on the Western Australian parliament and on this parliament to remedy the situation, to ensure that people are not disadvantaged as a result of the decision of the full court of the Family Court in the case of Horne v. Horne.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose of this bill is to enable affected people to obtain enforceable statutory family law rights and responsibilities that would have been created by valid registrar orders without attempting to validate the invalid orders made. Some people might say that we are playing with words, but what the legislation does is not to invalidate what is invalid but rather to create a situation where people are not disadvantaged by the decision of the court in Horne v. Horne. In doing so, the bill proposes to create statutory rights and liabilities which are identical to the terms of the invalid orders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill, as I said, will complement the Western Australian legislation. That is why it is being put forward quickly. We are hopeful that the other place will process this legislation and give it the priority that it deserves, because a large number of people in Western Australia are disadvantaged, if not as a result of this particular case, then as a result of the poor or inadequate attempt to give registrars power to make decisions which are not subject to judicial review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once these bills are passed, parties affected by invalid orders will not need to take any additional court action to enforce their family law rights. As a lawyer, I can understand that some lawyers do see it as an advantage to go before the courts constantly. I am very pleased that the government has put the interests of litigants and partners to a broken marriage to the fore. They have ensured that, with this legislation being carried in conjunction with the Western Australian bill, people will not have to go back before the court, to take additional court action to enforce their family law rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are situations at the moment where people did think they had valid orders. Those orders are no longer valid, so there is a provision for pandemonium to reign supreme were this legislation not to pass, and pass quickly. I am confident that the government will receive the support of the opposition to ensure that this occurs. The purpose of our amendments is also to put beyond doubt the application of criminal sanctions to certain conduct. If enacted, the amendments will also correct a minor omission in subclause 4(4) of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation is important. It is not very long. It is legislation, however, which is vital and necessary to ensure that people who have been disadvantaged as a result of the decision of the full court of the Family Court of Australia that the delegation to the registrar was ineffective are not disadvantaged and that their position is restored to one where they will be in the same position were the orders made valid and not invalid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have spoken a little longer than I had planned in order to give the Attorney&hyphen;General time to get here. In summing up, this is a very important piece of legislation which seeks to remedy the results of the decision in Horne v. Horne in the full court of the Family Court. It is legislation which I believe is reasonable. The Attorney&hyphen;General is to be commended for introducing it to the parliament so expeditiously and&mdash;</PARA>

I thank honourable members on both sides of the House for their support for this remedial legislation. The bill will ensure that all people who may have been affected by the decision of the full court of the Family Court in the matter of Horne and Horne have no uncertainty about their legal status or about the legal status of what they had thought to be valid orders of the court.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill declares that all affected people have statutory family law rights and liabilities that are exercisable and enforceable in the same manner as court orders. It also provides that the same legal consequences arise out of the existence of these new statutory rights and liabilities as would have arisen out of court orders. As honourable members are aware, the speedy passage of the bill will give back legal certainty to all those people who may have been adversely affected by the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of speakers have indicated their support for the bill but have also made additional comments in relation to matters relevant and tangentially relevant. The member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) pointed out that it is regrettable that Western Australia is the only state to take up the offer to have its own family court. This does highlight a point, which is that the Commonwealth is unable, through the lack of constitutional power, to deal with all the issues that are likely to be dealt with in the family law area, in particular in relation to de facto relationships, although there have been references of powers in relation to exnuptial children. This is a situation that does not pertain in Western Australia, where the state court exercises federal jurisdiction and also exercises state jurisdiction, and therefore can effectively cover the field.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Swan (Mr Randall) also commended the unique Western Australian Family Court model, pointing out that it exercises both state and federal jurisdiction. If he is suggesting that other states ought to pick up the model and use it, I venture to suggest that that would be very difficult now, given the history of the creation of the Family Court and the separate creation of the Family Court of Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Chifley (Mr Price) has had a longstanding interest in family law matters and was the chairman of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues in the previous parliament. I welcome his support for the proposals to re&hyphen;examine section 121 of the Family Law Act which deals with the confidentiality of proceedings. This is not the place or the time to debate that issue. He dealt also with a number of other issues, including the exercise of non&hyphen;judicial functions by the court, about which he referred to the discussion paper 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8437"> recently issued by my department. He referred to the effect of Brandy's case and suggested a need for a new tribunal, and he referred to a proposal that I floated some time ago with respect to the creation of a federal magistracy. I think all of those matters can be left for another day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The child support scheme he also mentioned, that being the subject of the principal report of the committee of which he was chairman in the previous parliament. That has been the subject of announcements by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) and the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp) yesterday. Again, this is not the occasion for dealing with that in any detail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly) focused on the federal structure that sees a Family Court of Western Australia as well as a Family Court of Australia. Her focus of interest, however, was on the report on the front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph</EMPHASIS> yesterday referring to Australia as a `nation of bastards', which referred, of course, to the trend towards single parenthood and the trend towards de facto relationships in lieu of marriage. That simply highlights the difficulties the Commonwealth is in in relation to vesting jurisdiction over all relationship matters in the Family Court. They cannot be dealt with under the current constitutional structure.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The following funds have been allocated to overseas aid: 1993&hyphen;94 $1410.80 million, 1994&hyphen;95 $1483.70 million, 1995&hyphen;96 $1567.30 million, 1996&hyphen;97 $1445.80 and 1997&hyphen;98 $1429.90 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) I am aware of the claim by the Chief Executive of World Vision Australia, Mr Lynn Arnold, that a number of the agency's projects will not proceed because of cuts to the official aid program in 1997&hyphen;98. I understand that Mr Arnold's concerns are directed in particular at the decision not to proceed with the proposed Africa NGO Program (ANGOP).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Arnold's claim in respect of the World Vision projects is misleading. Total funds sought by non&hyphen;government organisations (NGOs) under ANGOP was over $34 million. This was almost four times the amount of money notionally available. In such a competitive environment there was no guarantee that any of the World Vision projects would have been funded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Funding available for the AusAID/NGO Cooperation Program (ANCP), the central NGO funding 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> mechanism, was increased by $3 million in the 1997/98 budget. World Vision will receive a significant proportion of these additional funds. It can allocate these funds to projects in Africa if it so chooses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">My Parliamentary Secretary, the Hon Andrew Thomson MP, and I responded to Mr Arnold's concerns, on 20 June 1997 and 22 July 1997 respectively.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Arnold wrote to me on 28 July regretting the capacity for misunderstanding in the World Vision commentary on the ANGOP decision.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) AusAID's records indicate that 44 charitable organisations wrote to me regarding cuts to the overseas aid program. These organisations were: Amnesty International, Anglican Board of Mission, Anglican Church Office (Synod), Archbishop of Melbourne's International Relief and Development Fund, Appropriate Technology for Community and Environment (APACE), AUSTCARE, Australian Baptist World Aid Inc, Australian Catholic Relief, Australian Council for Overseas Aid (ACFOA), Australian Executive Service Overseas Program (AESOP), Australian Lutheran World Service, Australian People for Health, Education and Development Abroad (APHEDA), Canberra PLANNERS, Christian Children's Fund, Community Aid Abroad, Family Planning Tasmania, Family Planning WA, Family Planning Australia, Global Education Centre, Global Learning Centre, Institute of Sisters of Mercy, Interplast Australia, Interserve Australia, International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF), Institute of Sisters of Mercy, International Women's Development Agency, Marist Mission Centre, National Council of Churches (Australia), Overseas Service Bureau, One World Learning Centre, Parramatta Diocesan Commission for Justice and Peace, Paulian Centre, PLAN International Australia, Quaker Service (NSW), Sudan Interior Mission (SIMAID), Tasmanian Council of Churches, TEAR Australia, Save the Children, World Vision Australia, National Council of Women of Australia, the Population Council, Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, World Wide Fund for Nature (Australia), and Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA).</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1997&hyphen;98 Budget:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) AusAID's records indicate that 12 charitable organisations wrote to me regarding cuts to the overseas aid program. These organisations were: Australian Council for Overseas Aid (ACFOA), Australian Expert Service Overseas Program (AESOP), African Enterprise, Australian Baptist World Service, Australian Lutheran World Service, Canberra PLANNERS, Community Aid Abroad (CAA), International Women's Development Agency, OZ Child, Quaker Service, World Vision Australia, and World Wide Fund for Nature.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) I met with ACFOA and World Vision during which representations were made to me regarding the 1997&hyphen;98 aid budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii) My response has been to note that Australia's aid budget, $1430 million in 1997&hyphen;98, is a very good outcome in the prevailing budgetary circumstances. Australia's Official Development Assistance (ODA) as a percentage of gross national product (GNP) is expected to be 0.27 per cent in 1997&hyphen;98, which is above the latest average for all Development Assistance Committee (DAC) donor countries (0.25 per cent in 1998). This is a considerable commitment to the reduction of poverty in developing countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 1996&hyphen;97 aid budget strengthened the overriding humanitarian focus of our aid program and the 1997&hyphen;98 budget builds on those changes. Assistance to NGOs through the AusAID&hyphen;NGO Cooperation Program (ANCP) will be increased in 1997&hyphen;98 by $3 million or nearly 20 per cent. This increase to the central NGO program in a reduced aid budget is a firm indication of the Government's commitment to a genuine partnership with NGOs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government indirectly supports NGOs by offering tax deductibility for financial contributions from members of the public to eligible agencies. This concession is estimated to cost up to $50 million annually in revenue forgone, and represents further recognition by the Government of the valuable role played by NGOs.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GJ4">Mr Warwick Smith</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Communications and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) (a) Commercial radio and television services are covered by their respective industry codes of practice. For commercial television the Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations Commercial Television Industry Code of Practice (FACTS Code) (Section 6) deals with the classification and placement of commercials and is intended to ensure that television commercials are classified and broadcast appropriately, in the light of current community attitudes and of the need to limit the exposure of children to material intended for adult viewing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The FACTS Code (Clause 7.2) provides that all written complaints about the content of television commercials (as distinct from their placement or the amount of commercials broadcast) will be referred to the Advertising Standards Council (which no longer exists) or, in the case of advertising directed to children, to the ABA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The FACTS Code has been reviewed and the revised Code is with the ABA for registration. I understand that the revised Code refers broadcasters to any relevant industry codes of practice and therefore for taste and decency matters in advertising members of the public will be able to complain to the new Advertising Standards Board announced by the Australian Association of National Advertisers on 28 August 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federation of Australian Radio Broadcasters (FARB) Commercial Radio Code of Practice covers advertising and also includes procedures on how the stations will handle complaints.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) (b) Part 11 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (the Act) provides for procedures for complaints about program content on commercial radio and television programs. Complaints alleging offences against the Act and breaches of licence conditions can be made direct to the Australian 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Broadcasting Authority (ABA). Complaints concerning program content or alleging breaches of codes of practice are made to the broadcaster in the first instance. If the broadcaster does not respond within 60 days or the response is inadequate, a complaint may be made to the ABA. The ABA is required to investigate provided the complaint is in good faith and is not frivolous or vexatious. Licensees are to provide regular on air information about the code and its complaints procedures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The FACTS Code (Clause 7.4) deals with procedures for handling oral complaints. It provides that licensees will record the substance of telephoned comments and to respond directly to callers who provide their name and contact details. Viewers who complain by telephone about material broadcast which is alleged to breach the code, and who wish to pursue the complaint further, are advised to complain in writing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Licensees are not obliged to respond to written complaints made more than 30 days after a broadcast (Clause 7.6). If the complaint is made within the 30 days period, licensees must seek to provide a substantive response within 10 working days. Where that is not possible, the licensee will undertake in writing to provide a substantive response within a further 20 working days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">If a complainant is not satisfied with a response to a written complaint, and raises the matter further in writing to the licensee, the licensee must either reply substantively to the further letter and advise the complainant that he or she may take the complaint to the ABA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the ABA's role to assess whether industry codes provide adequate safeguards, to judge the seriousness of a breach and decide on an appropriate course of action. If the ABA is satisfied that a code of practice is not operating to provide appropriate community safeguards or there is no code registered, the ABA may determine a standard (s.125 of the Act). Compliance with program standards is a condition of licence (Schedule 2).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the ABA finds that a breach of a code of practice has occurred, this does not represent a breach of licence condition nor of the Act. Compliance with codes is not a condition of licence unless the Authority imposes such a condition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ABA is also required to investigate alleged breaches of licence conditions set out in subclause 7(1) of Schedule 2 and has a range of sanctions available to it including penalties from $200,000 for commercial television licensees. However it is required to use its powers in a `a manner commensurate with the seriousness of the breach' (s.5(2)). Other options available include the imposing of a condition of licence on the broadcasters requiring compliance with the code of practice. The ABA can issue notices under s.141 and failure to comply 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8451"> may result in penalties ranging from $2M for a commercial television licensee to $50,000 for a commercial radio licensee. Under s.143 the ABA can suspend or cancel a licence and s.125 empowers the ABA to impose a program standard that would apply to all broadcasters in the sector. In addition, the Parliament may amend standards and codes under s.128.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The Government is not considering amendments to Part 11 of the Act. Changes to complaint procedures set out in industry codes of practice are a matter for the industry organisations representing the different broadcasting sectors, subject to the Act and registration by the ABA.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Under Australia's anti&hyphen;dumping legislation, action may be taken against dumped imports only if it can be established that such dumping has caused or threatens to cause material injury to an Australian industry producing like goods. Penalties may take the form of dumping duties or, under certain circumstances, the Minister may accept a price undertaking from the exporter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) In the case referred to in the article, dumping duties were sought by Faber&hyphen;Castell against highlighters dumped from Germany. In its report on this matter, the Anti&hyphen;Dumping Authority found that the goods had in fact been dumped, but that the Australian industry producing like goods (Faber&hyphen;Castell) had not suffered material injury caused by dumping and that there was not a threat of material injury from dumping of highlighters from Germany. As a result, the Authority recommended to the then Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs that no action be taken and the Minister accepted this recommendation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first point to make is that the lowering of the minimum income threshold for compulsory HECS repayment, while applying to all people with an outstanding HECS debt, is not a retrospective measure as it only applies to income earned from the 1997&hyphen;98 income year. While individuals with an outstanding HECS obligation will be required to commence repaying sooner, they will not face any increase in their outstanding HECS obligation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs has advised me that the number of individuals with an outstanding HECS debt who will earn an income in the 97&hyphen;98 income year which is above the minimum income threshold for compulsory HECS repayment is expected to rise by an estimated 156,722 to 409,038 as a result of the lowering of the minimum income threshold to $20,701.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, individuals with an outstanding HECS debt who have a spouse or dependent children, and who would otherwise be required to make repayments as a result of the lowering of the repayment threshold, will be exempt from making repayments if they receive an exemption or reduction of the Medicare levy because of low family income. This has the potential to benefit more than 14,000 people with an outstanding HECS obligation who would otherwise be expected to make a repayment in 1997&hyphen;98.</PARA>

In the same way, a school principal should declare an interest in applications from any staff member.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">With respect to members' personal relationships, an indirect pecuniary interest may involve, for example, an application for a consultancy or grant from a member's partner or relative, a close personal friend or a close professional colleague.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In cases where a member declares an indirect pecuniary interest, the prescribed body or relevant authority (as specified in Section 60) should determine the extent to which a member may be involved in the discussion or decision concerning the matter involving the potential conflict of interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">All declarations are to be recorded in the minutes of the relevant meeting.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Non&hyphen;pecuniary conflict of interest</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 60 does not cover actual or potential non&hyphen;pecuniary conflict of interest that may arise from a member simultaneously having an appointment to, or employment or consultancy or other involvement with, another organisation or body in some way involved with portfolio policies or programs. The situation may arise if the interests of NBEET and the other body or organisation are in conflict, or if access to information arising from NBEET membership could be used to unfair advantage if divulged to the other organisation or body. In certain circumstances the member may need to consider resigning NBEET membership, or severing links with the other organisation or body as appropriate, to avoid an ever present conflict of interest. In less extreme cases, the member may

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Avoiding a conflict of interest</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Board recognises that in certain specialised areas of research or consultancy, there may be a very limited number of individuals, project teams or organisations with the expertise and knowledge required. The above requirements for declaring an interest must nevertheless be applied if a conflict of interest actually arises or may be seen to have arisen. However, it may be possible to foresee a potential conflict of interest at some future time and to take steps to prevent it from actually arising.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, a steering committee or working party may decide to develop a brief for a consultancy or research project in an area in which a member of that committee/working party is expert. In such cases, the member may wish at the outset to state an inability to take any part either in developing the brief or in evaluating proposals received in response to it, thereby enabling her/him to tender for the project without conflict of interest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Declaration of financial interests</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Board and Council Chairs and Counsellors also declare any relevant financial interests on a prescribed form. These are retained in the custody of the Director of NBEET and are available for reference if required by the Minister or other authorised person.</PARA>
