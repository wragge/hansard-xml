<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I expect there to be robust debate in politics and in parliament. That is par for the course. I acknowledge that cartoons have a particular form and role to play in this country, but this one scrapes the bottom of the barrel. At no stage have I opposed or done other than to recognise that there is some concept, to be defined and dealt with properly, of native title. Indeed, after the original Mabo 1 decision of the High Court, I publicly recognised and accepted what the High Court had found.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yes, I have argued for extinguishment which validates pastoral leases, and this is a matter which is to be dealt with elsewhere.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This bill delivers on the government's commitment to maintain the export market development grants scheme and to provide full rate eligibility, for the first time, to the tourism industry. It simplifies the scheme, better targets its support to small and medium enterprises and retains a well funded program despite the budget black hole of the Labour government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The EMDG scheme has been assisting Australian exporters for over 22 years. During that time, the Export Market Development Grants Act 1974 has been amended many times. As a result the act is now quite complex and difficult to use, and has been criticised as such by exporters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill before the House is a very much easier to read document than the act it will replace. As far as is possible it puts like matters with like, it flows logically from subject to subject, and it presents concepts and terminology in relatively simple language. It uses around only half the number of words of the existing act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Two significant measures have been introduced to direct more funds to small and medium enterprise. The minimum expenditure threshold has been lowered to $20,000 per grant to benefit more SMEs. In addition, applicants with income in the grant year in excess of $50 million will no longer be eligible to receive a grant for that year, thus freeing up available funds for those exporters most in need of assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has also recognised the significant contribution made to our exports by the tourism industry. We have increased the grant rate for all tourism providers to the full rate of 50 per cent, allowing free samples of services provided and access to approved joint ventures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of the fiscal legacy of the previous Labour government, the cost of the EMDG scheme has also had to be addressed. The government has, therefore, decided to place a cap on annual funding. This is consis
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1522"> tent with the government's wider goal of fiscal restraint. Most importantly, the mechanism for effecting the cap will provide for full payment of smaller grants at the time of determination. Claimants eligible for larger grants will receive a partial advance at the time of determination and a pro&hyphen;rated balance at the end of the year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If demand for grants exceeds the $150 million available, larger grants will be reduced. To minimise the potential reduction to individual grants, the government has introduced a number of policy changes which will simplify the scheme, address fraud and better target it at those SMEs in the early years of exporting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Eligibility to claim air fares continues for the first two grants, assisting businesses take that difficult first step of visiting export markets. Air fares incurred by an overseas representative will continue to be claimable for all grant years within an overall expenditure cap for overseas representatives of $200,000 per grant year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fundamental principles of this scheme have not been altered. The scheme will continue to provide assistance to small and medium Australian exporters and potential exporters through the partial reimbursement of selected promotional costs. Under this bill, the scheme retains its open access nature.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the interests of broad consultation with industry and getting the bill right, an exposure draft of the bill was widely circulated late last year for public comment. Over 160 submissions were received. I thank those who provided submissions. Many of the issues raised in those submissions have been included in the bill that is before the House today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill demonstrates the commitment of the government to assisting Australian SMEs enter and develop export markets. Not only have we retained a well funded EMDG scheme which encourages smaller firms into export; we have made substantial progress towards reducing the budget deficit and providing a better macro&hyphen;economic environment for all Australian exporters. I commend the bill to the House. I also present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The government has introduced to this place a bill which will establish a revised and simplified export market development grants scheme. I refer to the Export Market Development Grants Bill 1997. This bill repeals the Export Market Development Grants Act 1974, and deals with matters arising from the repeal of that act and the enactment of Export Market Development Grants Act 1997. As a consequence of this change, it is necessary to protect the rights of certain applicants and the government, and the ongoing integrity of the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill preserves the status of approved body, approved joint venture and approved trading house applications, and various related guidelines; preserves first time claimant registration, and guidelines with respect to the grants entry test; preserves `decision making principles' in respect of continuing business considerations under the scheme; prevents first time applicants from claiming expenses in respect of previously ineligible services; ensures the finalisation of pending claim assessments and grant payments; ensures that pending prosecutions may continue, and monies owing to Austrade may be pursued; and amends other acts to reflect the repeal of the Export Market Development Grants Act 1974 and the enactment of the Export Market Development Grants Act 1997.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Aged Care Income Testing Bill 1997 is being tabled today in advance of the Aged Care Bill 1997 to establish an administrative procedure to support the implementation of the income testing arrangements that were part of the aged care reforms announced in the 1996 budget. The Aged Care Income Testing Bill will allow the departments of Social Security and Veterans' Affairs to commence income testing residents in nursing homes and hostels so that they can be advised by my department in advance of 1 July 1997 about the level of charges they will face when the Aged Care Bill is passed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill only enables an income assessment to be undertaken and advice to be provided to residents of the outcome of that assessment. It does not enable charges to be increased, nor does it allow any reduction in the level of Commonwealth subsidies paid under the National Health Act 1953 and the Aged or Disabled Persons Care Act 1954.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The substantive income testing provisions which would enable increased charges and corresponding reductions in subsidies will be provided for in the Aged Care Bill 1997. It is anticipated that the Aged Care Bill will also be tabled during this sitting with a commencement date of 1 July 1997. The provisions in this income testing bill would therefore cease to operate once the new aged care legislation is in force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill provides for an exchange of information between the Department of Health and Family Services and the departments of Social Security and Veterans' Affairs. The Department of Health and Family Services will
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> provide resident information to the other two departments who will match it to their records to retrieve information for those residents to enable the determination of ordinary income for those residents. Information will be provided to the Department of Health and Family Services under the relevant parts of the acts administered by those departments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are provisions in the bill to ensure that any personal information exchanged for the purpose of income testing is not used for any other purpose. These provisions have been developed in consultation with the Privacy Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The income test to be applied by the departments of Social Security and Veterans' Affairs is the existing test carried out in determining entitlements to pensions and benefits. The determination of income for people already in receipt of social security or veterans' affairs pensions or benefits will therefore be based on their existing available income information and they will not have to provide additional details. People will, however, be able to request a review of the determination if their circumstances have changed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Special protections for war widows and widowers have been built into the bill so that they will not pay any more than other people with an equivalent income. Nine per cent of current nursing home and hostel residents are non-pensioners. The Department of Social Security will undertake assessments for this group in order to ensure that they can be advised of their potential income tested charge as much in advance of 1 July as possible. The Department of Social Security will require three months prior to 1 July to undertake these necessary assessments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The income testing provisions in the Aged Care Income Testing Bill have therefore been introduced for passage in advance of the provisions in the Aged Care Bill to provide this necessary lead time. When income testing is in operation after 1 July only those who can afford to pay a little more and make a fair contribution will be asked to do so. Older people will not be asked to pay what they cannot afford for the resident aged care services they need.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1524">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People who are not satisfied with decisions made about their income will have a right of appeal, first to the relevant department and then to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal or the Social Security Appeals Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reforms announced in the 1996 budget will see far reaching changes to residential aged care services in Australia. The establishment of the administrative procedures provided for in this bill is essential to the government's overall strategy of providing residents with detailed information on the reforms and with certainty about the impact on their individual situation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The bill will put in place the necessary framework to give effect to the government's decision to sell AIDC Ltd and wind up the Australian Industry Development Corporation. AIDC's origins were in 1970 when the Australian Industry Development Corporation was established as a statutory corporation by the Commonwealth. It was formed to facilitate and encourage the establishment, development and advancement of Australian industries. Commercial operations commenced in 1971. The corporation established a reputation as a prominent development finance company in Australia, lending to and investing in a wide spectrum of Australian industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Milestone transactions in its development in the 1980s included leading roles in the North West Shelf gas project financing for Woodside Petroleum Ltd and the Eraring Power Station project financing. More recent significant transactions include establishing a consortium of institutional investors to take a 10
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> per cent equity interest in Optus Communications Pty Ltd.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The business activities of the Australian Industry Development Corporation were one of the first Commonwealth government activities identified for privatisation. This led to the decision by the previous government to establish AIDC Ltd to undertake the business activities of the corporation and enable an initial offering of 18.5 per cent of the shares to the public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although this approach provided for public participation in the ownership of the business, it did not provide a practical means through which the government was able to divest itself of the remainder of the company. As a consequence, it was necessary for the corporation to make a takeover offer for those shares in AIDC Ltd not owned by the corporation&mdash;that is, Commonwealth government owned shares&mdash;to facilitate the full disposal of the activity. The takeover offer was successfully completed in January 1996 and the shares in AIDC Ltd delisted from the Australian Stock Exchange in February 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since its establishment as a company, AIDC has been changing the direction of the business activity of the company. While still focusing on the development or advancement of the infrastructure and resource sectors of the economy, it is pursuing to a far greater extent fee based merchant banking business. This government is firmly of the view that such business activities have no place continuing in the public sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to moving the company from government ownership, the sale for which this bill provides the framework will further contribute to the government's competitive neutrality objectives. Through arrangements between the corporation and AIDC Ltd, AIDC was provided with access to funding at competitively attractive rates through the Commonwealth government guarantee. The termination of access to this facility will place the AIDC business on the same competitive footing as the rest of the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's decision to sell AIDC Ltd is consistent with the recommendations of the National Commission of Audit which considered that government business activities
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1525"> whose objectives are to provide goods and services on a commercial basis should only be retained in public ownership if there is a clear public interest case to do so. With the emergence and development of financial markets in Australia, any public interest case to retain AIDC in public ownership has disappeared. In reaching its decision, the government consulted with the board of the Australian Industry Development Corporation and AIDC Ltd. The directors and management of AIDC are fully supportive of the government's policy of privatising AIDC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The AIDC Sale Bill provides the necessary framework to give effect to the decision to sell AIDC Ltd. The bill provides for a flexible disposal strategy in recognition of the complexity of the legal and commercial arrangements that exist in AIDC Ltd and the need to take the appropriate measures in the sale process recognising the Commonwealth's position as guarantor of the corporation's borrowings. It enables the transfer, under ministerial direction, of assets of the corporation or any wholly owned entity of the corporation to the Commonwealth or any other body.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Provision is made for the winding&hyphen;up of the Australian Industry Development Corporation by proclamation, the timing of which is subject to written certification by the minister that he is satisfied that the corporation has no assets or liabilities. It is necessary to make this arrangement as the corporation will continue in existence after the sale of AIDC Ltd to satisfy the Commonwealth's guarantee obligations arising from the corporation's borrowing program. The corporation's 1996 annual report indicates that $946 million of the borrowings are due in five or more years, long after the sale of AIDC Ltd.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Schedule 1 of the bill provides for a range of amendments to the Australian Industry Corporation Act 1970 to give effect to a restriction of the further functions of the corporation to the core functions. These include the facilitation and encouragement of the establishment, development and advancement of Australian industries through the provision of financial resources and securing participation by Australian residents in the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ownership and control of businesses. While it is the government's view that such objectives should be carried on in future by private entities, it is important to maintain these core functions of the corporation in relation to the existing obligations. Further changes are included to provide for the minister to give directions to the board of the corporation. Through this power the minister can require the corporation to manage the wind down of its liabilities, consistent with the government's decision to sell the business activities of the corporation and the ultimate objective of abolishing the corporation when it no longer has any assets or liabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A range of amendments to the act are proposed to provide for the variation to the composition of the corporation's board. It removes the requirement for the ex officio appointment of secretaries to departments as this is no longer appropriate given the ongoing functions of the corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the sale of AIDC Ltd, as provided for by this bill, the close linkage between AIDC Ltd and the Australian Industry Development Corporation will no longer exist and, as a consequence, it is necessary to amend the existing legislation to ensure that the restrictions on the delegation of powers by the corporation to an officer or employee who remains in the corporation or to a fully&hyphen;owned subsidiary of the corporation remain applicable in the context of the other changes proposed for the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Section 24A of the existing act is repealed and replaced by a provision that permits the minister to give the corporation written direction to pay specified amounts to the Commonwealth at specified times. Under the existing provisions, payments to the Commonwealth were precluded from exceeding the corporation's profit in that year. Within the sale environment and the wind down in the corporation, it is important for the Commonwealth as the beneficial owner to capture the proceeds at its determination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A new part VI is inserted into the Australian Industry Development Corporation Act 1970 to provide the flexible framework that will enable the sale to take place. The framework includes the regularisation of the owner
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1526"> ship of AIDC Ltd, the introduction of the government's ability to transfer assets and liabilities between different elements of AIDC or to the Commonwealth, the ability of the Commonwealth to direct to it the payment of the proceeds of the sale or sales, and the abolition of any residual franking credits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill includes provisions relating to transfer of minority interests in AIDC Ltd. Although there was a successful takeover offer by the corporation for those AIDC Ltd shares not owned by the corporation, two parcels of shares in the company remain outside the corporation's ownership. This gives rise to the situation where, despite the corporation, and through it the Commonwealth, having beneficial ownership of 99.98 per cent of the company, it can be frustrated in its intentions to pursue the sale of the company. Obligations are generated under the Corporations Law for directors of the company to protect the interests of those minority shareholders. While this bill makes specific arrangements for the compulsory acquisition of minority interests, the threshold at which it can operate reflects provisions in Corporations Law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill provides for the Minister for Finance to declare that at a specified date, which must be before 1 July 1998, that the legal and beneficial interests in those shares vest in the corporation. The shareholders involved are protected in the bill by a requirement on the corporation that reasonable compensation be paid for the shares, with recourse being provided to the Federal Court if agreement cannot be reached on the amount of compensation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As part of its business activities, AIDC Ltd has built up a range of significant investment holdings. Important amongst these is the 48.5 per cent holding in the Australian Submarine Corporation. This holding was able to be managed in a way that contributed not only to the development of Australian industry but also to the development of Australian resources necessary for our defence. With the sale of AIDC Ltd, the government is concerned to ensure that this significant ownership stake in ASC continues to be held in a way that contributes to Australia's defence
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> industry objectives. As a result, this asset will be quarantined from sale, unless there is a compelling argument brought forward from the Department of Defence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For this reason, the bill makes provision for the Minister for Finance to direct the transfer of the assets in a way that allows for the transfer of particular assets, such as the interest in ASC, and assists in achieving the government's objective of a sale of the business of AIDC Ltd. Associated with the power to transfer assets, authority is also provided for the transfer of contractual rights and obligations and liabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of the liabilities of AIDC and its subsidiaries involve liabilities taken on by the Australian Industry Development Corporation and, therefore, include a guarantee of the payment by the Commonwealth of Australia. Provision is made in the bill for the continuation of that guarantee of payment when the liability is transferred to another person. Following the declaration of a sale day, AIDC Ltd and its subsidiaries will have no further recourse to raising new funds which are guaranteed by the Commonwealth. These changes will not permit the purchaser of AIDC assets, rights, obligations or liabilities to in any way change the nature of the existing obligations and retain the benefit of the Commonwealth guarantee. The guarantee will only continue to apply only while the liability remains in exactly the same form as existed at the time of sale.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Provision is made for the Minister for Finance to direct that the proceeds from the sale or transfer of assets of AIDC bodies must be paid to the Commonwealth. This is to ensure that the Commonwealth obtains the full benefit of the sale of AIDC or any subsidiary bodies at the time of the sale rather than leaving it to the discretion of the corporation or an AIDC company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill sets out the stamp duty liabilities applying in the sale, specifying that it is not payable in relation to those transfers of assets or liabilities between AIDC bodies or between AIDC Ltd and the Commonwealth, which arise as a result of ministerial direction; such directions being provided for in this legisla
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1527"> tion. It also provides that stamp duty will not be payable in relation to the sale itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also provides in Division 7 for the cancellation of AIDC's franking credits, as their inclusion in the sale process could result in the Commonwealth achieving only partial return for the credits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">New sections are introduced to provide that AIDC companies must provide information or other assistance as may be requested in writing by the minister to pursue the sale process. In providing this power, protection is provided to those giving information or assistance to ensure that such actions do not result in a contravention of the Corporations Law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Importantly, the bill provides for the preservation or other recognition of entitlements of AIDC staff. It preserves accrued long service leave entitlements and ensures that the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act continues to apply in relation to injury or loss incurred before sale day. In these respects, the bill reflects the past practice of government in protecting accrued rights of employees in asset sale situations. The bill also makes consequential amendments to a number of other Commonwealth acts which will take effect on the winding up of the Australian Industry Development Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill will provide a framework for the sale of AIDC Ltd and the subsequent winding up of the Australian Industry Development Corporation in the most flexible and expeditious way in response to commercial interest that is expressed in the sale process. It will also protect the interests of AIDC employees and enable the effective disposition of assets, liabilities, rights and obligations. I present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation will foster a more open and competitive environment in the provision of hearing aids. It does so by delineating clearly the hitherto dual role of the Hearing Services Administration, HSA. Until now, the HSA has acted as both service provider and regulator, the result being that the hearing services industry has been monopolised by a government satellite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The HSA was the only winner under the current practice. Private audiologists and audiometrists and hearing impaired persons clearly were the losers. For the first time, private providers will be able to compete with the HSA on a more level playing field. Most importantly, consumers will benefit because the legislation will see an increase in competition while providing safeguards to ensure that they are not exploited.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Until now, the hearing impaired and deaf community have basically had only two options when it came to the fitting and servicing of hearing instruments. After waiting in lengthy queues at one of the clinics of Aus
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1528"> tralian Hearing Services, those who qualified for a hearing aid from the government were fitted with a fairly basic model, at no expense to themselves. Those who did not qualify for a free government supplied hearing aid could be fitted with an aid of their choice by a private audiologist or audiometrist of their selection. However, these clients were not entitled to any form of rebate, either from Medicare or from a private health fund, if they chose to consult a private practitioner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There appears to have been a glaring inequity in that patients could receive a rebate for the services they received from other health professionals&mdash;including physiotherapists, podiatrists and optometrists&mdash;yet a similar rebate did not apply to the field of audiology. Unfortunately, this inequity will not be corrected in the proposed legislation. However, if the coalition government is truly committed to promoting more comparative equality, if it is truly committed to a market driven health industry, this is something that must be resolved in the near future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These bills will see the introduction of a voucher system as central to the administration of the distribution of hearing instruments. The explanatory memoranda accompanying the bills reveal that the vouchers will entitle users to one or more hearing services. These include the assessment for, and the fitting of, hearing devices. The government also asserts that it will extend to the follow&hyphen;up servicing of a client, which is an integral part of treating those with hearing loss.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These vouchers will allow consumers to take a greater responsibility in the decision making process. An individual who meets the government's criteria may decide to use his or her voucher to purchase a fundamental style of hearing instrument that meets federal government basic specifications. Alternatively, the consumer may now opt for a more sophisticated form of hearing aid and pay the balance between the cost of the aid and the value of the voucher. In the past, many clients who received free hearing aids from the HSA discarded them because of their basic design and performance. Many then chose to pay for an upgraded device, leaving the old aid to sit and gather dust. Given that governments have
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> only limited funds to dedicate to the health industry, that is not good economic practice in anyone's language.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The explanatory memorandum accompanying the principal bill says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department will also enter into arrangements with suppliers of hearing aids . . . to ensure that participants have access to suitable devices at a reasonable cost to government, and to ensure high standards are maintained.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">On first glance, this appears to be a reasonable inclusion. However, the legislation is dollar driven. It is predicated on the grounds of budget neutrality. Clause 8 of the explanatory memorandum states that the administrators of the voucher system will, as a matter of priority, `take into consideration the limited resources available to provide services and programs and will thus strive to ensure the most effective use of funds'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a concern in the industry that the planned agreements between the government and manufacturers will restrict consumer choice and result in a form of vertical integration in the distribution of hearing aids. Ms Pam Gabriels, the Director of Western Hearing Services Pty Ltd, has said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important to ensure a full choice to the consumer of providers and products. We do not want to end up with a chain of manufacturers tied up with an existing retail outlet.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">She goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill discusses an arrangement between the department and manufacturers. We would like to ensure that an independent body evaluates all technology and we would like that to be written into the bill.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Ms Gabriels's comments are echoed by Mr Marshall Smithers, the Vice President of the Hearing Aid Manufacturers and Distributors Association. Mr Smithers said that it is important that the new legislation does not restrict the access of hearing impaired persons to the full range of technology available from different manufacturers. Mr Smithers indicated that it is just as important that the amendments do not hinder the hearing impaired from making full use of the large number of small service providers in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that this legislation will provide consumers with an improved level of choice.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1529"> But it is equally true that projected funding levels are likely to be inadequate to sustain the new voucher system for long. Some industry experts have gone so far as to forecast that current funding will run out halfway through the year if the government is serious about meeting its commitment to its stated objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A likely outcome of this legislation is that the government will link up with the larger manufacturers and distributors in an effort to drive down the price of hearing devices and so spread the restricted funds further. Smaller but nevertheless worthy private providers could find it difficult to compete in such an environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A lack of funds is also likely to periodically lead to an increase in the already long waiting queues. This is another reason why the government should appoint an autonomous body to scrutinise the performance of all hearing devices and not just those made available by the larger manufacturers. It is appropriate for the HSA to continue to provide special services for those living in remote and rural areas and this legislation accommodates the continuation of that practice. However, I am concerned that other groups have been singled out and excluded from the new voucher system in what is a transparent attempt to limit the dollars committed to this scheme. The hearing impaired and deaf community are, by the very nature of their affliction, at a disadvantage to those with full hearing capacity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To exempt young people between the ages of 18 and 21 from this scheme discriminates against a group which is already facing significant hurdles. A good number of those within this age bracket are full&hyphen;time students while some are unemployed. In answering a question on notice on 3 December 1996, the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) referred to these young hearing impaired people as an `equity target group'. Arguably, these are the people who can least afford to pay for hearing aids, yet they are being excluded from the government's voucher system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Deafness Council of Western Australia sees the exclusion of 18&hyphen; to 21&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds from
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this scheme as a major flaw in an otherwise welcome piece of legislation, so too does the Speech and Hearing Centre for deaf children in Western Australia, located within my own electorate. Ms Karen Vernard, the principal of the centre, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like to register my protest against the change of age for eligibility of children from 18 to 21 . . . Most of our children are attending courses and studying up to 21 years of age and are not financially independent.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The issue of inequity is also being levelled against the  exclusion of some senior citizens from the voucher program. The legislation will see that anyone who is on a part or full age pension will have access to the vouchers while self-funded retirees are excluded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the one hand, the government is encouraging ordinary Australians to provide for themselves in their retirement by promoting the benefits of superannuation schemes. On the other hand, these same people are being excluded from receiving the benefits and services made available to those who are reliant on the state in their twilight years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Private practitioners argue that many elderly clients on the pension are not only able but also willing to pay for their hearing aids. It has been suggested by some that either the provision of services be cut to part pensioners or co-payments by pensioners be introduced as a means of increasing the total funding of the scheme. Private audiologists and audiometrists are also concerned that the proposed voucher system does not extend to single mothers who support hearing impaired dependants but who do not rely on a pension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am aware of a particular gentleman who will no longer be entitled to assistance from the government, despite the fact that he suffers from profound hearing loss. This man supports a family and has a mortgage. He meets his tax obligations. He does not wish to go on a pension but wants to remain a productive member of the work force. Because he is over the age of 18 and because he does not hold a pension or health benefits card, he will not qualify for help under the new voucher system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In short, many professionals question whether the government has successfully
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1530"> targeted the most needy equity groups in the hearing impaired community under the new program. Some audiologists also believe that the bill fails to take into account the extensive nature of rehabilitation. They observe that the assessment of hearing loss and the fitting of hearing aids alone do not equate to a total care package. Of equal importance is the ongoing care of a client after the appropriate hearing instrument has been fitted. Just as the technology behind hearing aids continues to improve, so too does that of rehabilitation. The services of the hearing impaired are becoming more comprehensive, more complex and more time consuming, but the cost of total care of hearing impaired persons, as opposed to just fitting the device, is not accommodated under the proposed voucher system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has again been some suggestion that the government will monitor service top-ups provided by private practitioners in order to avoid the overservicing of clients. So much for a less intrusive government. The government has ensured that ample safeguards feature in the bill to protect consumers once the voucher system becomes operative. Clauses 17 and 18 set out very clearly the rules of conduct for private practitioners. The bill is equally as specific in outlining the penalties for non-compliance with these rules of conduct. Arrangements are in place to allow consumers to make a formal complaint about the standard of service they receive from service providers. These are all thoughtful and valuable inclusions. They should not preclude the need for the government to conduct any investigations into servicing levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As one private practitioner has observed, the opening up of the industry to competition will mean that consumers play a big part in the success of individual clinics. Put simply, if service providers are good, they are likely to benefit from return business and the referral of their names from one client to another. If a private practitioner offers poor levels of service, they can expect a decline in business. There is no need for the government to be talking too much about investigating standards of service.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All in all, the Hearing Services Administration Bill 1997 and its associated legislation are worthy pieces. Its essence will see improved levels of competition in a service previously dominated by a government body. Without exception, the feedback my office has received from private practitioners has been in support of the bill. But the support has been qualified. Private audiologists and audiometrists look forward to being able to compete in a more market driven industry. But they are concerned about inequities that have been created by the government's criteria on eligibility. They are also concerned with the lack of information relating to the nature of the agreements the government will enter into with manufacturers. These understandable reservations deserve clarification by the government in the very near future.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To commence, I think it is appropriate to take the House through some of the actual provisions of the Hearing Services Administration Bill 1997, which we are now debating. This bill establishes a voucher system for the provision of government funded hearing services from 1 July. The intention of that is to give adults with a hearing loss a choice of service provider. The outline of the bill talks about introducing managed competition within and between the private sector and the government provider of hearing services, with greater industry involvement in self-regulation and standards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Within the bill we find: a scheme for the accreditation of suitable service providers, including the current government provider, Australian Hearing Services; rules of conduct for service providers; and rules surrounding the nature, extent and use of the vouchers. Other arrangements with service providers are to be dealt with through contractual arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Administration of the voucher system is likely to be delegated by the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) to the department. Under that delegation, the department will primarily issue the vouchers to eligible adults who qualify to be participants in the system, it will accredit appropriate bodies as providers of hearing services to
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1531"> those people who are issued with a voucher, and it will provide advice relating to hearing services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently government funded hearing services are provided through Australian Hearing Services. If we look further into the bill, and the notes on clauses, it talks about contracted service providers&mdash;that is, service providers who have been approved under the accreditation scheme and who have entered into a contract to provide hearing services to voucher holders. We see hearing services defined as the services and goods provided for hearing rehabilitation, assessment of hearing or hearing loss prevention. Goods will include hearing aids and related devices. The bill says it is envisaged that most hearing loss prevention will still be undertaken by Australian Hearing Services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the issue of eligible persons, the bill does not include eligibility for Commonwealth seniors card holders. That removal was announced in the 1996&hyphen;97 budget. I may have the opportunity to return to that issue later on in the debate but, if not, I indicate at this point that I think that the removal of eligibility for Commonwealth seniors health card holders is a very shabby provision indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am most concerned about a bill which introduces this element of deregulation and encourages the private sector provision of health services because of my experience with a couple of what I would only describe as bogus hearing test companies and companies which have provided hearing services in Victoria and&mdash;I am led to believe&mdash;even interstate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have had over 100 complaints from people in my electorate about the activities of two of these companies, which go by the names of Ear Care and Better Care, which have contacted people at their home through the use of telemarketers inviting them to come for free hearing tests, luring them with the promise of extravagant amounts of compensation from their former employers for industrial deafness, offering them hearing aids and the like to provide hearing services, but ultimately ripping them off, often for amounts like $250 or even $400 or, in more extreme cases, thousands of dollars.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been approached not only by people who have been the victims of this scam but also by telemarketers involved in the operation who subsequently came to realise that they were involved with an improper organisation. These telemarketers were told to tell the people they rang that, if they suffered a hearing loss due to work force participation of even as little as one per cent, they were entitled to some form of compensation. In Victoria that is not the case. For better or worse, there is legislation in Victoria which establishes a seven per cent threshold before a person can make a claim for work related hearing loss. The telemarketers were told not to mention any costs or money and, if they were queried about scams, people were to be told, `You do have to pay $250 but, if the claim is not proceeded with, you will get it refunded.' In fact, these people did not have their money refunded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the telemarketers, Ms Lorraine Crupi, was so convinced by the company's representations that she even organised for her own mother to come in and have a test. Her mother was told by the consultant that she had a strong case for compensation so she should pay over the $250 so they could proceed. Subsequently, she received a letter from the Ear Care solicitors seeking a further $150, which she sent off. Then she received a report back from the solicitors saying it would not be wise to proceed because her hearing loss was not substantial enough and they had therefore closed her file. There was no mention of any refund and the medical report that they referred to was dated 26 July, a date at which the solicitors had the report in their possession when they sent the letter to her saying that she had a good case for compensation. When she sought a refund, she received a further letter which put her on an absurd treadmill from which it was simply impossible for her ever to get a decision out of the company about refunding her money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At various times the telemarketers were told by their supervisors that they did not come over strongly enough and that if they did not get in more people the telemarketing operation would close. They were told that it was better to contact people with ethnic names
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1532"> from ethnic backgrounds. They were told, `Australians know better.' The telemarketers were told that if they were queried about hearing loss scams they were to say, `Oh, that involves other companies. We are a branch of WorkCover.' Indeed, some of the telemarketers thought that statement was true. They were told to say, `This is an accredited part of WorkCover,' or `We are authorised by the government to conduct these tests.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This second telemarketer also said to me that people were told to ring people from non&hyphen;English speaking backgrounds. The supervisors said, `Concentrate on ethnic names. Australians will not claim. They know how the system works.' Indeed, our system has no need of companies like Ear Care or Better Care and people can get hearing tests at their doctor's surgery or community health centres without having to pay for them. If they have a legal right to compensation, they can pursue that through recognised lawyers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once you come in for a test from one of these companies,  you are seen by a consultant who is paid by commission. For example, they get $120 for every claim that goes through. Those consultants do not have any qualifications. You or I, Mr Deputy Speaker, could become consultants for Ear Care. The commission basis for payment means that there is simply no incentive for them to be honest even if they do have the capacity to measure hearing loss. The consultants told people that compensation would be automatic, that any problems were only due to a government backlog. They were also told to tell people who were in the work force, some of whom were worried about making claims on their present employers, that their employers would never find out about their claims. That was nonsense. Nevertheless, that was what they were told to tell prospective customers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a disgraceful way of doing business. I want to indicate to the House a few more examples of how they have conducted themselves. A Mr and Mrs Cavaleri of Hope Street, Brunswick, told the company Better Care that their employers were no longer trading and that they had no documents to prove they had ever been employed there. But a Mr Peter Adamopoulos from Better Care
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> assured both of them that they had cause to seek damages. He said it did not matter that their employers were no longer trading. But, once they had paid over $500, they were told by Better Care's solicitors, Behan and Speed, that, if they could not provide any proof of employment and if their employers were no longer trading, they would not be able to make a successful claim.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A Mr Calvano of Denys Street, Fawkner, was told he had a 58 per cent hearing loss and would be able to claim compensation for sure. Once he paid over his $250, however, he was referred to a specialist who told him that his hearing loss was not work related, but due to the ageing process. A Mrs Rad of St Albans paid over $250 to Better Care at St Albans after being told she had a substantial hearing loss and would be able to claim $2,500 in compensation from her former employer. She raised the issue of proof of employment and was told by her consultant that, given her level of hearing loss, she would have no difficulty claiming compensation. But then Behan and Speed, the Better Care solicitors, told her there was no point in pursuing her case because she had not kept any records showing that she had been employed at the relevant time. Of course, as the relevant time was many years ago, it is not surprising that she did not keep any records. Nevertheless, Better Care and their solicitors refused to refund her $250. That is the kind of company of that Better Care has been.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ear Care in most respects have been even worse. They told people that they would have a successful claim. When those people handed over their money, they were later told that their hearing loss was not compensable. When Mrs Concetta Rocco asked Ear Care to discontinue her claim and refund her money, they refused to do that&mdash;they kept going anyway. It is not only the companies that have acted badly; it is the solicitors they have acting on their behalf. For example, a Mr Lindus of Coghlan Street, Niddrie, paid over $250 to Ear Care and then $150 to Anthony Raso and Associates. He received a letter from Anthony Raso and Associates before paying over that $150. It said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1533">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The evidence to date suggests you have a very strong case and very likely a successful claim.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">But, once he had paid over that money, he received a letter in June saying that his claim would be unsuccessful. It suggested that he no longer pursue his claim, and said that the company was closing its file. Mr Lindus pointed out to me that he was not tested for hearing loss between 13 and 28 June. One wonders on what basis the solicitors changed their assessment from likely eligibility to ineligibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have had a procession of cases of this kind where people were told before they paid over their money, `Yes, you'll be able to make a successful claim.' But after they paid over their money they were told, `No, you don't have any entitlement to make a claim.' I have spent a great deal of time seeking refunds on behalf of those people. I spent three hours one day with a Mr Trevor McTaggart from Ear Care. I was able to secure a couple of refunds. But I have got to say that he is one of the biggest conmen I have ever met. He says he is an ex&hyphen;builders labourer and that he is on the workers' side. That is a lot of garbage. Exploiting retired people of Italian, Greek, Lebanese and Arabic&hyphen;speaking backgrounds has nothing whatsoever to do with being on the side of workers. It is a shameful way to earn a living.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have come across examples of letters from solicitors. I have got one here which has on the top of the letterhead `Vernons Barristers and Solicitors'. It is addressed to a Mr Wilkins in Airport West, telling him that they are closing their file. On the bottom it is signed `Yours faithfully, Anthony Raso and Associates', an entirely different firm of solicitors. What an appalling situation. This is the kind of operation which these private sector operators have been running.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In late 1995, I received advice from an impeccable source about the Ear Care operation. I went straight to the fraud squad. I did so because it indicated to me, beyond any shadow of a doubt, two things which I had strongly suspected based on the case histories of so many constituents that I had seen being taken down: first, that Ear Care were sending out letters routinely&mdash;not inadvertently;
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> routinely&mdash;and as a matter of policy to people telling them that they were ready to proceed further with their claim, had the results of the tests and so on, and asking people for $250 or, in cases where they had already received $250 and were feeling greedy, asking for another $150 when they had the hearing test results and knew perfectly well that their client did not have sufficient hearing loss to make a valid legal claim. This is straight up and down fraud: making representations to someone to hand over money to you so that they can get compensation when you know perfectly well that they are never going to get any compensation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second disgraceful thing is this: the two firms of solicitors who were supposed to be doing legal work for Ear Care&mdash;Anthony Raso and Associates and Vernons&mdash;were actually only handling a handful of cases. The vast majority of cases were being processed from start to finish in Ear Care's head office using massive quantities of Anthony Raso's letterhead and Vernon's letterhead to deceive clients into thinking that their cases were being handled by lawyers so they would part with more money. This is, as MPs would know, not only a breach of the legal profession's monopoly on the provision of legal services but also gross professional misconduct on the part of those two law firms which allowed Ear Care, no doubt for a fee, to use their name. The whole operation was bogus. Ear Care's head office had a number of phone lines in it. Staff were told, `If lines A, B and C ring, you are to answer "Ear Care"; if line D rings, you are to answer "Vernon's"; if line E rings, you are to answer "Anthony Raso and Associates".' The more I learned about that scam the more incredulous I became. I even made inquiries to satisfy myself that Vernon's and Anthony Raso actually existed and were not a complete legal fiction&mdash;a figment of the imagination of those who run Ear Care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those legal firms do exist but they should not. I have advised the Law Institute about their conduct. In my view, they should have been struck off by now. To the best of my knowledge, they have not been. It is little wonder that the legal profession does not
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1534"> enjoy a better reputation. The fraud squad and the Victorian WorkCover Authority eventually carried out raids on Ear Care and seized their files. At about the same time Ear Care went into external administration. It is pretty reasonable to assume that the raids were the cause of the company going out of business. I congratulate the WorkCover Authority for doing that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Late last year the Victorian government also initiated legislation amending the Accident Compensation Act, which inserted a new section of prohibited conduct concerning touting for claims. To the best of my knowledge, that legislation has also been useful in stamping out this rort, and it too is welcome. These acts, however, have not achieved any refunds for the hundreds, and probably thousands, of Victorians ripped off by these companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A group called the Public Interest Law Clearing House contacted me in 1995 about pursuing a class action on behalf of the victims of Ear Care. Through a great deal of hard effort and commitment on the part of Ms Caitlin English of the Public Interest Law Clearing House and Mr Michael Piu, who worked for me during 1996, dozens of claims for refund were lodged with the Small Claims Tribunal. With Ear Care going into bankruptcy, it seems that very few, if any, of these people will ever get their money back. I do not walk away for one moment from the role that I played in putting Ear Care out of business, because there is no doubt that, for every case we lodge with the Small Claims Tribunal, their telemarketers were luring another 10 people to hand over their money for the pot of gold on the other side of the rainbow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am distressed that so many people have been so cold&hyphen;bloodedly ripped off and that those low life who ran Ear Care, Trevor McTaggart, Mark Fisher and Andrew Newland, are still out there walking the streets. They should be charged, and the sooner the better. I am also concerned that these people will try to get themselves into the business of hearing services. They have been there before. They have set up new companies at the drop of a hat with names
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> like National Hearing Services, not unlike the name of the Commonwealth's own service provider, and they have been in the business of supplying hearing aids and the like. Notwithstanding the provisions in this bill for accreditation and for ensuring that those engaged in providing hearing services are quality providers, I am concerned that we have people out there who may seek to abuse these new provisions. I want to express my concern about those issues to the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I further understand that this problem is not confined to Victoria. For example, in June last year there was a report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> referring to the New South Wales Law Society seeking to recover up to $30 million in fees paid by 20,000 people to Better Care, which is described as a Melbourne based company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is most important that if this legislation is to proceed&mdash;the opposition has many concerns about its provisions&mdash;the minister can guarantee that the quality of hearing aids is going to remain state&hyphen;of&hyphen;the&hyphen;art, that the clients are not going to be subjected to co-payments and that the government is not going to further undermine Australian Hearing Services by moving to privatise it. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was interesting to hear the contribution from the member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson) because it simply highlights my concerns with the Hearing Services Administration Bill 1997 and the Hearing Services and AGHS Reform Bill 1997. I come forward to discuss these bills with some interest in the matter because during the last government I was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health and I had direct ministerial responsibility for both the Australian Hearing Services and the Australian Government Health Service. I was involved in the administration of both of these areas. I know a lot about what has happened and I am gravely concerned about these bills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am gravely concerned about these bills for many reasons. Let me begin with the Australian Government Health Service. When you read the four or five paragraphs in the second reading speech and the slight comment given
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1535"> in the budget speech last year on this matter, you wonder whether the government has even begun to think what this is all about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for the actual functions of the Australian Government Health Service and the way it has operated, the government is proposing to effectively set up the Australian Government Health Service as a separate government business enterprise. If you are going to set up a separate government business enterprise that is going to employ doctors and carry out medical practice, one has to ask: is this some form of socialisation in medicine? Will this body be able to get work in all areas of medicine? Is that the idea? Will the Australian Government Health Service be able to compete against private doctors in all areas of medicine or will it be limited in some way about which we have not been told?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The main task of the Australian Government Health Service at the moment, as the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) said in the second reading speech, is to provide mainly health assessment services for Commonwealth clients. That is what it has been doing. Why should you then take this unit, which is operating quite efficiently at the moment, and turn it into a government enterprise? Is it the intention of the government to go from that point to the point in which this body will be able to offer a whole variety of health services and compete with private practitioners? I wonder what will happen with this. Will the doctors who are employed in it also be able to have individual Medicare arrangements?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not clear at all what the government intends to do in this whole area. What we had was an efficient unit doing a  specific job, and the government, in its whole privatisation push, has suddenly decided that it wants to make it into a government enterprise. If it does, the question will then be: will it remain a government enterprise? Obviously it will not because the intention is, firstly, to make it into a government enterprise and, secondly, to very quickly sell it to private enterprise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If that is the intention, it should have been stated in the bill, and the government should have been honest enough to have done so. If that is what the intention is, one wonders
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> what will happen to the current specialised function of the Australian Government Health Service. It currently has a very good ability to assess people, especially immigration applicants. We have a specialist body, and the first step is to make it into a government enterprise and the next step is to try to sell it off. Obviously the conservatives will not maintain such a body for any significant period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So that whole expertise, useful expertise, in very speedily assessing people in the Commonwealth service, people who apply for positions in the Commonwealth service, migration applicants and other people who need to be assessed for whatever reason for the Commonwealth and even state government departments will be lost. This is another half&hyphen;baked idea from the government, but I guess it is to be expected from a conservative government. One wonders where it will go from here? We certainly need more answers from the government and the minister about these issues when this debate concludes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now turn to another aspect of the legislation which is much more disturbing in some respects: the changes to Australian Hearing Services administration and to hearing services generally. The first thing that needs to be said is that Australian Hearing Services is and has been recognised as the best hearing services organisation in the world&mdash;I repeat: in the world! During the time I was involved in the AHS administration it received accolades internationally for its work. People came from a variety of countries to study the work of Australian Hearing Services. And why was that? Because in every area of its work it was outstanding, and it remains outstanding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One has to ask: if we have an outstanding public organisation that is doing its job, why change it and corporatise it? It is so that afterwards, when it suits the conservative government, they can flog it off. Of course, they say that is not their intention for the moment, but we know what their real intentions are whenever they corporatise an organisation in this way. I will come back to the rationalisation for this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is Australian Hearing Services has been doing an outstanding job, firstly, in
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1536"> its provision of low cost hearing aids for the Australian population. It has one of the lowest costs in the world. Secondly, just as dramatically, Australian Hearing Services has been involved in joint ventures to produce a significant number of hearing aids in Australia and it has been involved in Australian research which has contributed to dealing with deafness on a world scale. We have this organisation with this reputation, and what is this government going to do? It is going to destroy it! That is what it is going to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a shameful bill. It is part of the government's ideological obsession that anything in the public sector cannot be efficient, cannot be competitive and cannot be good&mdash;notwithstanding the overwhelming evidence that Australian Hearing Services is one of the best examples of a public body doing an excellent job in this country. Indeed, I used to say to people who commented that we could never have a public body or public organisation providing an efficient service that the AHS is an example of one doing just that. The AHS has been providing an efficient service through its many offices around Australia, and people are delighted with the service. They are so delighted that even people who were not eligible for the service were wanting to use their services. That is how good it was!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead of the government bringing in these provisions, they should be bringing in the provisions that I suggested when I was parliamentary secretary. They included allowing people who are not eligible to use the services of AHS free of charge to pay to use the services. A lot of people wanted to pay for the services of AHS. That is how good it was and still is. Instead, the government want to, disgracefully, corporatise AHS with a view, of course, to selling it off down the track. What is the rationalisation for this? It is entirely ideological. It has to do with so&hyphen;called competition policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very interesting to note that whenever it suits this government they are into competition policy. Whenever it does not suit them&mdash;like in the ownership of the Australian media, for example; one of the key issues facing this country&mdash;suddenly competition policy is no
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> longer around. But, in this case, as I mentioned, we have this excellent organisation and suddenly the government have discovered competition policy as a way of dismantling this organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Wills mentioned something very important: some of the private organisations that existed in the hearing aids area were behaving disgracefully and the AHS had some control in the contracts that were being given out. So some people in their greedy behaviour, which was outlined in great detail by the member for Wills, behaved very badly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is this government going to do? It is going to open up this area to this kind of exploitation. It is not as if the AHS was not allowing private providers. But I point out that most of the hearing aids given by private providers were being imported, whereas the AHS is producing hearing aids in Australia. From any point of view&mdash;whether you are looking at it from the national interest point of view, from an efficiency point of view or from a justice point of view&mdash;this bill is a nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this context, the government is not only going to be involved in dismantling the one body, the good body, the AHS, but also going to have to create another body called the Office of Hearing Services. Why does it have to create this body? In order to bring in the private sector, it has to have a body that is going to supervise the AHS and the private operators. So you have a system that is working well at the moment being dismantled and you are going to have to now establish a further body. In the second reading speech is this ridiculous statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is anticipated that the new voucher arrangements and the changes in operations for Australian Hearing Services will be implemented without additional costs to the taxpayer.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What a nonsense. What rubbish. How are they going to establish the new Office of Hearing Services without additional cost? Who is going to pay for this new office? Isn't it going to be paid for by the people getting their hearing aids or by the taxpayers? The claim that there are no additional costs is a nonsense. I have never seen such a half&hyphen;baked
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1537"> proposal as this proposal in relation to Australian Hearing Services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to this, as if this was not enough, what happens? The government comes in with a second whack. It is not only going to corporatise the body but also going to reduce people's benefits. The AHS was distinguished by its ability to supply these services to the Australian people, those who were in the eligible categories. What has the government done? It has decided to cut off 19- to 21-year-olds. But, interestingly, when asked how much money is going to be saved by cutting out all of Australia's 19- to 21-year-olds, would you think millions of dollars or tens of millions of dollars would be saved? No; half a million dollars is going to be saved by this measure&mdash;a paltry sum to take away this right of deaf people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I was parliamentary secretary we had requests from people over 21 who wanted this service. I was actually looking at ways in which we could extend the service to people over 21 in need. What is the government doing now? It is going backwards. It is saying, `If you're over 18, you're not going to get the service.' If it was a budget measure of a huge saving, that would have been something; but half a million dollars is a paltry sum. If you tighten up a couple of malpractices in medicine you save that sum within a week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the next issue, Commonwealth senior health card holders, is even more disgraceful. People who have the senior health card are no longer going to have access to the services of AHS or to the other services of private providers on that basis&mdash;talk about attacking a vulnerable sector of the community. Senior health card holders are people who have retired, who have made a contribution to this country and who may be having problems with their hearing. And the government is saying, `Bad luck. From now on you're going to have to pay full rates. You're not going to get any subsidised hearing aids. You're not going to get any free hearing aids. You're not going to get any free support from Australian Hearing Services or from this government.' What an appalling situation and what a mingy
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> policy. It is a policy that is contrary to all principles of social justice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The health minister, Michael Wooldridge, and the former parliamentary secretary ought to be ashamed of themselves for having agreed to this proposal. We are not talking about a group of people who are not in need; we are talking about a group of people who are suffering from deafness. In relation to understanding what it is like to give deaf people the capacity to hear, I have seen children suddenly awake to the world when they have been provided with hearing aids. I have seen older people suddenly gain a new burst of life when they have been given the ability to hear. Instead, as I said, we have this mingy proposal which is going to save a little bit of money but be at the cost of people in genuine need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, as you have a hearing service in your electorate, you would know what I am talking about. This corporatisation is going to require a budget contribution from the AHS. This means that costs will go up because they will not have the capacity to provide the services at the lowest rates. Instead of the government making it harder for people to access hearing services by bringing in these half&hyphen;baked proposals with respect to the AHS, they should have been focusing on the real issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One issue that I raised when I was parliamentary secretary, about which the government has done nothing in 12 months, was the critical problem of the need to provide hearing aids for Aboriginal children. We discovered in one area that over 80 per cent of Aboriginal children were suffering from hearing problems. The AHS was building a program to deal with this issue. What has happened to that program? The government, in its obsession to dismantle the AHS, has forgotten about those real issues. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak briefly to one aspect of the Hearing Services Administration Bill 1997, the bill having generally been covered on this side of the House by contributions yesterday from the members for Dobell (Mr Lee) and Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) and this
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1538"> morning from the members for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson) and Calwell (Dr Theophanous).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to restrict myself to that part of the bill which reduces the eligibility of hearing services for young Australians from 21 to 18. The member for Dobell, the opposition spokesman on health matters, has indicated to the House that the opposition will move an amendment to oppose that part of the bill and to restore eligibility for young deaf Australians aged 19 to 21. I strongly support that amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do so because I have an electorate interest in this matter. The Maylands Institute for the Blind is situated in my electorate. The Institute has housed with it an office to assist people who are both deaf and blind. The bill will have an adverse impact on some of those people. Secondly, Australian Hearing Services in the CBD of Perth is within my electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, while it is not specific to my electorate, I have been approached by an organisation in Western Australia known as PUSH, Parents United to Support Hearing Impaired Children, which is chaired by a former member of the state parliament in Western Australia, the Hon. Barry MacKinnon. I will detail those representations to the House shortly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill was introduced and given its second reading in the House by the member for Pearce and Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan). In the course of her second reading speech, she stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 1 of schedule 2 of the bill gives effect to 1996-97 budget measures involving changes to program entitlements for hearing concessions. As a result of these measures, people who hold a Commonwealth `seniors health care card' will no longer be eligible for the full range of free hearing services. Similarly, people over the age of 18 who are not pensioners or eligible for some other reason will no longer receive the full range of hearing services. People who become ineligible following these changes will still be able to obtain free maintenance services for their hearing aids for a further five years. The government regards both of these changes as fair, given the limited resources that it has available to it.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The government regards as fair the removal of the entitlement to hearing services for
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> people between the age of 18 to 21, given the limited resources available to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The best one can ascertain from the budget papers and responses to questions by ministers opposite is that the cost of removing the eligibility for hearing services from young Australians aged 21 down to 18 is an annual cost of $500,000 and, as best as I can ascertain, over four years, $1.5 million. So to take away these hearing services from young deaf Australians aged 19 to 21 on a yearly basis is the cost of a Speaker's chair&mdash;the cost of a Speaker's chair to take away these services from young Australians aged 21, 20 and 19.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What sort of civilised society is that supposed to reflect? What sort of pernicious attitude is that supposed to reflect? What sort of message does that give to Australians? The government, on the basis of a decision which it articulates as being fair because of limited resources available to it, will take away services to young deaf Australians because they cost the equivalent of a Speaker's chair in one financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given that the Commonwealth budget goes to billions of dollars, and given that one of the classic philosophical threads of thought of the Liberal Party is said to be to seek to assist those less disadvantaged than the general community, one might have thought that in the hearts of the Minister for Family Services and the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) they could find $500,000 from the billions of dollars of Commonwealth revenue available to the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would not have thought that the Minister for Family Services could have been so pernicious. It is not enough to force elderly Australians to sell their homes to enter nursing homes; it is doubly pernicious to say to young deaf Australians, `For the cost of a Speaker's chair, we remove your eligibility for hearing services.'</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">That sentiment is echoed by ACROD, the National Industry Association for Disability Services, in ACROD's newsletter in September/October of last year. Under the heading `Services for children are of particular concern', ACROD says, in respect of the government's decision to reduce eligibility to 18 years:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ACROD does not agree with the decision to reduce the eligibility for AHS services from 21 to 18 years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was pointed out that many young deaf people are still at school beyond the age of 18 due to their learning needs and they will be significantly disadvantaged. There are also concerns that a reduction in availability of services could lead to increasing numbers of young people choosing not to use their hearing aids.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is likely that a further unintended consequence could be an increase in the number of young people and their families choosing to apply for pensions once Child Disability Allowance ceases at age 16, thereby increasing the overall budget costs for the Government.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">ACROD says that, to knock young Australians off hearing services eligibility on the basis of a pernicious decision to save the cost of a Speaker's chair, the net effect may well be an additional burden on the government and the taxpayer. What sort of civilised society does that reflect? I urge members opposite to support the amendment to restore eligibility to young deaf Australians to the age of 21.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It seems to me that this government just continues time and time again, bill after bill, to demonstrate its absolute obsession with
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> divesting itself of the provision of services to our community and of being responsible to our community for that community's wellbeing. The changes that are planned and reflected in the Hearing Services Administration Bill 1997 and cognate legislation are important changes to an area of service for particular people. I would just say at the outset of my speech that the amount of notice given to this parliament by the government in relation to these changes is just not acceptable&mdash;hence, this side's call for the bills to be referred to a Senate committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amongst other things, what these bills will do&mdash;as the previous speaker, the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith), has just highlighted very well&mdash;is, first of all, cut off the young age group of 18&hyphen; to 21&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds from access to Australian Hearing Services. I find it quite amusing, and quite pathetic at the same time, to think that it really depends on what we are considering when deciding when a young person is to be responsible for themselves. Under Austudy I think you now have to be 25, under something else you have to be another age, and under this you have to be 18. It seems to me that there is a very dollar driven philosophy behind deciding who is going to qualify for what and at what age.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other aspect is the cut-off from access to AHS of Commonwealth seniors card holders. That was a not that far back initiative that was very welcomed by those people. It is retrograde, in my mind, to now attempt to remove from those people access to these hearing services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The changes will also introduce a voucher system, which I have very serious concerns about. In other words, the cut-off of certain clients from access to AHS, Australian Hearing Services, is very definite in this bill and has set us down a road which I believe will lead to the ultimate privatisation of the complete service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australian Hearing Services is a model public service provider. I have to declare a personal interest in this to the degree that my elderly mother, who is now 79, very reluctantly a few short years ago admitted that she did need assistance from some hearing service providers and is a qualified client of Austral
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1540"> ian Hearing Services. My observation of the levels of service, care and concern delivered to her in the dispensing of what I believe, on behalf of the taxpayers, is a very cost efficient service has been one of nothing but admiration for the way the service currently works. When the coalition went to the electorate a year ago, its promise&mdash;obviously, now we can say that it was apparently a non-core promise&mdash;to preserve all pension benefits has proven yet again to be a broken promise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Previous speakers have outlined and explained the work of Australian Hearing Services, and I will not go back over that ground. But we do need to look at some of the disadvantages that these bills, in changing this particular area of administration, will create. Currently, the average price to clients through the AHS is something like $400 lower than equivalent private sector providers. I am absolutely bamboozled to understand why it can be economically viable to change a system which is so efficient.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The review by the Centre for International Economics has had something to say about this. I know that previous speakers probably have alluded to these comments, but I would like to go over them again. As I have said, the AHS's cost per new adult client is lower than the fee paid in the private sector. The prices are kept well down and, in fact, I understand, below the OECD average.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report went on to explain the ability that the Australian Hearing Services have to be very efficient in an economic way due to the economies of scale. There is absolutely no doubt that the economies of scale proffered by the AHS are something that must be factored into the equation when we decide to consider such enormous changes. I find the economics of this whole thing very puzzling. I think we really need to consider these things very carefully.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand at the moment that, rather than importing hearing aids, we have very highly skilled job and industry areas. I understand also that there is something like $200 million in foreign investment in sales and exports of high quality hearing aids and devices as well as the continuing growth and health of this particular industry. Why on earth are we
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> going to put that at risk? If this legislation in any way undermines the ability that AHS has had to date to nurture that sort of industry, then I really query the government's judgment in deciding to go down this particular path.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Through AHS we have a bulk buying facility. They can purchase batteries for hearing aids on a bulk purchase arrangement, therefore automatically creating savings in costs. There are costs efficiencies right through the system. I just do not understand why the government seems to think it is a good idea to throw all of that away. Why on earth are we risking this whole economic balance?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We already have, in certain areas of public service providing services to the community, some successful systems in place in this country. Those systems are in most cases, and particularly the ones I am going to cite, the subject of admiration through the world. Australian Hearing Services is one, and a previous speaker this morning has already highlighted the fact that many people who do not qualify for AHS want to get into it because it works so well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The pharmaceutical benefits scheme, PBS, is another one. We know that not so many months ago the government were considering huge changes to the PBS. Thank heavens it seems that we have won on that one. But why on earth does this government continue to wish to change, to challenge, to decimate in some cases, these economically viable and economically successful schemes? I am a little bit puzzled as to why, other than because of a philosophical bent, it just seem to think that if it sell its off, if it gives the responsibility for the delivery of services to someone else, it is a whole lot easier. There is a lot more to be considered than that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We must bring to the attention of everyone in the community as much as we can this particular attack on a very proficient and efficient community service, Australian Hearing Services. There is no doubt that this attack has serious consequences for younger people and, as has been said, this is all for just half a million dollars a year. It seems to me to be absolutely ridiculous. I just do not understand why we are doing it.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1541">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to repeat that the short time given for the parliament to consider this bill and therefore for the community to consider the bill is not acceptable; it is disgraceful. We need to think about whether or not the government decided to say, `If we get this through, if we let it slip through quickly, maybe people will not notice what we are actually doing.' They noticed with the PBS, which has a lot more people dependent on it. Maybe with the smaller numbers of people using the AHS they are hoping it will get through uncontended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I want to finish off with a couple of almost  philosophical statements, if I may. I take this opportunity, given that we are talking about a community service here, to remind this government that there is nothing to be gained by blindly going down a road of obsessive privatisation, of obsessive sell&hyphen;off. You have really got to look very carefully at who the recipients are of the service we are talking about, why they need it, how successful it has been in the past and what justification there is for attacking it. I say to the government here in the parliament that at the end of the day you are here to govern for people; you are not here to do much else than that. If you do not have people as your concern, you should not be in the job. You are forgetting at the moment in the sorts of decisions we are seeing, particularly in relation to things like Australian Hearing Services, that very aspect of the job of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I implore members opposite to think very seriously about what you are actually doing to a very successful community service that is highly admired around the world, a service to people who really do need that support. As I said a moment ago, I know from my own personal experience that it is not an easy thing, particularly for older people, to admit that they have to seek the services of something like a hearing service, and when they do come to that decision we have got to make sure as a community that we offer a very efficient, very professional and very caring service to them. Where taxpayers' money is concerned it must, of course, be economical and it must be rationalised so that we can justify what we are doing.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not believe that the changes that are outlined in this bill in any way consider those points. All we are seeing is yet another attempt by the government to divest itself of its responsibility, and in doing so it is putting at risk an extremely efficient, highly admired service to our community.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition does not consider half a million dollars important&mdash;and I listened with interest as the shadow minister for health, the member for Dobell (Mr Lee), spoke on this yesterday when he just swept away a saving of half a million dollars as though it was nothing. And it is no wonder that these people lost government because they are clearly not out there listening to the concerns of the Australian people about budget accountability and about proper management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I listened with interest to my colleague across the chamber, the member for Namadgi (Ms Ellis), when she said just now that we are accountable in this bill. We are accountable; we are accountable not only to those who require hearing services but we are also accountable to the whole Australian population. What we have tried to do here is to produce good policy, sound policy, in relation to hearing services, but at the same time be accountable in government to the whole Australian community. Half a million dollars saving is significant, and it is no wonder that this country was going broke when former ministers just shrug their shoulders about half a million dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Several of the opposition speakers appear not to have read the government's issues
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1542"> paper produced last September which spelt out quite clearly the government's intended direction. They do not seem to know that consumer groups were consulted and that they welcomed the introduction of a voucher system. They appear not to have read the government's position paper, released two weeks ago to industry and to the consumer groups, which clearly outlined the further detail of the system. And they have ignored very important benefits that these changes will bring to people with a hearing impairment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many claims have been made in this debate but few hard facts have been laid on the table, except from this government. First, the Centre for International Economics did a very careful review of the hearing services industry, considered all views and recommended a voucher system much along the lines of the one being introduced. This fact has not been mentioned. The opposition have selectively quoted from this report and have quoted only those pieces that they think support their argument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The centre's report does say that Australian Hearing Services is doing a good job and that consumers are generally happy with what they are getting. But good government requires more than simply doing okay and more than managing to avoid complaints; it involves asking the hard questions such as, `Is there a better way?' Consumers have said that there is a better way. That is really the bottom line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Hearing service professionals say that there is a better way. So we have got not only the recipients of the services and providers of the services saying to government, `What we are doing is okay, but there is a better way to do this,' but the Centre for International Economics report said that there is a better way. So we have not only got the consumers and providers of the product saying that there is a better way but that report in its conclusion said that there is a better way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Second, opposition speakers claim that the voucher system spells the end of Australian Hearing Services, of its joint research venture into hearing aids, of Australian manufacture of hearing aids and of jobs in Queensland. The facts are as follows. Australian Hearing

Australian Hearing Services will continue its joint venture arguments, its research into hearing aid development and other important audiological research responsibilities. Australian Hearing Services will continue to provide its excellent work with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have made this clear in our budget acknowledgment, in our discussions with consumer groups and in our position paper on hearing service program reform. I made it clear in my second reading speech that Australian Hearing Services specialist assistance will continue for people in rural and remote areas, including the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. I cannot understand why the member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) does not know that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has made it very clear that it expects the current contract between Australian Hearing Services and the internationally owned hearing aid manufacturer and assembler Bernafon to be honoured. Every pensioner will continue to receive free hearing services. Very few hearing aids are fully made in Australia; most are assembled from a mix of imported and local parts with limited local manufacture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australian Hearing Services will compete with the private sector hearing service providers for adult customers under the voucher system. Its efficiency and customer satisfaction will be a clear advantage in the competition. I have no doubt that it will strive to lift its game even further, as will the private sector providers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bernafon will have the opportunity to compete for contracts to supply hearing aids under the voucher system, in addition to its present arrangements with Australian Hearing Services. I expect it will put in a very competitive bid, as will all other manufacturers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Third, the opposition has not correctly described the current hearing services system or the voucher system that is being put into place. As I have said, they have failed to read
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1543"> the information that has been made available to them for some time. If they have read it, they clearly have not understood it because they failed to stop and think about the fact that the high private sector prices being paid under the current system, which high prices opposition speakers criticise, were agreed and put into place while they were in government. This would imply that the then responsible minister allowed a contract rate to be set that is apparently so far above the internal cost to Australian Hearing Services. Not only that, but the opposition allowed private sector arrangements to be struck that required no competition and no tender process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the opposition was in government, it made the major expansions in eligibility which have led to the government provider dominating the hearing services market. Private sector businesses rely on referrals from Australian Hearing Services for a significant part of their livelihood. Under the current system, people are told where they can go to for hearing services and whom they can see. The present system gives people a choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that the Australian Hearing Services is an effective and efficient organisation. It does not want the opposition's model of protectionism. It does not need it. It wants to compete. It wants to be in the marketplace and it wants to be freed of the contradictory responsibilities of managing contracts with private sector providers and at the same time competing with them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fourth, the opposition does not appear to understand the basic principles of competitive neutrality. Opposition speakers suggest that Australian Hearing Services should retain its competitive advantages as a government statutory authority&mdash;staffed by public servants and exempt from the cost of taxes and charges&mdash;and then somehow compete with the private sector businesses. Many private businesses during the time I have been in this place have complained of just that point&mdash;that there was one rule for government and another rule for the private sector&mdash;in an era when the opposition in government were proclaiming the virtues of a level playing field. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fifth, the opposition members are mistaken in the number of people that might be affected. One opposition speaker claimed that 30,000 older people will be drastically affected by the eligibility changes. I think the member for Jagajaga, if I am not mistaken, did mention the number.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As at November 1996, 33,037 people had a Commonwealth seniors health care card, but not every older person has a hearing impairment. So far, only about 4,000 people who hold a Commonwealth seniors health care card have sought hearing services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Around 2,000 people in 1994-95, 1,100 in 1995-96 and 800 in 1996-97&mdash;these 4,000 people&mdash;have already had their needs met. They now need access to affordable maintenance and minor repairs of their hearing aid and access to replacement batteries. Even though they will no longer be eligible for other hearing services, the government has already promised that they will continue to be able to obtain these maintenance services for the next five years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have made no secret of the fact that the savings produced from this particular change in eligibility are small. It is not zero, as claimed, but there was no effect on the appropriation level. The savings that were made were left in the program to benefit those most in need.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A similar confusion over numbers may exist over the changes in eligibility for children and young people, where the age cut-off for full service will change from age 21 to age 18. It is unlikely that a young person with hearing loss will not have already had this hearing loss detected well before the age of 18. It is unlikely that such a person will turn 18 without having had their hearing needs rechecked and adjustments made to their hearing or other device. We can be certain that young people aged 18 to 21 who have been
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1544"> receiving government funded hearing services for some years will need access to affordable maintenance and minor repairs of their hearing services and access to replacement batteries. Again, the government has already said that it will ensure access to these services for a period of five years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition has claimed that the new system will not assist wage earning adults&mdash;people who are not part or full pensioners. This is true. What has not been said is that the current system does not assist this group anyway. The opposition is just not telling the full story. The government has to target its effort to take into account people in the community who have the greatest need and ensure that there is adequate protection in place for them. It was fine for the opposition when it was in government to simply expand eligibility, but even the opposition did not assist this group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the statement by the member for Calwell, who proudly stated that when he was responsible for hearing services he wanted to extend free services to people over 21, even the opposition did not attempt to do this. Perhaps it realised that it would lead to absolute government monopoly and drive private sector providers out of business altogether.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is serious about the reduction of the deficit. The government has a responsibility to all Australians and it considered its budget outlays very carefully. Several opposition speakers described the estimated half a million dollar saving from the change in eligibility as small and not worth while. That is why they got the accounts of this country into such a very sad and sorry state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the opposition appears not to have done its basic research or to have read the available information on the new hearing services system, the opposition claims that the government is giving away the buying power that comes with having a monopoly government service provider. This is simply incorrect. The opposition seems to imply that the new scheme will result in paying the highest market rate for single hearing aids bought individually rather than the benefits of bulk
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> purchase. It implied that there will be no centralised purchase and that every purchase of a hearing aid will be a single purchase. This picture better describes the current system of subcontracting by Australian Hearing Services to private providers, which was introduced by the opposition in government when Australian Hearing Services could not meet demand arising from changes in eligibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current system also pays private sector hearing service providers a fixed price for each hearing aid fitted, regardless of the actual price paid. The hearing aids that are being fitted often cost less than the price that the government is paying. We presently have a system where large numbers of hearing aids are purchased individually, but the taxpayer is paying more than the hearing aid cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new hearing aid service arrangements will put an end to this. The government has already issued an invitation to register interest for tenders for the supply of hearing aids to people in the voucher system, using the independent assistance of Purchasing Australia. It is taking every opportunity of the buying power that it has to ensure that the best and fairest price is paid for hearing aids. The initial invitation process will ensure that any necessary finetuning is done and creative options explored before it moves to a formal tender process. We expect that the final steps will involve the letting of common use contracts, which will allow every participating hearing service provider to purchase approved hearing aids at the most competitive price.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Opposition speakers have spoken about disadvantage and hidden agendas and claimed that the new system is somehow going to cause great hardship amongst people who are hearing impaired. Under the current system you can go to only an Australian Hearing Services office. Australian Hearing Services might send you off to a private sector hearing service provider of its choice&mdash;not one of your choice, but one of its choice. You have no choice in the matter under the current system&mdash;the current system that was put in place by the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the current system, you can go to only an Australian Hearing Services office.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1545"> Either you go there or you go to a provider of their choice. Under the current system you will receive good quality service, including professional assessment of your hearing needs, an appropriate hearing aid and other assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a customer, if you are not satisfied with the service you are getting, you cannot go anywhere else. There is no choice about that. I cannot see that there is any equity in that. You can complain. You may not be satisfied that your complaint is considered independently, but where do you take it? You cannot add on to the service you get in any way, even if you want to pay for extras. If you want something a little different to the standard&mdash;and there may be very good reasons why you would want that&mdash;you do not have that choice. You are not allowed to do that under the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the new system you will have the ability to get the hearing services voucher which clearly spells out your entitlements, the ability to take this voucher to the hearing service provider in your nearest shopping centre or professional offices or to any other hearing services provider. You have the ability to have your hearing needs professionally assessed, where necessary, to have a quality hearing aid supplied and fitted, to have the services that are needed to help you get the best use from your hearing aid, and to have the access to affordable maintenance of your hearing aid and replacement batteries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new system also gives you the ability to change hearing service providers if you are not satisfied with the service you are getting, the ability to complain about the decisions that are made in relation to you and your needs or the way in which you are professionally treated, and the ability to obtain other hearing services you may want from the same provider at marginal extra cost. Several opposition speakers have claimed that the new system is the introduction of copayment by stealth. It needs to be remembered that this was the opposition that introduced the only hearing services charge, a $25 annual charge for hearing aid maintenance and replacement batteries. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of other items that I could go on about, but I can see that we are running out of time. Aside from those issues, the opposition implied that the eligibility changes are new and are being rushed through the parliament. These changes were announced publicly last August in the government's 1996&hyphen;97 budget. It said that these changes would be made from March 1997, just as it said that the new voucher system would be in place by 1 July 1997. It was always clear that these changes would mean that legislation would be amended and added to some time between August and March.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The changes that are being made will separate the AGHS from the department and place it on its own as a fully government owned company. It will compete with other private sector health service providers and will have to win its business on the basis of price and, more particularly, on the basis of its capacity and ability to give service or, in other words, perform for the benefit of those who use the services.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to add to the questions. I gather from the comments of the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) that she does acknowledge the answer that was given in the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee portfolio budget estimates where it was stated quite clearly that there will be no savings from Commonwealth seniors health card holders losing their eligibility as a result of this bill. Obviously, it has a relationship to the previous question asked by the member for Dobell (Mr Lee).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is clear from the answer given to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee that the savings in relation to the age cut&hyphen;off will be $1&half; million over four years. What I would like explained a little more than we have been able to understand from the information made available to us is that I understand the predominant savings are coming from the voucher system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not at all clear to me where those savings will actually arise. Is it not the case, as I suggested in my remarks yesterday, that it is going to come from people who need hearing aids actually having to pay more? The department's portfolio statement released at the time of the budget makes it clear that there will be $12&half; million in savings as a result of the government's changes. The vast majority of those arise from what is described as increased competition. Increased competition to me generally means that the consumer is going to pay more and the government is going to pay less. What we need to know is
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1547"> actually how these savings have been arrived at and what they amount to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point is in relation to the reduction in the age cut-off for those aged 18 to 21. It needs to be pointed out that there is still a large number of young deaf people&mdash;I am now looking at an ACROD newsletter, which I am sure the minister is familiar with&mdash;still at school beyond the age of 18 due to their learning needs. From the point of view of ACROD, these people are going to be significantly disadvantaged as a result of these changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We certainly do need to protect not just those who are in the current age group 18 to 21&mdash;the minister has indicated they will be protected&mdash;but also those in the future who may, as the minister said, have had their hearing problems identified. But there will be circumstances where people have not had their hearing problems identified, whether as a result of accident or other misfortune, and we really do need to make sure that these people, who in the main will be remaining dependent on their families, do get access to the services they have had to date from Australian Hearing Services.</PARA></SPEECH>

At the moment, if any of them are found to have a hearing disability, any one of those 33,000 people can use the government Australian Hearing Services to get a state&hyphen;of&hyphen;the&hyphen;art hearing aid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In her answers earlier today, the minister said that the opposition is wrong in saying that 33,000 Australians are going to be affected by this measure because only 4,000 currently use hearing aids and it only really affects 4,000 people. Minister, you ignore the clear fact that 29,000 Australians with seniors health care cards might go to have their hearing assessed tomorrow and then find out that they have a need for a state&hyphen;of&hyphen;the&hyphen;art hearing aid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those 29,000 Australians who currently do not have a hearing aid are those that are about to lose their right to help from AHS as a result of your bill. Surely you will admit that 29,000 are going to be affected by your measure. Will you now at least concede that that is what you are doing? You are taking away from those 29,000 Australians with seniors health care cards their right to use Australian Hearing Services. Even though you get no savings at all from it, you are determined to take away this eligibility from 29,000 Australians. Is that correct?</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My colleague the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) has made a very important point. Of course, the process of growing old and, unfortunately, having hearing loss is not a static thing, as the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) tried to describe it in her previous remarks. She suggested that everything would be all right for the Commonwealth health care card holders because those 4,000 who currently need help from Australian Hearing Services would be okay. But, as my colleague just pointed out, we have more and people getting older and getting eligibility for the Commonwealth health card. Some of those who currently hold the Commonwealth health card are also, unfortunately, likely to lose some or all of their hearing in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1549">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the idea that it is going to affect only 4,000 people is, as far as I can understand the process of ageing, just not correct. The idea that, therefore, the Commonwealth cannot measure what it expects to save from this change also seems to me to be incorrect. If, as my colleague said, you have 29,000 people who in the future could claim support from Australian Hearing Services but now no longer will be able to, that is a prospective saving for the government. At least protect the 33,000 card holders who currently have eligibility. I, and I am sure my colleague, would like to see these card holders protected in the future. If it is the case that there are no savings, as the answers to the Senate questions show, we would expect that to mean that all 33,000 are protected, not just the 4,000 who currently get services.</PARA></SPEECH>

Basically, this is a debating chamber. This is the House of Representatives that debates changes to the law of Australia and, in consideration in detail, we have the right to put questions to you. We have the right to ask what are the consequences of this clause being passed by the parliament of Australia. If you either choose not to or are unable to answer our questions, what does it say about the quality of the legislation that this government is putting before the Australian parliament that you are not prepared to stand up and defend it in the House of Representatives?

The Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) is saying that we have great difficulty understanding; that is why we are asking the question. Is it the case that 29,000 people are going to lose their eligibility? Is that the case? I take it by her silence that it is the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also noticed that when the Minister for Health and Family Services ((Dr Wooldridge) put out a press release about this issue at the beginning of February this was one of the facts that he failed to mention in his press release. He did not mention the fact that these seniors were going to lose access to Australian Hearing Services. We now have the minister refusing to answer questions about the eligibility of 29,000 older Australians. I think we will just have to take it that it is the case that 29,000 people are going to lose their eligibility, unless the minister is able to tell us otherwise.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MG4">Mr LEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;She has perhaps taken the Fifth Amendment. We have put a number of questions to the minister. She has refused to answer them. We do not know how much money the government will be saving through these measures. We have a contradiction between the information given at the time of the budget and in Senate estimates and what the minister has said today. The minister will not clarify how much this government is actually saving by introducing the voucher system and by changing the conditions for eligibility.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The budget papers said that you would be saving $4 million a year, Minister. This bill and your statements this morning say that the introduction of the voucher system is budget neutral. Which is true: what you have said this morning and what is in this document or what you put out last August at the time of the budget and in the Senate estimates? They cannot both be correct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This particular clause takes away from young Australians aged between 19 and 21 who are deaf or have hearing disabilities the right to use AHS services. It saves a measly half a million dollars a year&mdash;one Speaker's chair a year, as we call it. On the very day that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> exposes another $5 billion mistake in the forward estimates&mdash;a $5 billion mistake in the government's accounts&mdash;this minister says that it is worth cutting off access to hearing services for deaf young Australian kids so that they can save half a million dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We strongly oppose this change. We think that it is unfair and that it is totally at odds with all of the commitments given by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) before the last election and totally at odds with the commitments given by the Liberal and National parties that people's entitlements and eligibility would be maintained. Minister, how can you justify cutting off the right of deaf young Australian kids to access hearing services to save this measly half a million dollars? Minister, don't you think it is a contradiction to expect young kids under the age of 21 who have hearing disabilities to rely on their parents to pay for these services when the government, in every other change it is
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> making to social security and Austudy, is seeking to raise the age of independence?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unemployed people and university students up to the age 25 are expected to be looked after by their parents, and yet here is an example of where the government is seeking to lower the age. The only thing these changes&mdash;one age going up and this age going down&mdash;have in common is that both changes allow the government to save money. This paltry half million dollar saving will leave a lot of young Australian kids between the ages 19 and 21 with hearing disabilities unable to access AHS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has refused to answer our questions. She has spoken to the officials in the advisers box dozens of times, but she is afraid to come to the dispatch box and answer our questions. Minister, you have a responsibility to this House to answer the questions that are put to you by members of the House of Representatives. You have demonstrated today that you are simply not up to the job.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a further question, which hopefully the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) can answer: how many young people in the age group concerned does the minister expect will be affected by this change? I see from the information made available to us that the government does expect half a million dollars per year to be saved, but it is important for to us know how many people the minister expects will be affected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister said in her remarks earlier that she did not think very many people would be affected because by the age of 18 most young people will have had their hearing problems identified. That is an important point and one that we acknowledge. But, obviously, if the government does expect to save half a million dollars, it does expect that a number of young people&mdash;we would like to know how many the government estimates will be affected&mdash;will have to pay for their hearing services even though the vast majority of them, as my colleague the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) said, will remain dependent on their parents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is now the case that this government assumes that the majority of these people will
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1552"> not be independent young adults earning an income but still dependent on their parents up to the age of 25. It is very important to know how many young people with hearing difficulties the government thinks will be paying out quite large sums&mdash;large sums particularly for young people who have no other means of support.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition will not be opposing the Retirement Savings Accounts Bill 1996 and cognate bills in the House of Representatives. However, as I will spell out, we do have quite a number of concerns with them as they are currently drafted. The Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, moreover, has been examining the bills closely, and the opposition may well have specific amendments arising out of that scrutiny process when we get to the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor, when in government, examined the issue of retirement savings accounts. At this stage we did not think any attractions they might have outweighed the concerns we had about them, and we did not accordingly go down that path. That said, that is not to say that we did not allow banks to enter the superannuation market. On the contrary, banks such as the Commonwealth Bank and
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the ANZ, through their life insurance subsidiaries, have become quite established in the superannuation sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition parties announced that they would, if elected, allow the establishment by financial institutions of these retirement savings accounts to compete against the traditional superannuation funds. This has been a longstanding policy of theirs which predates the 1993 election. It was promised that RSAs would be designed to provide a simple, portable and flexible deposit style superannuation policy. The public rationale for it was to provide a super product to benefit those sectors of the superannuation market such as low income earners who have transient work patterns and who are not necessarily treated optimally by some of the more traditional superannuation products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But that public rationale is not the whole story. We all know&mdash;and the coalition knows better than we do&mdash;that the private rationale for the introduction of these accounts is as a pay&hyphen;off to some very important financial backers of the coalition: namely, a number of the major banks. RSAs are the method of the banks and other related institutions getting a share of the superannuation market. A further attraction of this product is that it gets the funds onto their balance sheets without having to go through the existing avenue of life insurance subsidiaries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number, as I have indicated, of claimed advantages of RSAs. Let us explore them and see just how advantageous they are. In the first place, the argument has been that RSAs could be used by employees to accumulate all super contributions. For example, in the situation where they might have two or more employers, RSAs would provide a level of simplicity, continuity and control, in effect, in regard to superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was a problem in that aspect of superannuation which involved the existence of multiple small superannuation accounts for the one individual. In government, however, Labor did recognise that problem as a problem, and we amended the law to allow for amalgamation and better tracing of accounts, and also to limit the unfair impact of fees eating into members balances&mdash;an issue I will
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1555"> come back to in a moment. Those reforms have lessened the need, we would argue, for RSAs, according to the criterion I have just mentioned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second claimed advantage of RSAs is that, for older Australians nearing retirement, it is suggested they would act as a safe and secure alternative to traditional super products that are market linked and, therefore, involve a higher level of risk than do RSAs which are a capital guaranteed product&mdash;capital, in other words, cannot be diminished in RSAs by negative investment returns. It is true that capital guaranteed products can and do perform a useful role in the superannuation system. But RSAs are not the only such products. They have, in fact, existed for many years; they are already there as an available alternative. That is another reason why we say that RSAs are not an indispensable new feature of the landscape.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third claim being made for RSAs, as I foreshadowed a moment ago, was that they would offer protection against super funds being eaten away by fees and charges, particularly in those circumstances where perhaps people are or have been caught up in multiple super accounts and in the application generally of the current system to low income earners and part&hyphen;time, casual and intermittent participants in the work force. Predominantly it was these groups for which there was a reasonable concern about superannuation moneys being eaten away by fees and charges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, again, the Labor government in 1994 introduced the protection of small accounts initiative. This prohibited superannuation funds from charging fees and charges on accounts where the balance was under $1,000. That has protected small funds from erosion, and further demonstrates that this particular claimed advantage of RSAs is not really necessary, or not really a big advantage at all or a unique contribution that RSAs and only RSAs can make.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the coalition has been careful to avoid telling members of the public in relation to the returns they will get on RSAs is that these are really, by their nature, low return products. The second reading speech offered by
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the minister on this parent bill continues the practice of not fully coming clean on this basic fact. It states, `RSAs will be a simple, low cost, low risk product.' Why doesn't the phrase `low return' appear added to that particular list: simple, low cost, low risk&mdash;but low return, because they are a low return product. Why isn't the community being told that they will, in fact, lose if they put their savings into these vehicles over the long term by comparison to other available options? I will come back a little later on to spell out just how much of a financial disadvantage is involved in this respect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fourth claimed advantage for RSAs is that they do reflect choice, they do provide choice; they, by their very nature and existence, mean that there will be more choice available to people&mdash;and that is a better thing. The reliance on that degree of rhetoric, the reliance on rhetoric to that effect, about more choice in the superannuation product market has been a real characteristic of the way that the RSA story has been told.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government talks about choice and claims to support choice, but in this case it is offering the choice for people to retire with less superannuation funds than they would otherwise have had&mdash;and, again, I will come back later on to spelling out just how much less is involved here. We in opposition do accept that consumer choice is an extremely important issue. But what is valuable about choice where it is made not by the employee but by the employer? To what extent can people actually benefit from having a choice if they are not given sufficient information to make an informed choice?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously, to make an informed choice, it is absolutely fundamental that individuals be in a position to fully understand, to comprehend, what their choices are and, in particular, what these choices will mean over the longer term. The government has so far completely avoided the responsibility for any kind of education campaign that would ensure that individuals are aware of all the implications of their choices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said that there was a real question here as to whose choice it is in the ordinary industrial situation&mdash;the employer's or the employee's.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1556"> One very strong concern we have with this legislation are provisions which allow an employer to open an account on behalf of an employee, removing the ability for the employee, we say, in practice, to effectively choose between traditional superannuation products and an RSA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The industrial reality is simply this: if an employer approaches a new employee and states that his preferred superannuation option is an RSA, the employee is unlikely in the real world to be in any kind of position to contest that. The power relationships in the workplace just do not work like that. That would be the situation, even where the employee had an existing superannuation fund of his or her own. We see that producing a rather ridiculous situation of the employer effectively being able to force the employee, again, to have multiple superannuation accounts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In an age of so-called relationship banking, it is quite possible that a business could reach some agreement with an RSA provider where, in exchange for, say, half a per cent reduction on their business loans, all employees of that employer take out an RSA from that particular provider. We say that that is an unacceptable possibility that should be rigorously guarded against.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The possibility of third line forcing, as it is called, is particularly of concern to the opposition. While we recognise that the Trade Practices Act does prohibit this, the Australian Consumers Association has raised a number of relevant questions concerning the ability of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the ACCC, to intervene in a third line forcing dispute in the financial services sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is clear from what I have been saying that the only people who really gain an unfettered choice under this legislative package will be the employers. The other aspect of the choice question goes to the issue of disclosure. If you really were concerned about making choice a reality for super consumers, you would be requiring much more than is presently the case in these bills on disclosure. The bills currently require the RSA provider&mdash;the bank, in other words, in the usual
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> case&mdash;to disclose to the employer all information relevant to the performance of an RSA, a retirement savings account. The RSA provider is only required to disclose this information once. So in the event of an employer opening these accounts for, say, 20 employees, it is apparent on the face of the legislation that the provider only has to provide one set, for a start, of disclosure documents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once the disclosure to the employer has taken place, the employer may then open on behalf of an employee an RSA account. Once an account is opened in this way, the employee is given a 14&hyphen;day cooling off period during which time the employee can choose to opt out of the RSA with no penalty fees. But, again, in the real world the question is whether this would be a realistic option, given industrial realities in the usual workplace situation and also given the reality of varying degrees of individuals' capacity to fully understand the complexities of these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have just seen an amendment proposed to be moved in the consideration in detail stage of this debate which further emphasises the unreality of this 14&hyphen;day cooling off period by removing the present requirement in the bill as originally tabled that the funds, during that 14&hyphen;day period, be put in a trust account. That is no longer to be the case&mdash;a frank acknowledgment by the government, it seems, that the 14&hyphen;day period is just a statutory formality and is not intended to offer any real occasion in practice for a reversal of the decision initially made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Going on from there, I make the point that it is extraordinary, in our judgment, that at no point is the RSA provider required to disclose information directly to the employee prior to the account being opened on his or her behalf. Nor is there any obligation even placed upon the employer, as I see the bill at the moment, to ensure that all relevant information is disclosed to the employee. Under any sort of equity and choice, it ought to be the employee's decision to open an RSA, not the employer's. But that is not the way the whole dynamics of this process envisaged in this legislation are going to work. Currently, in traditional superannuation products, employ
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1557"> ees do have to sign an application form before a superannuation account can be opened on their behalf. We say that is normal and sensible and should apply in the case of RSAs as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So in addition to all those claimed advantages of RSAs&mdash;their provision of choice and so on&mdash;which we say are flawed advantages, we have another four or five specific concerns which I will now take this opportunity to spell out. The first of these additional concerns goes to the question of simplicity. An RSA is supposed to be simple. But if it is so simple, why do we have a primary bill of 154 pages, a consequential amendments bill of 83 pages, and a brand new supervisory levy set of provisions as well? There are also estimates, I understand, that there will be between 200 and 300 further regulatory provisions governing the operation of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, this new regime is going to be anything but simple. Of course, the level of complexity proposed will inevitably increase the cost of the provision of RSAs relative to that cost which was talked about before the election, making it very difficult, we think, for providers to really provide a cheap, flexible and portable product.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this is not confusing and complex enough, this legislation is, as I have just indicated, going to be made even more complex by some further amendments to be moved later in the debate. It may well be that there will be further amendments still flowing from the report of the Senate select committee which is due on 6 March. Just by its very nature, I know there is an inherent degree of complexity associated with the creation of these financial instruments by legislation, but it all points to a picture very much at odds with the central claims being made about these new accounts: that they are all very simple, clean new products coming on the market which will be to everyone's unmitigated advantage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second additional concern that I want to spell out goes to the question of prudential regulation. One of the biggest charades with the debate on RSAs has been the assertion that the current system is not a level playing field and that RSAs will make it so. In fact,
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> we argue the contrary is the case. Currently, banks and other institutions are able to provide super products but these have to be delivered, in each case, through a trust structure. The reason that a trust structure is to be preferred is that the trustees have a duty to guard the interests of the fund members. Under the RSA structure, the directors of the RSA institution do not have any duties to the RSA members at all. Their duty continues to be to the shareholders. That is why we have consistently called for any RSA product that was going to be introduced to be prudentially regulated in a similar manner to traditional superannuation products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1993, the then Labor government led the world through the introduction of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision)&mdash;or SIS&mdash;Act. We say that this should be applicable to the kind of circumstances that are in issue here. That act established that a complying superannuation fund had to be governed by trustees. Those trustees have a common law trustee duty as well as a dual obligation under the SIS Act. If a trustee fails to act in the best interests of the beneficiary, that is to say, the member, the trustee is both personally and professionally liable. This test is double the current standard required from corporate directors under the Corporations Law. The general trustee duty impacts on the management of investment portfolio strategies, the administration of moneys and the provision of services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The SIS Act also stipulates that there has to be equal employer and employee representation. That is a further safeguard to the prudent management of the funds by ensuring that members' representatives are, in fact, trustees. Once you move to a non-trust structure of the kind that is involved with these RSAs, you completely lose that kind of safeguard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me come to the actual financial impact on consumers of making the choice to embrace an RSA product&mdash;a point to which I have made reference a couple of times earlier. Let me now come back to it, as I said I would.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Treasurer (Mr Costello), the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp) and the financial services industry have readily admitted that
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1558"> the RSAs will be a low growth and low return product in comparison with those elsewhere on the market. It would have been nice if they had admitted that a little bit more clearly in the legislative introduction of this bill, as I said earlier. Nonetheless, that has been a characteristic of a lot of the statements about these, and necessarily so because the product is, as I said earlier, to be capital guaranteed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, that means that employees really do have to be given sufficient information about the financial implications of their decisions so they can evaluate the long-term consequences of choosing an RSA product over a traditional superannuation product that is by comparison market linked. Certainly, it is absolutely crucial that workers who are considering an RSA&mdash;to the extent that they have any choice about it and that employers are not just doing it for them&mdash;understand the long-term costs of remaining in an RSA relative to having their super in a managed superannuation fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Consumers Association recently prepared a very revealing table comparing three different individuals with different super arrangements. I will just spell out the central themes coming through that. The three individuals are called John, Sally and Tom. They all have the same income and working life. For the first five years of their working lives they all contribute to an RSA, one of these retirement savings accounts that are now going to be established. At the end of those five years, they have all $10,000 in super. The table then takes them down three diverging paths and compares the financial returns to each of them from those three paths.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John stays in an RSA for all his life, earning an average real interest rate of one per cent. That real interest rate takes into account the difference between actual interest rates and inflation, whatever it is at the time. When he retires, his final real benefit is $164,400 on the various assumptions that are spelt out in more detail on this document.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second individual, Sally, takes her super out of an RSA after five years and puts it in a managed super fund. She continues to contribute to that super fund for most of her
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> working life and that earns a real interest rate of four per cent&mdash;a reasonable assumption in the real world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Sally retires, her final real benefit is $225,200, compared with $164,400 for someone who just keeps their super in the RSAs. The only difference between the two of them on these assumptions is that she has had her super in a managed fund earning a higher real interest rate. They both made exactly the same contributions over that period, but Sally is $90,000 better off at retirement than John.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third path that is mapped is that of Tom, who, like Sally, on this assumption after five years takes his super out of the RSA and deposits it in a managed fund earning a real interest rate of 6.5 per cent&mdash;a slightly higher risk, but there are plenty of funds around producing those kinds of returns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Tom retires, his final benefit at that higher interest rate is $390,200. Just by earning that higher interest rate&mdash;even though he made exactly the same contributions, is exactly the same age and has exactly the same life cycle&mdash;he is almost $230,000 better off than John. They both made the same contributions, but John has kept his super in the low return RSA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those very simple straightforward comparisons do indicate the very high cost of remaining in an RSA for any long period of time. It is absolutely vital that consumers fully understand that. There might be some reasons and convenience, particularly for transient people, multiple employers, part-timers, casuals and so on, notwithstanding the consequences I have just spelt out, for an RSA choice to be made, but people should understand the nature of that choice and the potential financial sacrifice that is involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fourth additional concern that we have about all this goes to the question of insurance. One of the big success stories in superannuation has been the provision of death and disability and total and permanent disability insurance protection through the super system. For many low income earners, the introduction of the superannuation guarantee arrangements was the first real opportunity for them to be able to access affordable insurance cover. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1559">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Professionals have been able to buy their own policies for years in this respect&mdash;many people have&mdash;but, by and large, lower income earners have not. The super arrangements that they are now participating in with the industry funds, by and large, now have these additional benefits associated with them. There have been numerous examples of when this cover is absolutely essential for the wellbeing of a fund member or their family in the event of injury or death.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are very concerned that banks, building societies and credit unions which pick up the RSA option do not offer such insurance cover. Even if they do decide to offer such cover, our concern is that the cost of it in this context may be excessive and a real disincentive to it being taken out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The remaining additional concern that we have about all this new legislative scheme is that it does involve a bias against the existing industry superannuation funds. The introduction of RSAs into the super product market has been promoted, as I have already said, as creating a level playing field. Financial institutions have been lobbying for a long time to gain access to super.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a matter of concern that, while banks, building societies and credit unions will be now able to provide RSAs, there is no provision currently for public offer and industry funds to offer an RSA look-alike product. If there is to be a level playing field in the super product market, public offer and industry funds have to be able to offer an RSA product and be able to market it as an RSA. This would mean that there is open competition and it would actively encourage real choice in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why have they been excluded? We can only speculate, I think on very reasonable grounds, that it is because of the links of the industry funds with the award system and trade unions. There is a very clear ideological agenda that has sat behind everything the government has said and done when it comes to super&mdash;and I think we see an example of that here again in this context.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They have also, perhaps it is reasonable to conclude, been excluded for commercial reasons&mdash;knowing that they would be very
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> effective competitors to the banks and other institutions. Therefore, given the nourishment, solace, comfort, aid and assistance that is being given to the banks and other institutions by this legislation, it is a rather unattractive reality to have to confront that they may be subjected to competition in this respect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me finally say in the few minutes available to me that there has been an awful lot of politics at the expense of good policy in every aspect of this government's treatment of superannuation issues. It is evident in the superannuation surcharge issue, now the subject of legislation and so much controversy in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government wanted to be seen to be doing something which would offer a bit of a slap over the wrist of higher income earners to better make its pitch to middle Australia that they were the preferred objects of the government's affection. Maybe there was a case in equity for doing something here. We have not contested that. But there sure as hell was not a case for doing it in this particular muddled, confused, hopelessly complex, administratively cumbrous way, made so by the government's further political insistence that what was involved here was not really a tax increase at all but simply something in the nature of a surcharge that was not really a tax at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the Treasurer finally let the cat out of the bag yesterday on the John Laws program by actually describing this as a tax, very interestingly. But what I am saying is that the politics of the choice to pretend that this was just some kind of surcharge, not a tax increase, and therefore in breach of election promises, led the government down a path of ridiculous administrative complexity which has made it an object of derision in the super industry as a result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The further concern about the policy aspects of this is that the impact of this particular provision on national saving, which is supposed to be the primary rationale of all these budgetary measures, is at best uncertain and more likely to be negative. For every dollar taken by the government from super, through imposts of this kind, the reality is that private saving falls by a dollar. Unless higher income
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1560"> earners increase their saving to compensate for the extra tax, the effect on national saving will be zero. Further administrative costs, which I have just been referring into the equation, and the impact on national saving may in fact be negative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other crucial political issue in all of this has been this government's attitude towards the One Nation superannuation contributions, which we promised and which this government before the election indicated it would honour&mdash;that is, the additional government contribution of three per cent to wage and salary earners to be matched in turn by an employee contribution of three per cent, bringing the total level of required contributions to superannuation funds up from the present target of nine per cent to 15 per cent in a way which would make quite a spectacular difference to our national saving performance, which is the rationale, as we have constantly been told, behind the whole government strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To remove, as seems now to be very actively contemplated by the government, that three per cent contribution in the forthcoming budget, to wave it goodbye&mdash;as it seems will inevitably be the case&mdash;will mean, on the kinds of calculations we had available to us in government before the election, that a 35&hyphen;year&hyphen;old man, for example, earning average weekly ordinary time earnings at the moment, without that extra co-contribution arrangement, without that promise being honoured, on retirement will be $104,000 worse off in terms of the superannuation funds available to be taken up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The general rhetoric has all been about the macro&hyphen;effect of improving the national savings performance and the micro-effect of improving choice for individuals. The government has done neither. These RSAs are not going to help in any respect at all. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find it rather ironic that the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans) would appear, at least in the last five minutes of his address, to be more concerned about an initiative, the superannuation surcharge, which will require high income earners to make a greater contribution
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to the government's fiscal consolidation program dealing with the legacy left to us by the previous government of which he was a part, than he is about the retirement savings account initiative, which will principally be to benefit low income earning Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These three bills&mdash;the Retirement Savings Accounts Bill, the Retirement Savings Accounts (Consequential Amendments) Bill and the Retirement Savings Accounts Supervisory Levy Bill&mdash;are very much an initiative which will add to the choice and the options available for low income and, particularly, itinerant working Australians. In commencing my address, I would particularly like to pay tribute to my predecessor, David Connolly, whose ideas and drive were able to bring this to fruition. I think his efforts in this area should be remembered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation implements the budget decision last year to allow banks, building societies, credit unions and life insurance companies to provide superannuation without a trust structure in the form of RSAs. RSAs will be required to be capital guaranteed. Also, importantly, the accounts into which a member and/or an employer contributes on the member's behalf will be able to make contributions, will be fully portable, will be owned and controlled by the member and be subject to retirement income standards applying to other superannuation products, including preservation and disclosure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Superannuation products are usually issued under a trust structure that requires a trustee to be responsible for the actions of the trust and to comply with prudential and other regulations as are outlined in the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993. The preferential tax rate of 15 per cent, which applies to complying superannuation funds, is generally a fairly powerful inducement for compliance. Non-complying funds are generally liable to the company tax rate as they are effectively company trusts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The trustee structure reflects the fact that superannuation funds hold money on behalf of contributors with net investment earnings being credited to the members' accounts. At the moment, financial institutions can offer superannuation products by establishing
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1561"> subsidiaries that have a trustee structure, thereby complying as a fund and receiving the tax concession. AMP, ANZ, GIO and others, for example, have established such subsidiaries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">RSAs have been identified by us as an alternative to the trustee based superannuation structure. From our perspective, they address three principal problems that exist under the current superannuation arrangements. The first of these is lack of choice. Federal awards which have been allowing for compulsory award superannuation have been paid into industry funds with equal employer-employee, usually union controlled, trustee representation. Workers have found that they simply have little choice on the fund into which an employer will make contributions on their behalf.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Industry funds usually advantage employers&mdash;I think that needs to be recognised&mdash;as they only have to deal with a single fund which reduces their administration costs. Hopefully at some stage in the future superannuation will not be a matter included in industrial awards. If at some stage the government and the Australian Democrats are able to agree on amendments to the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2), then we might be able to achieve that. RSAs, once established, may make future amendments to be considered for that bill in this regard perhaps a little easier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second issue that RSAs address is that of small balances. This is a major problem. I recognise what the member for Holt was saying about the protection of small sums, as commendably introduced and effected by the previous government. One thousand dollars is a lot of money, but if you have $2,000 or $3,000 in a superannuation fund&mdash;I do not know about anybody else&mdash;sometimes I wonder whether you would be better off hiding it under your bed, as a former Prime Minister once said. By the time the charges and various costs are levied on sums of $3,000 or $4,000, you can find over time that it is not growing much at all and, in some cases, depending on the performance of the fund, it can actually be going backwards. I would certainly suggest that having sums at
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> or below $1,000 being exempt from charges is still inadequate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The superannuation guarantee charge has no way of protecting small balances in super funds. The funds are being eroded by fees and charges. You are forced to make a contribution&mdash;at least your employer is&mdash;and then you find there is less in it than you actually put into it. If charges are not enough in years of negative investment return, much of the balance can be wiped out. Although the Small Superannuation Accounts Act, which allowed the ATO to operate small assets with no fees, has helped, Australians still need and deserve the choice that RSAs are going to bring.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third issue that they address is the number of accounts. Given that now some 34 per cent of the work force is working part time and are increasingly mobile, many employees find that they end up with small amounts in multiple superannuation funds, each one eroding the balance with fees and charges, essentially feeding the industry and providing the employee with little if any retirement savings. Whilst RSAs deal with this problem and allow a permanent alternative payment, but portable, savings vehicle, without changing awards to allow the alternative payment into an RSA the problem may well persist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this regard, I am interested to know whether the opposition and unions in particular will encourage changes to awards which recognise RSAs. Given the interest that unions have in award nominated funds, I will not hold my breath. To be fair, though, I think we might anticipate reluctance on the part of some employers to contribute to a range of RSAs rather than a single industry fund due to the associated administrative costs that might be incurred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">RSAs will offer lower returns. I think people need to be honest about that. I do not think the Treasurer (Mr Costello) or anybody else has ever denied this would be the case. But, in making these points, you do not want to downplay unreasonably the importance of RSAs and you do not want to create a market expectation which the banks then find very easy to fulfil. The fact is that they will offer lower returns than conventional superannua
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1562"> tion funds, which reflects the capital guaranteed nature of RSAs where the amount that is invested cannot be reduced due to negative investment returns. However, I think this is going to be more than offset by having multiple accounts containing small sums which are eroded by fees and charges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although some, including the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia&mdash;which is not surprising&mdash;have called for a limit on what can be kept in an RSA, given that the lower rate of return would diminish the amount available for retirement, the government has instead chosen a requirement that RSA providers inform holders of their investment options when the limit is reached. In other words, let the contributor make a choice themselves&mdash;hopefully an informed one. Whilst the member for Holt and the Consumers Association quite rightly have made the point about reduced capital growth in an RSA, I have no doubt that ASFA will be out there vigorously reminding the RSA market and contributors of the greater benefits and returns that they would have in putting their funds into a typical superannuation fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given the nature of my electorate, many of my constituents will find RSAs attractive for another reason. Those are the people nearing retirement age who are understandably anxious to see that their savings are placed in a nice safe place where there is minimal erosion. The low risk capital guaranteed nature of RSAs presents an attractive alternative to the possibility of negative investment returns from a conventional superannuation fund&mdash;another reason for prescribing a limit to the balances on an RSA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, such security should not be confused with a guarantee that the money cannot be lost. If for some reason the financial institution faces difficulties&mdash;as unlikely as that might be&mdash;and is forced into liquidation, the funds in an RSA cannot be guaranteed. One of the things that we will need to do as a government&mdash;and I think vigorously&mdash;is, coming back to the member for Holt's comments, to facilitate education in the community to an understanding of the difference between a capital guarantee and an absolute guarantee. This especially applies to
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> those close to retirement seeking to park their superannuation savings. Capital guarantee means that the balance of the account cannot be reduced through negative interest or negative investment returns or any reduction in the value of assets in which the policy is invested.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of particular interest in the legislation to contributors is clause 15 of the bill, which states that an RSA must provide one or more of the benefits that are listed in the clause. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The benefits . . . are benefits for the holder of the RSA on or after one of, or the earlier of, the following:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) the holder's retirement . . . </PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) the holder's attainment of an age not less than the age specified in the regulations;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The benefits . . . on or after the holder's death, if:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) the death occurred before:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> (i) the holder's retirement . . . or</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> (ii) the holder attained the age prescribed . . . and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) the benefits are provided to the holder's legal personal representative, to any or all of the holder's dependants, or to both.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Where one or more of those benefits is provided, the RSA may also provide one or more of the following: firstly, benefits for the holder on termination of employment where the employer or an associate of the employer contributed to the RSA, which, of course is portability; and, secondly, benefits for the holder where the holder ceases work on account of ill health.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Employees will also be able to transfer the money out of a RSA at any time&mdash;and that is another thing to which people are particularly attracted&mdash;although RSA providers may require notice of not more than 12 months to minimise liquidity risks. RSAs present a particularly attractive option for women who frequently have, for obvious reasons, interrupted working lives and need a flexible, low cost and easily accessible product. They are also attractive to small businesses which can open a RSA on behalf of employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I come back to the comments of the member for Holt when he was talking about employers opening retirement savings ac
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1563"> counts. I do not know how much time he spends talking to people in small business, but this is one of the extra burdens that people have who are in small businesses, employing only a small number of employees and struggling to stay afloat. To increase the ease with which an account may be opened on behalf of an employee into which compulsory superannuation contributions can be made has got to make it just a little bit easier for those people who are creating the wealth&mdash;which is then taxed, and which we then distribute to those in need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Holt referred to RSA regulation. There are going to be two central components to regulation: firstly, prudential supervision for the institutional security of the RSA provider and, secondly, functional supervision for compliance with retirement income and other superannuation standards. Prudential supervision&mdash;you cannot duplicate what already exists&mdash;will naturally remain in the hands of the Reserve Bank; in the case of banks, it will be the Australian Financial Institutions Commission; and, in the case of building societies and credit unions, it will be the state supervisory authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Functional supervision for both RSAs and their providers will be the domain of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission which will regulate compliance and retirement income standards. The standards will ensure that not only are RSAs are maintained for genuine retirement purposes but contributors are well informed. Again, the government clearly has an interest in seeing that people are informed when they make a choice about whether they are going to put into a RSA or whether they are going to take it out. ASFA clearly have a commercial interest in seeing that people are well informed. Also, the ISC, as part of its responsibility, is going to see that the market is informed. I think the criticisms made in that regard by the member for Holt are a bit unrealistic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of those financial institutions wishing to sell RSAs need to be approved by the ISC but the approval process creates presumption in favour of the applicants, and the applicants will be rejected by the ISC only when it can
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> prove that the institution cannot meet retirement income standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It remains to be seen if RSAs are the answer to Australia's bigger picture problem of an appalling savings record. They are not intended to be. Some people who have spoken favourably in the press about RSAs have said that it might contribute to our big savings record, and so on. When you consider the millions of dollars left unclaimed in superannuation funds and the benefits that RSAs will provide in giving people portability when they move from job to job and so on, I do not know whether that is necessarily going to be the case, despite what will be their undoubted popularity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Critics will argue that, if too much is saved in lower earning capital guaranteed accounts, they are missing out on capital growth needed for retirement. Provided contributors are educated of the desirability of transferring out into a superannuation fund once they have accumulated several thousand dollars, I think we should be all right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real issues in national savings, apart from the significant contribution that public savings make, are beyond whatever impact RSAs may have, which, as I say, I do not think is likely to be all that significant. Self&hyphen;evident also is what I expect will be an aggressive marketing campaign from the superannuation industry to encourage&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="KERR" NAMEID="RH4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RH4">Mr Kerr</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What about from the banks?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RW5">Dr NELSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course the banks will be marketing the RSAs&mdash;we hope the banks will be marketing RSAs&mdash;because the people to whom RSAs are going to appeal, as I have said, are going to be low income people, people who are moving from one job to the next and people who have several thousand dollars in superannuation who, frankly, are disillusioned with the performance of many superannuation funds. And then you will have the superannuation industry aggressively marketing itself that, once you get to a certain level in particular, you are certainly better off in a superannuation fund.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To go to the comments made by the member for Denison (Mr Kerr), it could be argued that with RSAs the banks will take on smaller
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1564"> amounts, by definition, of retirement savings, and that will give them entry to a market providing a steady stream of capital that can be on&hyphen;lent, and the cross&hyphen;selling of products. As the market settles, you would expect that most contributors, whether it is at about $10,000 or shortly before that, would transfer out into a superannuation fund. But, if you think about it, the superannuation funds themselves are going to be saved quite a bit in not having to manage small amounts of money. Whilst contributors are understandably aggrieved at the charges and costs that erode small balances, one would think in this new competitive market the funds are not actually going to have the cost of managing multiple small amounts. So let us just see over the next couple of years where the market settles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Holt was referring to the Australian Consumers Association analysis of three workers&mdash;Tom, Sally and John. I agree with his comments, but he also needs to remember&mdash;and this is what this bill is all about&mdash;about Jill or John. Someone might have three part&hyphen;time jobs&mdash;there are many people in Australia who are working this way who are struggling to survive&mdash;which change about eight times over a five&hyphen;year period. At the moment, many of those people under the superannuation guarantee provisions will have multiple small amounts in multiple small funds. We have to listen to these people, and what they want is one place in which those small amounts accumulate and which they can carry from one job to the next. That has to be in the interests of working people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Holt started with a most objectionable comment about the coalition introducing and supporting this initiative because of what he sees as some sort of financial relationship between the Liberal Party and banks. I have to tell the member for Holt and you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that when I attended a meeting with senior executives of a major bank in Melbourne several months ago the opening remarks of a serving member of the opposition Labor Party to the chief executive of a major Australian bank were, `Why didn't you give us more money during the election campaign?' Who, I ask, is pre
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> occupied with the potential donations that may be made by financial institutions?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Holt raised the issue of death and disability cover. How far should governments go to look after people? Do we really have to spoon&hyphen;feed people from the cradle to the grave? Whilst I recognise the benefits of death and life cover associated with superannuation funds, let us give people a choice. He also referred to the solace that this gives to banks. Let's just see what the Wallis inquiry delivers. The Wallis inquiry may not deliver that much solace to banks and we may find in a year or two that the insurance companies will be providing many of the banking services that banks currently provide; and with RSAs, of course, we will see banks providing some superannuation services to especially low income people, who are really going to benefit most from this.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am intrigued that the government has commended itself for bringing forward a measure which, whilst failing to address the deficiencies that it asserts exist within the current superannuation system, proposes a new mechanism of superannuation savings which is a guaranteed lemon. To be proud of putting onto the market something that should be labelled, as cigarettes are, `Warning: this product is likely to be dangerous to your wealth,' and then to say that the product ought to be welcomed by the electorate as providing a greater choice, seems to me to be the greatest mark of self-deception that one can imagine.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us take some of the points that have been raised in this debate. There is the assertion that existing superannuation funds do not provide an adequate basis for small accounts because they get eroded. That might once have been an adequate criticism of the system, but in 1994 the former government brought forward a series of measures which were designed so that small accounts&mdash;that is, accounts under $1,000&mdash;would not be eroded by fees and charges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the current government thinks that was an insufficiently high benchmark, as suggested by the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson), then a more appropriate measure would have been to increase that level&mdash;not to put onto
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1565"> the market a product which will be aggressively marketed by the banks to those in the community who are probably least well versed on how to assess their own financial advantages. It will be aggressively marketed in the retail sector by the banks. They will be offering a product which, on the government's own admission, is substantially defective and which will produce fewer returns than they ought to be able to receive elsewhere in the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at some of the other points that are being advanced in relation to the benefits alleged in this product. It is said that these funds are a useful vehicle for the elderly to park their sums of money in before they retire. The elderly, by nature, are extremely cautious. When people are in their advanced years, they tend to act on a precautionary principle. I think anyone who has dealings with their elderly family knows how extremely frightened they are about volatility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The banks and the other financial institutions that will offer these products will promote their superficial attractions and advertise the availability of a capital guaranteed product. They will trade on what this government has said; that is, this is a simple, low cost, low risk product. The banks will feed off this rhetoric.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The banks will go to those people, who could earn substantially greater rates of return in existing capital guaranteed products within the superannuation industry, and they will attract substantial numbers of accounts. It will not just be the piddling amounts of $1 or $2 that we are talking about from the occasional person in the part-time industries, the banks will be out there ruthlessly marketing this scheme to the elderly, who naturally want a low risk product. They will be saying, `We are part of the big institutional system. The banks that you have always relied on are safe. Put your money into our low risk, low cost product. Save your large nest egg in this manner. We'll look after you.' What they will not disclose is that, as well as being low risk, it is low return&mdash;low and inadequate benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I think we will find is that the same kind of issue will emerge here as emerges in a whole range of areas where we proceed on
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the basis of so-called greater choice. Knowing that the products will be marketed to people who are not in a position to exercise fine judgment about rates of returns and may not read prospectuses closely&mdash;the sorts of people who are going to be making these judgments will be people in and out of the part-time work force or the elderly, who are looking for a simple, safe product before their retirement&mdash;the banks will be out there aggressively selling these products. They will be aggressively selling low return, financially unsound products with this government's imprimatur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">`Yes, it is true,' you will say, `that in so doing they must be provided with information enabling them to exercise certain choice.' If you provide people with a plethora of small print explanation, which will inevitably be the case, you do not necessarily promote wise decision making. The factors that will influence people to make these decisions will be the sorts of factors that will influence people in the marketplace generally. It is the glossy quick advertising: it is a simple, safe, low risk product. Banks provide it. It is something that seems pretty straightforward. It is part of the known universe to most people. They will be attracted to it, notwithstanding that there are existing better products available for them&mdash;products which offer greater rates of return with no greater risk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will pick up on a point that the member for Bradfield made. He said that we have to make a distinction between capital guaranteed products and absolute guaranteed products, but that distinction is not being made by this government. What is actually being put forward as a sotto voce message is that these products are absolutely guaranteed and that they cannot fail. That is not the truth, and the member for Bradfield accurately put his finger on that point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People may well find themselves in a situation where a financial institution makes bad investments and they lose their lifetime savings. There they will be&mdash;having invested in a product which has been marketed with this government's endorsement basically as a risk free investment&mdash;with no recourse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much of this debate reminds me of the famous exchange between a judge and F.E.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1566"> Smith, later Lord Chancellor of England. After a long exchange, the judge said, `Well, I've heard what you have to say, but I am none the wiser.' F.E. Smith said, `None the wiser, Your Honour, but certainly better informed.' Regrettably, providing a lot of information to consumers who are not well positioned to understand that information may leave them better informed but hardly better able to make a good choice, to exercise wisdom.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So here is the failure in this whole system. It is being marketed at a retail level to people lacking sophistication, people who are in the category of society who we know are most likely to plump for the safe decision, even if it involves low rates of return.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What alternatives could have been pursued by this government? They certainly could have allowed for the development of greater portability between existing schemes. That would have been one option. People could then take advantage of placing all of their resources in funds which would actually achieve higher rates of return with the same level of security that they propose now. It would actually give people better life choices and better life chances for their investments. If they felt that the existing $1,000 level for small accounts was inadequate, they could have increased that. If they thought that there needs to be greater competition and choice and yet they still wanted to bring in a RSA product, they could have given existing superannuation funds the opportunity to compete.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, no. What this really represents is an ideological attack on the provision of superannuation through the systems that have been established in the past. It delivers to the banking system&mdash;which was a very financial contributor to the coalition side of politics at the last election&mdash;a product which will, no doubt, increase their bottom line but will not increase the bottom line of those who invest in such a scheme.</PARA>

At the same time, it is acting in a way which is undermining the credibility of the existing superannuation system and driving people out of it. The road to hell is paved with good intentions. Whatever might have been the intentions of the government in proposing a surcharge on higher income earners, what we are seeing now&mdash;as the shadow Treasurer, the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans), so rightly pointed out&mdash;is a system which will carve away at the simplicity of the existing superannuation system, which will make it less attractive. In the view of the Institute of Chartered Accountants, for example, it will lead to 75 per cent of all accountants advising their clients to review&mdash;that is, to move out of&mdash;superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We already have a government that clearly, by the way in which it is dealing with it, seems to be driven not by an appreciation that we need to put in place a simple, effective national system of superannuation&mdash;building on the strengths that the previous government left in place, improving that and maintaining a commitment forward so that there will be increasing contributions, both by employers and by employees, and sustaining it into the future. Instead, what the government is seeking to do is to undermine confidence in that existing system; to attack the legitimacy of the industry funds that exist; to bring a new second-rate player into the system through the banking institutions, which will offer an inferior product; and to erode the commitments they made at the last election for the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1567"> mutual contributions through employers and for the matching funds through government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a recipe leading to disaster. This is a recipe leading to a decline in national savings, to a want of confidence in the superannuation scheme generally. There is a failure to appreciate that what we need more than anything else in this area is a sense of consistency. People will then have confidence that the long-term structural investments they make for their future will not be changed, manipulated or destroyed by successive twists and turns of government policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not the opposition that is speaking alone on these issues. The Institute of Chartered Accountants is making these points, so too is the Association of Superannuation Funds and writer after writer in the quality press. Today in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>, national affairs reporter Mike Taylor said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The problem with the Government's proposed approach to superannuation is that it stands to be highly disruptive to the retirement plans and calculations of individuals . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Of course it is. What could be more calculated to destroy the fundamental confidence that Australians have when they ought to be looking for long-term self&hyphen;interested planning for their retirement? To feel that the government will meddle from time to time in ways which increase complexity, reduce returns, destroy the effectiveness of the superannuation system and put new products onto the market which, under any measure, do not stand up to the test of whether they are adequate and cost effective for those who take them up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we now face will be an extraordinarily complicated system. This bill is supposed to bring a simple product onto the market, but it does it under an act which is made up of many hundreds of provisions and which is complex in its detail. The government is also proposing many amendments, which it certainly has not given the opposition adequate time to evaluate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of those amendments, for example, go to the question of funds that are deposited by employers. Under existing law, if somebody makes a payment for your benefit at common law there is a constructive trust. If
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> I make an investment on your behalf, the law requires that investment to be dealt with as a trust. With these amendments the government is seeking to abridge that legal obligation so that if an employer places money belonging to an employee in an RSA, it is saying, `We'll ignore our trust responsibilities. We'll bring down regulations that will govern the relationship there, not trust relationships.' We haven't any idea what those regulations will be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the regulations are inadequate, then the protections that would normally exist under common law or&mdash;if it was going into a superannuation fund as exists currently&mdash;under the trust deed, would be entirely unavailable. So we are being asked to sign a blank cheque in terms of how people can deal with other people's money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an extraordinary legal proposition. This government is asking us as a parliament to say that one person can deposit money belonging to another person into an account without any trust obligations and without detailing to this House what the alternative financial regulatory scheme will be. There is no doubt that this kind of tinkering is driven by ideology and by a desire to repay those who substantially supported the election of this government through financial donations during the last election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The disclosures under the electoral system make it plain that the coalition benefited substantially from donations from these financial institutions, and to a far greater degree than the current opposition. This is a repayment. The banks will be able to market, to those least well versed to make sound choices, a product which the government will describe as safe and simple, but which offers less adequate rates of return than available products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People will be drawn into these products. If they stay in these products, their lifetime investments will be substantially less valuable than for those who invest in better products which are currently available. The government is not trying to improve the schemes that exist. It is not allowing those who are superannuation trustees presently to offer similar products to compete.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1568">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the government is saying to the banks is, `Go ahead, do what you used to do with the elderly. Offer no rate of return accounts, zero interest rate accounts, bad investment accounts, market them, take advantage of the gullibility of people who do not have the wisdom and the background to make an informed decision and who fear change. Go out and market them, milk them for all you can, but don't let anybody compete with you.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These products should have big health warnings on them, like cigarette packets, which say, `These products are dangerous to your wealth.' For the government to be advancing them is a mark of the contempt in which it holds the Australian taxpayers.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for Denison (Mr Kerr) worked pretty hard on portraying his left&hyphen;wing background when he spent most of his speech telling us that people cannot be trusted with their own money. The reality of his suggestion is that people are so foolish in this day and age, even though newspapers and the media are full of advice on financial management, that they are going to rush off and buy a lemon simply because the bank puts an advertisement in the paper.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have an entirely different view. I welcome the retirement savings legislation, which I have supported since it was first proposed by David Connolly in our party room some years ago. My reasons are simple. Firstly, it opens up further opportunities and greater diversity for people's retirement savings. As has been explained by other speakers, this has proved to be essential.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The parliamentary record will show that, some five or six years ago, I was one of the first members of this House, if not the first, to bring to the attention of the parliament how at that stage the award type superannuation schemes were totally inadequate for people such as shearers and others in itinerant work. I detailed specific examples which were brought to my attention by my constituents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those examples showed the problems that existed with most of those accounts. Because of the itinerant nature of the work and the fact that, during their working year, those people were forced to contribute to different award
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> type superannuation schemes as they transferred from being a shearer to, for instance, a truck driver at certain seasons of the year, most of the net balances of their accounts at that point in time&mdash;years before the SGC became a reality&mdash;were less than the employer contribution and were disappearing before their eyes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On another occasion I had brought to my attention the case of a girl who had regular employment for nine months of the year in three different jobs. She had the same job for three months for each of those three months of the year, and she had three separate superannuation arrangements. The previous government's solution was to say, `You can send the money to the Taxation Office.' I have never been able work out how that worked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People in that sort of environment need a capital guaranteed product. They need to know that the money that is contributed will stay there and will go through the simple process of accumulating, if nothing else, interest. Presumably in the competitive environment the banks will know that if they start applying any management fees to these accounts people will very smartly wake up, because the other fact of life is that they will have daily access to the balance in those accounts simply by making a phone call.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They offer to the consumer a very good further option to the superannuation guarantee products that have been available so far. For people who have regular employment and who are not roped into one of the schemes conducted by various trade unions, we have set about giving them some rights over their money. They have the opportunity to change to another arrangement if they believe their interests would be better served.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second aspect of all this, and an area on which I have also been on the record over the years, is my grave concern that as a government we have been cranking up a situation of forcing people's savings into a very narrow investment area. This is not a criticism of funds managers. It is a fact of life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Managers of big funds do not set up branch offices to lend, for instance, $100,000 to a
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1569"> small business. In any direct sense, there are not a lot of them involved in home lending, although some have become involved. The reality is that they operate in the high, big volume end of the market. They deal on the stock exchange; they deal in the futures market; and they play the money markets around the world. They are investors at that end.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is nothing wrong with that, except that we have actually set out with the SGC to achieve a situation where many people are abandoning their old practices with the savings bank account, on which many of the older members of this House were raised, and have said, `I do not need to have those sorts of savings any more because I have my superannuation guarantee money going somewhere.' The problem, therefore, is that that has represented an erosion of the funds entering the banking system to be on-lent to those who set out in our community to borrow money and build something, be it a business or a home or whatever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This particular proposal puts that situation back in some balance. It creates an opportunity for banks to compete for savings which they will on-lend to an entirely different market from what a superannuation fund manager would do. I think that is extremely important. I also think we should look at some of the investment practices involved by banks and, for instance, funds managers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also on the record here as pointing out my grave concerns as to how those who invest regularly in the share market make their profits. It is a pretty simple process; you just keep cranking up the price of the shares you hold already. When you can deal on the market in billions and you hold, for example, a very large portfolio of BHP shares, if it is getting towards the end of the financial year and you are a bit dissatisfied with the returns you are going to declare, there is nothing to stop you going into the market and bidding up the price of BHP shares and revaluing every one in your portfolio. All of a sudden you declare wonderful returns. I am afraid that incentive is there for operators in that marketplace, and it is best described as `funny money'. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a thing about the share market known as the price earnings ratio, that is, the price of the shares relative to their earnings. One would think that a price earnings ratio of 12, which equates to an eight per cent earning rate, would be as high as the market should ever go. Yet, of course, in America today we read of transactions where that price earnings ratio is as high as 20 and 30, meaning the sale has gone through at a three per cent earning ratio.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This puts to bed a little the arguments put by the member for Denison. The reality is that he wanted to paint us a picture that if they put it in the bank, they could not earn money and, of course, if they put it in funds management, they could. There are a few people in this House who got letters from their superannuation companies a few years ago notifying them of a massive erosion in their superannuation reserves simply because those speculators in some of these marketplaces&mdash;which is what the big funds rely on&mdash;had got it wrong on the bond market and they had lost a packet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, it is occurring at that funny money end of the market, the derivatives. I find derivatives a rather remarkable situation. Take futures as an example. Futures were brought in originally for a very proper purpose. For example, in the wool industry when a wool grower had to meet certain financial commitments at a particular time of the year, about shearing time, he would sell a contract on the futures market to guarantee a certain price for his wool. He knew very well when he did that that the market price at that time might be higher or lower than the price that he accepted when he took out his contract. That was not the point. The point of the contract was to have enough money at that time to meet his financial commitment, and he took the risk on the price.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time, out there in the real world was a manufacturer who had a contract to provide uniforms to the army who wanted to fix the price of the wool that was going into that product, and it suited him for that reason to buy that farmer's contract. That was a very proper activity. However, these people who handle these huge sums of money found
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1570"> that that was also a wonderful opportunity to gamble, to pit their skills against the marketplace. The other two people were not gambling, they were taking astute business decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, those are the markets that these big investors play to deliver these wonderful dividends that the member for Denison wants to tell us every pensioner is going to get, provided their current SGC goes into superannuation fund management. There is no guarantee of that and there is quite recent evidence that it does not work that way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not about taking away from the super funds. If they are doing a good job there will be plenty of people wanting to take that option. It is all about granting another option to people seeking alternatives for their retirement income. It is a system that allows people in itinerant and part&hyphen;time work to identify a fund that will at least stand still.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It gives women a great opportunity when they leave the work force for family reasons but with plans to rejoin it at a later date to know that when they rejoin, the management fees of the funds that they had previously contributed to have not caused their previous savings to be eroded. It gives them an opportunity to put their savings on hold and, consequently, they can come back into the workplace some years later and start building on that amount of money again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are all good reasons. That is why this parliament should support this particular proposal. As I have said, that is as far as the consumer goes. The member for Denison tells us that the consumer organisations do not like it. Unfortunately, like so many other things in our nation today, very often good people start off worthy organisations but there is always a political fringe that wants to infiltrate them. I am afraid that a lot of consumer organisations today, just by their rhetoric, do not have the consumers' interests at heart but see it as a platform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was astounded the other day to hear a consumer advocate in America telling us that they would not buy our beef if we did not use government meat inspectors, and then we discovered that he was a meat inspector. He had got himself to the top of this so&hyphen;called
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> consumer organisation. What an outrageous situation!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that people are not silly. The market today, through the media, provides massive amounts of financial advice on where the good deals are. It is almost part of the regular nightly news. People can get that information and they can make judgments, but for many people there has been no choice. In fact, their only choice has been a bad choice because they could not get the sort of funding they needed due to their style of employment and their entire superannuation savings were eroded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This particular proposal reverses that. It gives people an opportunity. But, more importantly, it directs some of our national savings to the banking industry which, of course, is the lender to small business and is the lender to many people who cannot get the same accommodation from the superannuation funds management. That particular point must be understood. It might be that out of all this we get a situation where there is less money for speculation and more money for genuine investment in factories, buildings, machinery and all the things that banks finance which are so necessary for our economic growth.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not had the opportunity of reading the report to which the honourable member for Oxley referred. I would, however, take the opportunity of saying one or two things about the concepts she canvassed in her question. The first thing I would say is that this government believes very strongly in the concept that our society is one built on the notion of mutual obligation. That is, we as a society have an obligation&mdash;those of us who are in work; those of us who are more fortunate&mdash;to provide a decent standard of living, a decent safety net, for those in the community who are less fortunate. That is an absolute principle of the way in which my government will always approach social policy. I make no apology for that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very proud of the fact that the Liberal Party of Australia and the National Party of Australia through the years have pioneered many contributions to the safety net that Australians now properly expect of whatever government is in power. That will remain one of the proudest boasts of the Liberal Party of Australia, which I am honoured to lead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other side of the doctrine of mutual obligation is that those in the community who receive support from the rest of society reasonably can be asked, in appropriate and fair circumstances, to give something in return for that support that is provided. That, of course, was the principle that underlay the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> work for the dole concept that I announced a couple of weeks ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the reasons we announced the work for the dole approach was, in a reasonable fashion&mdash;not an unreasonable fashion&mdash;to address the possibility that there may be some disincentives in the present system. We, of course, had other and more compelling reasons for announcing it. Those other and more compelling reasons went to our desire to ensure that people did not remain for long periods of time on unemployment benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We think it is destructive of the human spirit to be out of work indefinitely. We think it is destructive of the human spirit to grow up in an environment where your parents and perhaps your grandparents have been unemployed. We think it is desirable for the government of this country to approach, in a multi-faceted way, policies designed to ensure that people do not sink into a lifetime of unemployment, do not sink into an attitude of indifference towards work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no one simple answer to that. I would say to the member for Oxley and I would say to all of the people of Australia that there is no one simple answer to that. You do not achieve that by slashing the dole. Equally, you do not achieve it by adopting the attitude that it is wrong to ask people to do something in return for the dole, which is apparently the attitude of the Australian Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that the only people in Australia who are now against the dole are the Australian Democrats and the Australian Labor Party. They are the only people. They don't believe in the doctrine of mutual obligation. They really don't. They had 13 years to demonstrate their commitment, and I will&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to inform the House that the government has every intention of fulfilling the election commitment to deliver tax rebates to Australians who take out private health insurance. I want all of those Australian families who are looking forward to that tax rebate to understand in very clear terms that the Liberal and National parties of Australia stand unqualifiedly in favour of delivering tax assistance
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and tax incentives to those in the Australian community who take out private health insurance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the process, I might remind those same Australian families that for 13 years the Labor Party refused to do anything about the problem of the haemorrhaging of Australia's private health insurance system. They refused to do anything about it, despite the warnings of Graham Richardson in 1993 that once you fell below 40 per cent you were really in trouble, that once you fell below 40 per cent you lost the critical mass that was required to keep the private health insurance system together.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite all of that, Paul Keating and the now Leader of the Opposition were able to roll Graham Richardson and say, `No, we will not allow you to introduce private health insurance incentives.' That is why last week the New South Wales Labor premier acknowledged the argument that the coalition has put when he said that the system is being swamped by the demands on it of people who dropped out of private health cover.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was also interested, in daily browsings through the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansards </EMPHASIS>of the parliaments of Australia, to come across a very interesting comment made in the Victorian parliament on 11 September 1996. The comment read as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the areas the federal government has had to address is the obviously increasing pressure on public hospitals. That pressure has risen for a number of reasons. One is our ageing population. The second reason is the number of people who have been leaving the private health system simply because they cannot afford it. Therefore the federal government has tried to introduce a system that will, firstly, reduce the flow of people leaving the health funds and, secondly, encourage people back into private health insurance. That is something that is long overdue. If it had been done by the previous federal Labor government, both Victoria and New South Wales would not be in the positions they are in today.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The speaker then went on to say what a terrific idea it was for the federal government to introduce taxation rebate. I find it interesting that those were the words of the Victorian Premier&mdash;the same Victorian Premier who yesterday said that it was a silly idea.</PARA>

They have experienced enormous difficulties in recent times. There is a lot that can be done by getting interest rates down and by meeting needs such as funding for drought policy. The western division is actually a prime example of a region that has specific problems relating to factors there such as it being a specialist wool&hyphen;growing area and having suffered many years of drought.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is capable of and is responding to the needs of hard&hyphen;hit regions of this sort. Last week in Cobar&mdash;the member himself was present&mdash;I signed a memorandum of understanding with the New South Wales government and local  land&hyphen;holders to be known as `West 2000'. Under West 2000, we
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> will be able to do a great deal to help a very hard&hyphen;hit area recover, find its feet and return itself to prosperity. It involves expenditure of $12&half; million of federal money. Combined with the state resources, it is a total of about $17&half; million for business management, productivity improvement, training and skills enhancement, development of alternative industries, further rural counselling, assistance for re&hyphen;establishment for those that find no future for themselves and want a dignified exit path, help for environmental values, particularly in relation to the encroachment of woody weeds and rabbit management, and help, too, in the area of natural resource management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But all members will be interested in another tragedy in the western division that is evident too widely across the broader Australian community, but particularly in rural areas, and that is the problem of youth suicide. Youth suicide rates in Australia are too high; by international standards they are alarmingly high. In conjunction with the minister for health, Michael Wooldridge, last Friday I launched a pilot rural youth suicide project as part of West 2000. The first of these pilot projects&mdash;there are, I think, to be five&mdash;will be set up in Bourke, which is in the honourable member for Parkes's electorate. In Bourke, which is assessed by the ABS as being one of the most disadvantaged communities in Australia, we have a young population suffering a real loss of hope in a depressed local economy.

I want to take the opportunity of telling the House that, when the final report of the Productivity Commission is received by the government, it will be addressed against a number of considerations.

Yesterday morning when the cleaners came to a building in this city a young man's body was found. He had taken his own life. Next to motor vehicle and motorcycle accidents, youth suicide is tragically the highest cause of death of young people in Australia, particularly of young men and Aboriginals. Unemployment, emotional distress, drugs and alcoholism are among the causes. I would like to ask the minister: is there a coordinated national policy to identify the causes of youth suicide? In particular, are there any steps now under way to develop a strategy both to provide some relief for those who feel that emotional pressure and to see whether there can be coordinated measures taken at a state and federal level to reduce that alarming statistic?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank my colleague the right honourable member for New England for that question. I know that it has been of particular concern to him. He is one of the members who has an electorate in rural and regional Australia where this is a particularly difficult problem. It is a fact that last year six people committed suicide each day. A total of 2,367 lives were lost in the year. This figure is around 16 per cent greater than the death toll from road accidents. In fact, it is rising.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday I was privileged to participate in the Wesley Mission's life force memorial service at the Opera House. It was relevant that the Reverend Bob Dunlop gave two very clear messages on that occasion. The first
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> message was that, if we can highlight this problem, if we can engage the community and make it understand just what a problem youth suicide is in this country, then we can indeed avert the incident of suicide. An active and alert community working in concert with government will go some the way towards resolving this terrible tragedy in our communities. The second message that of the Reverend Bob Dunlop gave was that we need to support those who are left behind, those whose lives have been shattered by this event.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is in recognition of this that very shortly after we came to government last year we announced that we would put in place a number of measures to try to combat these tragic figures. Our young people deserve support and understanding, so our government's national youth suicide prevention strategy will deliver programs across the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the right honourable member for New England quite rightly pointed out, there are very complex reasons why people take this terrible final step&mdash;and those reasons are many. It makes it very difficult, therefore, to propose a single measure that will prevent this tragedy occurring. In recognition of that, the program we have announced and the additional funding to the existing $13 million that has been available for the prevention of youth suicide will go towards a number of programs that will help rural and regional youth. That will provide a lifeline service and a kids help line so that our young people can ring up to get support and help. We know from the many accounts at yesterday's service that young people have been saved by being able to ring patient and wise counsellors on those lifeline and help line services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also implemented a program for parents. I found from talking to a number of parents at the ceremony yesterday that they were distressed that very few programs in the past recognised their lives were shattered and that they needed help and support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our program also includes education and training so that we can identify early the symptoms of suicide and seek to prevent it from occurring in the first place. This will be particularly directed at general practitioners
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1581"> and in the development of hospital protocols so that the problem can be identified early and the community can come together to try to give support and help. We have also set up an indigenous foundation in recognition of this serious problem within our Aboriginal communities, which have a much higher youth suicide rate than we in the general community have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe it will be through these services and with the help and assistance of the community at large that we will be able to stem the growing number of suicides in this country and to give the support to our young people and to our communities, particularly our rural communities, that they so desperately need.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

Indeed, I am pleased to be able to advise the House that, under the identified local roads funding component of financial assistance grants, very significant funds have been provided for local roads and bridges. In fact, for the 1996-97 financial year, there is an amount of $372 million, 75 per cent of which is to be spent on rural and regional roads and bridges. This is of course in addition to the amount of money spent under the Commonwealth roads program&mdash;about $803 million a year&mdash;90 per cent of which is spent on regional and rural roads. So the amount of Commonwealth money for those roads is over a billion dollars.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The money coming from the financial assistance grants, as I have explained to the House previously, increased in this financial year by four per cent.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the honourable member's electorate, the electorate of Leichhardt, which takes in an enormous area, I am advised that the figure this financial year is in the vicinity of four per cent.

If you have, can you explain the apparent inconsistency between your decision and the government's successful submission to the High Court that China's one child policy cannot form grounds for the grant of refugee status? Do you accept that the impression that the government has effectively overridden the High Court decision requires you to clarify this matter without delay? What is the Australian government's position with respect to the potentially unlimited pipeline of applicants who may wish to apply for these kinds of decisions?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The simple fact is that in this matter the government and its decision makers, including the Refugee Review Tribunal, must apply the refugee convention. The High Court's recent decision concerning an important aspect of that convention&mdash;namely, what constitutes a particular social group&mdash;is of course welcome. The High Court clarified that matter in the context of a case involving China's one child policy. The court determined that merely because a person is the subject of a policy does not of itself make him or her a refugee. The government obviously welcomes this decision which clarifies the law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Denison has regrettably confused this High Court decision with the minister's non-compellable discretion. He has shown no understanding of the difference between the refugee decision making and the exercise of ministerial discretion. He seems to be suggesting that I intend to use my discretion to override the principle established by the High Court. That is completely wrong. My discretion is only accessible after people have exercised all other application remedies, including decisions by the Refugee Review Tribunal. In exercising the discretion, I am able to look at the range of issues that are relevant to a particular case.</PARA>

There are at least 250,000 jobs associated one way or another with the car industry, either directly, to the tune of about 50,000 jobs, or indirectly, adding another 200,000 to that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA STYLE="Para">There is no question at all that at the centre of Australian manufacturing industry lies the car industry&mdash;no question at all&mdash;at its very heart. Australian manufacturing industry relies in its totality upon a healthy car industry for its survival. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in his answer to me in question time today suggested that people ought to have regard to other areas of Labor Party policy on the car industry. I suppose I could have invited him at that time&mdash;if they were going to take on board any particular undertakings that the Prime Minister was prepared to give to the car industry in the answer he gave&mdash;to have regard to the promises the Liberal Party made on child care, education, health and to the university students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We would not ask them to have regard to either our general policy or your general policy or promises as far as this is concerned. We would ask the Australian people to have regard to the experience of the car industry whilst we were in office. Despite the health of the car industry at the conclusion of our period of office and the fact that it looked forward, as we reviewed the progress of that car industry, to an environment which respected their massive achievements in the restructuring that they have undergone over the last decade to be honoured by governments subsequent to this, their progress in that regard has been remarkable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the course of the last decade the car industry has led the way in what has been quite a stunning turnaround in the performance of Australian manufacturing industry. Let me go through the total manufacturing sector and then I will go to the car industry to give an impression or understanding to people who may be listening to this debate of the absolutely vital significance the car industry is to us. Let me go first generally into manufacturing industry. In 1983-84 when we came into office, the value of manufactured exports to this nation was about $5 billion&mdash;about 20 per cent of total exports. By 1993-94 this had risen to about $20 billion&mdash;30.8 per cent of exports&mdash;and in very rapid rises in 1995-96 to $25 billion&mdash;33 per cent of exports. That is an extraordinary rate of
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1591"> increase in manufactured industry export in that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It reflected the fact that the structural changes that we put in place changed the orientation of Australian manufacturing industry. It told them when we put those changes in place that what we expected from Australian manufacturing industry was world best practice in efficiency and export performance. Then, if we got that world best practice, they would be rewarded by the sort of support from government that they now enjoy. In part that is based on tariffs; in part it is based on export facilitation. There are a number of other elements to it. That means that now the Australian car industry is supported by&mdash;effectively performs but is supported by&mdash;one of the lowest levels of government support of any of its competitors&mdash;probably the lowest level of government support of any of its competitors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also recognise that you reach a point when you have to take a decision this far and no further. If there is going to be any further movement we expect a reciprocal arrangement. From this point on, nothing for nothing. From this point on, what do we expect from those with whom we compete and what do we expect in the international trading arrangements? Not one inch&mdash;until we see people prepared to go the miles that we have gone in giving them access to our markets and in the process making a very substantial difference in the efficiency of our industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a major test of the government's bona fides. It loves to clothe itself in a defence of the battlers, but the problem of this government is that it has absolutely no comprehension of what real public policy means in manufacturing industry and in the car industry in general&mdash;no understanding at all. One of the reasons why we are now concerned about what the government's approach to this will be is that in the course of the last 12 months we have seen the most massive dismantling of sensibly based industry policy that this country has seen. There has been a massive dismantling in 12 months flat over this government's period of office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the most amazing feature of that massive dismantling is that it is not been accom
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> panied by an explanation as to why that should be so in industry terms. We have heard arguments from them about a budget situation which has largely been bogus in the argument that has been put forward about it. This country has one of lowest levels of public indebtedness. When this government came into office it had one of the best budgetary positions enjoyed by any government in the industrialised world&mdash;a budgetary position which contrasts, I might say, with a $25 billion deficit in today's dollar terms that we confronted when we came into office. Nevertheless, we were able, with that $25 billion deficit, to put in place a series of support mechanisms that encouraged the car industry and manufacturing industry generally to be outward looking and internationally competitive&mdash;but also, in return, on a basis of mutual obligation, that relevant support mechanisms were put in place by the government to keep them going.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Every single one of those support mechanisms has been demonised. The Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore), who is at the table, bears responsibility for that. We have had the Treasurer (Mr Costello) stand up in this place time and again and say, `Look, what we have done to syndicated R&amp;D and what we have done to these arrangements of business tax concessions represents our attack on the big end of town. While we are slugging the battlers for their prescriptions, their child care and destroying their kids' chances of an opportunity, don't worry about that because we are slugging the big end of town.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The big end of town would be slugged if the big end of town was actually finding that massive tax evasion associated with those pass throughs on family trusts being addressed. That real big end of town element of it has a feather duster taken out to it. When the big end of town decides to do a bit of investing in decent R&amp;D the axe comes out there and slashes right through those propositions as industry policy gets dismantled piecemeal without argument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, as we see the approach of this government to the position of the Productivity Commission, given the song and dance that
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1592"> went into the creation of the Productivity Commission, given the amount of personal effort invested in the Productivity Commission by the Treasurer, we are entitled to suspect that if there has been that level of ignorance on industry policy to this point associated with the Productivity Commission we can expect a bit more ignorance unless we start to bell the cat, unless we start to put down a set of markers that make you start to understand that there are political costs to be borne.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Talking about battlers and battlers' newspapers, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald&hyphen;Sun</EMPHASIS> editorial today makes some useful reading on that path. It says this in the course of its editorial:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Labor announcement emerged as a shrewd political manoeuvre, leaving the Howard Cabinet with little alternative other than to adopt the same position, and reject the Industry Commission's zero tariff proposal for the period beyond 2000, when the matter comes before ministers soon.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Shrewd political manoeuvre&mdash;dead right. They have got it in one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are trying to do in this exercise is to box you, to put you in a position where you have no alternative but to make absolutely certain that you act in the way you should on the Productivity Commission as it comes forward, and act with a total rejection. You know very well that if you fail to do that massive damage is going to be done to the car industry, massive damage is going to be done to the manufacturing industry, and massive damage is also going to be done to the survival of the state of Victoria. That is a situation which would simply be completely unacceptable as far as we are concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has been the response? I spoke a bit earlier about the general performance of the manufacturing industry while we were in office. What has been the response specifically of the car industry&mdash;this industry which is now under threat, as every single car manufacturer has pointed out, from the recommendations that have thus far come forward from the Productivity Commission?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me just go through exports because what we attempted to do when we were in office was to ensure that there was a quality performance from the car industry and ensure
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that that quality performance was reflected in exports and therefore they would have a long-term possibility of survival. They responded magnificently. The value of car exports in 1984 was $383 million. By 1988 they were up to $659 million&mdash;a 72 per cent increase over that period. By 1992 they were up to $1.25 billion&mdash;a 226 per cent increase. By 1995 they were up to $1.776 billion&mdash;a 363 per cent increase. That was a 363 per cent increase in the export performance of the car industry over the period of time that we were in office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were hard adjustments taken by the car industry but what the car industry did in that period of time was change its structure. From being intensely focused on about four or five manufacturers at that point of time, it spread itself out to encourage what has been a massive development of a  component industry associated with it. That component industry is performing not only domestically but internationally as well. Let me tell you something about that component industry as it performs internationally. When we made our announcements on our policy we were in a factory in which virtually 80 per cent of what it does is exported and you can go through virtually every area of the component industry and find that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we have also found as we have gone around the country talking to people about the sorts of problems they confront that virtually every single one of those folk engaged in that component industry confronts new competition being brought into the region around it, sometimes on the basis of Australian investment we are producing here. It is brought into areas where, from their point of view, they are getting a better level of government support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I heard the Deputy Prime Minister arguing consistently against us that somehow or other this would create problems for us in APEC, that somehow or other we would have difficulties with that. So let me just go through what those component manufacturers and the car industry face in terms of import restrictions. I will go through each of the APEC countries: Vietnam, 60 to 200 per cent; Brunei, 40 to 200 per cent; South Korea, 25
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1593"> to 100 per cent; India, 65 per cent; Singapore, 45 per cent; Malaysia, 5 to 200 per cent; Philippines, 30 per cent; Taiwan, 30 to 50 per cent; Thailand, 20 to 200 per cent; China, 110 to 150 per cent; Indonesia, 100 per cent; USA, cars 5 per cent, trucks 25 per cent; New Zealand, 25 per cent though we get access under CER.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point about all of that is this: APEC does not expect nothing for nothing in the positions that they put. They pointed out quite clearly under the Osaka action plan APEC economies will endeavour to ensure overall comparability of their trade and investment liberalisation and facilitation, taking into account the general level of liberalisation and facilitation already achieved by each APEC economy. That is exactly the point. It is nothing for nothing from this point on as far as the car industry is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We intend to see that a car industry in this nation survives. The proposals that we have put forward to extend that tariff support to at least 2005 will do that. The proposals will be put under review in 2003 when that review will have, as its focus, what are the others doing, what about regional Australia and what does regional Australia need? We will be making an Australian national decision on what is necessary for the car industry at that point of time in 2003.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will leave it to our spokesman on industry matters to talk more about the detail of the position and decisions we have taken.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is quite a remarkable somersault by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley). I will quote a couple of things he had to say: `Not one inch are we going to move', and `Nothing for nothing'. A press release from the Leader of the Opposition of 14 July 1995 states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The tariff reduction program and consequent industry restructuring have given rise to more competitive exporters in important sectors, including the car industry and textiles, clothing and footwear.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What a somersault! He talked about what they were going to do to APEC, reminding everyone that they were going to stand up to all the APEC people around the place and that nothing was going to give. In November 1996, just around the corner, Mr Beazley said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important for most APEC meetings to send a strong message to the WTO that APEC would not be backing away from its goals because unless the WTO ministerial meeting sends a strong message that economic liberalisation will continue, I believe we are in danger of seeing a return to a more protectionist world. As the countries of the Asia&hyphen;Pacific know only too well, it will be in nobody's interest.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Quite clearly, the poor old Leader of the Opposition has been feeling the heat. All those who saw the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS>  program earlier this week could not have been anything but very impressed. When I watched it I couldn't help thinking, `What are they going to do? What is the instant reaction to this, because it is going to sting a bit.' The Old Labor and the New Labor and all those sorts of things have been talked about. I thought, `They will pull a stunt somewhere for sure.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One thing about the current leadership of the Labor Party is that they are all part of the chardonnay set. They are far removed from the real workers of the world. The member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith (Mr Brereton) is the leading chardonnay sipper in town. Other members here go to lunch in Rolls Royces.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There had to be a stunt, and the chardonnay set of the leadership decided that it had to be for Old Labor. So they thought, `We'll move on down to Adelaide, with things a bit tough down there, and we'll put on a little show.' It
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1594"> had all the hallmarks of the member for Hotham (Mr Crean). He thought this one up. This is one of his little opportunist plays he puts together. He thought it up and did it in conjunction with the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson). They put their minds together to produce this little plot for Adelaide. So off they went.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we saw that part of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> program where they interviewed the member for Hotham and asked him about his leadership aspirations. He said, `Well, it might be down the road a bit.' The Leader of the Opposition saw that and he thought, `No open road for Crean,' and thought he had better go to the show as well. So he hopped on down to Adelaide, blustered away and put out this news statement about motor cars&mdash;totally contradicting his own personal positions of the last 10 years. He contradicted every statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Keating was Prime Minister, it was well known that he walked all over the member for Hotham. The Leader of the Opposition would not stand up for this sort of stuff, would he. But no, he went right along with it. Even in November 1996 he was still supporting the hard, dry line. We were very interested to see all those situations. I am surprised today to see the bluster going on. No doubt this was all driven by the fact that their effort in Adelaide yesterday got remarkably little press.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having failed yesterday, they rushed us into the House this afternoon for an MPI led by the Leader of the Opposition and backed up by the conscience man&mdash;the guy who is looking to the leadership in the future. He is going to come in behind his leader and see if he can get a better run this time. I don't think he will.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important at the outset that the House understand the context in which the future of
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the motor car industry is being considered. Shortly after coming to government, the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and I asked the Industry Commission to examine the motor vehicle industry. This is the usual process followed by the government when it is reviewing an industry, an approach supported by the Labor Party when in government. As part of the Industry Commission's process, the government appointed an associate commissioner with a background and experience in the industry to be part of the examining panel of that industry&mdash;something Labor never did.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In line with its usual practice, the Industry Commission produced a draft report for public comment shortly before Christmas. The commission is now conducting further public hearings prior to producing a final report about the middle of this year. It is this final report that will be considered by cabinet and to which the government will formally reply. In other words, it would be premature for the government to announce its decision on the future of the motor vehicle industry until the final report of the Productivity Commission has been received. Could you imagine the outcry from the Labor Party if we jumped in and pre-empted the final report of the commission?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has made two things very clear. The report of the Productivity Commission will be only one of the factors considered by the government before making its decision. We are committed to consulting widely with industry and others with an interest in the industry, including the trade unions and state governments. Secondly, both the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and I have clearly stated that the government regards the retention of a strong and internationally competitive car industry as being very important and that it is the intention of the government to encourage the development and growth of a strong car industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, the only reason the opposition has chosen now to enter the debate is desperation. The workers have deserted the Labor Party and are showing no signs of returning. So what does Labor do? It pinches the substance of the minority report drafted by the commis
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1595"> sion which, by the way, only exists because this government&mdash;not the previous Labor government&mdash;permitted industry representatives to sit directly on the commission's panel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor pinches the minority draft report, rebadges it and tries to pass it off as its own policy, just as it has done consistently over the past six months as it attempts to redefine itself&mdash;just as the member for Hotham rebadged Australia Reconstructed as his grand vision for industry; just as he rebadged the metal trade union's `Policy for industry development and more jobs' as his model for a MITI style industry department.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Leader of the Opposition has finally got off the pot. In the debate between the member for Hotham and the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans) on the future direction of Labor's economic policy, the Leader of the Opposition has come down on the side of the member for Hotham. It is a pity that he hadn't been so decisive in government. The Leader of the Opposition and the member for Hotham have plenty of courage and bounce now. It is a pity they didn't demonstrate that same fortitude in
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> staring down former Prime Minister Keating. As the Prime Minister said at question time, `Don't forget the Commonwealth Bank.' The Labor Party will promise the world in opposition; it won't deliver in government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What exactly was Labor's record? I can tell you it was appalling. In 1984, shortly after Labor came to office, car production in Australia stood at around 370,000 units. When they left office in 1996, production was just 314,000. In the interim, Nissan closed down production and Australia largely lost the capacity to produce small cars like the Ford Laser. In 1984, import penetration was around 20 per cent. In 1996, as a result of their policies in government, this exceeded 50 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under Labor, employment in the industry declined from around 70,000 to around 45,000, despite all the bluster of a couple of days ago. It is little wonder that the workers detest them. Labor had promised the automotive industry cost savings to be won from micro&hyphen;economic reform, which would have offset the effects of declining tariffs but which never materialised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Productivity Commission, in its December 1996 draft report on the automotive industry, noted that progress had been especially slow in labour market reform, government regulations and in the economic infrastructure supporting the industry, especially the waterfront&mdash;that is one for everyone to remember&mdash;shipping and rail transport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note the Leader of the Opposition favours a pause in tariffs and a review prior to resuming their reductions, while also insisting that we maintain our commitments under APEC. He might specify how these contradictory objectives could be achieved. They certainly contradict his comments as a minister. He might also indicate how certainty could be maintained for the purposes of planning investment in the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government recognises that the car industry plays a very significant role in the Australian economy. It is a major employer. Nearly 50,000 Australians are directly employed in the industry. Many more rely on employment generated by the demand that the car industry creates. It is a major producer of
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1596"> value added exports. Exports have grown strongly in real terms in recent years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The car industry achieves exports worth around $2 billion, with scope for considerable growth if the industry is able to achieve improved access to regional markets. It is a major source of investment. Apart from the four major car producers, there are some 200 individual companies producing and supplying components within the industry. It is an important source of innovation and engineering expertise. Combined, the car industry generates nearly $250 million in business expenditure on R&amp;D.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has set in train a comprehensive process to review post&hyphen;2000 arrangements for this industry. The Productivity Commission has its terms of reference. It has produced a draft report. It is continuing with its reference and will release its final report in May.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth noting that, in establishing this Production Commission inquiry, the government ensured that the pragmatic considerations of industry are represented on the commission in the person of Ian Webber. This has undoubtedly strengthened the review process. It has brought a diversity of opinion to the commission and forced the commission to re&hyphen;examine its traditional methods of analysis and argument. This is reflected by the fact that the commission's draft report contains both majority and minority recommendations on certain points.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I mentioned, the commission is just one source of advice to the government in the review process. When we came to office last year, I established the Automotive Manufacturing Council comprising representatives of the four car majors, component producers and car importers. That council has met on at least three or four occasions since the commencement of the review, both with myself and with the Minister for Trade, the Hon. Tim Fischer. It has a comprehensive work program addressing the long&hyphen;term vision of the industry, productivity, innovation, the size and structure of the domestic market and export opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is responsibly developing a vision and a strategy that will put the car
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> industry on a competitive footing well into the next century. But we will let the process run its course. We will not be pre&hyphen;empting the outcome of the review process. The Leader of the Opposition should specify the modifications he thinks are necessary to ensure the export trade facilitation scheme remains consistent with the World Trade Organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party's proposals for the car industry must be seen as part of the opposition's record on industry policy as a whole. This is the party that tinkered with the sectional policies while ignoring the fundamentals of industry and the economy in general. This is the party that spent 13 years propping up their mates while the rest of industry struggled under high inflation, record high interest rates and record low business investment. It is a party which failed to develop a vision for stable job growth. The Labor Party was the great job destroyer. It is the party of high unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor's recession caused the worst unemployment in 60 years. Only four years ago, under a Labor Party government, unemployment stood at the rate of 11.2 per cent, with youth unemployment over 26 per cent. Labor rhetoric, including the member for Hotham's grand vision for industry, has always been full of lofty predictions about confronting unemployment. The truth is that, in the manufacturing sector, 200,000 jobs were lost in the last six years of the Labor government and no net growth in employment has been seen for 11 years. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

The minister stumbles through his speech, revelations occurring to him as to what happens to be the car industry plan in this country as he stumbles out over the export facilitation scheme. It is a revelation! He did not know it existed before he read it. This is the person that has got charge of the car industry in this country. But it does not stop there: he has got

He is the person that made a promise to create 200,000 new jobs in manufacturing, and he is presiding over the demise of manufacturing industry. He scurries from the chamber because he will not participate in the debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is this industry is in crisis because of the government's inaction, because of the conflicting signals coming from the government and because of the National Party, that really cannot make up its mind. It wants to reduce car tariffs, but it wants to keep sugar tariffs up. Don't you think there is an inconsistency? You don't! But this is the way you go round the country. This is the Deputy Leader of the National Party, the member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), sitting on the front bench, and the Leader of the National Party, Tim Fischer, who has been lambasted all around this country by Hendy Cowan, by Bob Borbidge and by his state ministers who all say, `Tim Fischer, where are you leading us?' Total confusion. We have seen the confusion from Tim Fischer, but no more evident than over this stupid ideological position on tariffs. Cut them for manufacturing, but keep them up for rural resources. That is your position: inconsistent&mdash;and the reason you could never get a trade agreement through the international forums.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We as a Labor government knew that if we were to get access for rural commodities we had to do the right thing in manufacturing. We did have to reduce our tariff level. But, if we were moving from a tariff protected industry, we had to support the export growth of industries. That was why we had the car plan: a plan that did reduce tariffs, but at the same time supported export growth. Hence, the export facilitation scheme. The non&hyphen;appearing minister has just stumbled across what he never knew existed&mdash;the car plan to get exports up. What we have got is a split within the government.</PARA>

They had the opportunity the other day in the debate on the productivity bill, and they squibbed it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In contrast to this total confusion, this misunderstood position by the minister, Labor does have a plan. Labor announced that plan yesterday in Adelaide. What does that plan involve? It involves a freeze on the tariff on motor vehicles at 15 per cent, until at least the year 2005, whilst maintaining our commitment to APEC. The minister who is confused about the export facilitation scheme cannot work out either how we can keep this commitment to APEC. I would tell him why if he were only here&mdash;it is a bit hard talking to this empty box. But I am sure he is back in his room listening to every word, so I will explain it to him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is Australia is well ahead of its trading partners in APEC. Its commitment to 15 per cent beats any one hands down. We said, `We will maintain that commitment but, before we go any further, we want you to do the same.' No unilateral disarmament here. We are not going out doing something for nothing. If the other countries do honour their commitments, then we will review that position past 2005. But, as it stands, we will be ahead of any of them&mdash;even up until the year 2005. That is how your so&hyphen;called contradiction is explained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, we will take a sensible step: we will say that, in the review that takes place, we will require a transparent measure of what other countries are doing so that we can see if they are improving. This was an amendment we moved in the House to the Productivity Commission bill. It is the rhetoric that some from South Australia go on with. But, when we moved the amendment, where were they? They voted it down, as they voted down the legislative requirement that when the Productivity Commission makes a decision it has got to have regard to the impact of its decision on regions. They come in here and
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1598"> talk about the importance of regional development. But, given the opportunity to vote for regions, they vote them down&mdash;they vote against them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also said that we want to keep the export facilitation scheme. We understand what it is&mdash;we put it in place. But the minister bumbles over it because it is a revelation to him today. We have also said we will continue the duty&hyphen;free allowance, and we have said that we will reverse the stupid decisions that have seen research and development cut in this country. What has been the industry response to this plan? They have said that if this plan is introduced&mdash;understand this, because this is not just about protecting existing jobs; it is about growing the industry&mdash;if this plan is put in place, we will get 10,000 extra new jobs. We will treble exports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thought this was a government that wanted to correct the balance of payments and create jobs&mdash;yet they will vote against this plan. This is a perfect plan to correct the balance of payments and address the current account, and it is great for jobs, yet you cannot see it. You do not know what is looking you in the face. That is why we want to expose you. We have also seen the response of the government. What is the response of the government to this position? The minister comes into this place, inanely rambling through. Do you know what his opening line was in response to the speech by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley)? It referred to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> on Monday night. Well should the member for Ryan remember <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS>. It was on the Marion Wilkinson <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> program where he exposed, with the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), his plot to bring down the current Prime Minister  when he was formerly a Leader of the Opposition. He was there crowing on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> how he had plotted to bring down the leader of his party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I was listening to the minister today&mdash;I have heard him before in debate on this matter&mdash;standing there, oblivious to what is going on in the world and saying, `Oh, you know, those Labor boys, they're up to some silly stunt, we'll wait and see what the Productivity Commission does', it reminded me

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have heard the Laurel and Hardy act from the opposition over there to beat all. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) makes performers from the Flying Fruit Fly Circus look like absolute  amateurs. Talk about a
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1599"> flip&hyphen;flop. We are here to discuss an important and serious issue this afternoon&mdash;that is, tariffs in the car industry into the next millennium. There are a number of significant points that I would like to discuss in the brief time available: firstly, that tariffs make us lazy; secondly, that they create economic distortions; thirdly, that the automotive industry is critical to manufacturing in Australia; fourthly, that we need to seriously address micro&hyphen;economic reform and offsets; and, lastly, that we need to adhere to our APEC obligations which we committed to at Bogor.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Do tariffs make us lazy? Yes, they do. When you look back in history, if you think about the chemical industry in Australia, I am advised that most of our current chemical plants are undersized for what they might be if they were to be truly internationally competitive and able proficiently and efficiently to produce product in Australia and sell it competitively on world markets. Why are they undersized? Because they were built behind a huge tariff barrier which encouraged less efficient and less productive enterprise to be constructed. It is pretty hard to overcome that negative factor 20 or 30 years down the track, but they are trying.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, is our automotive industry one of the highest protected industries not only in Australia but around the world? We decided that in order to make a good motor car and give Australians access to transportation cheaply and inexpensively, we would progressively build a tariff wall. What we built was a highly inefficient, structured industry that was overcommitted to a centralised wage system and with taxes paid by Australian consumers for imported motor cars, which meant that Australian domestic cars were more expensive. The honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean) talks about there being a crisis in the automotive industry. He amazes me. I did not know there was a crisis. I thought the automotive industry was going from strength to strength today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We talk about economic distortion. Taxes create huge economic distortions. Look at the wholesale sales tax and payroll tax. When the opposition was in government and brought in a surcharge for luxury automobiles, what
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> happened with the surcharge? We did not collect more money. Fewer people could buy luxury motor cars and the tax return from that wholesale sales tax surcharge initiative went down. So Keating had to give up and withdraw the tax surcharge because he killed the goose that laid the golden egg.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tariffs are an impost on business inputs. That is an important point to make. I think that when the Labor Party was in government they actually understood this. The program of gradual reduction in import tariffs over a period of time was supported by this side of the House. I have congratulated the ALP in this place time and time again on gradually reducing the tariff wall. What I do not understand is the huge backflip we saw yesterday and today by the Leader of the Opposition, supported by the member for Hotham, in saying, `Well, we can stop now. This is good enough. We will pause. We will quit the phased reduction of tariffs and see what happens to the industry.' I will tell you what will happen. We will just keep going on as in the bad old days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am indebted to the member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) for some important data with respect to the industry. Profits in passenger motor vehicle manufacturing for 1995 were $340 million. Profits in the component industry have been positive every year since 1989-90. Output per worker in the automotive industry has risen from $75,000 in 1991 to $116,000 today. Cars per employee has risen from 10.83 in 1991 to 15.96 in 1995, while output per worker in the component industry went from $125,300 in 1991 to $179,500 in 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I could go on, but time precludes me from reading all the statistics. The important thing to recognise is that we created an industry that was dependent on the  centralised wage system and on tariffs. Do honourable members know what would happen? When the industry faced a little cost pressure because the CPI, the cost of living, was going up, it would go to the Tariff Board and say, `We've got to have an increase in tariffs. We want Australians to pay more taxes for motor cars that are imported from other countries,' and the Tariff Board would say, `You're right; the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1600"> CPI has gone up,' and would increase tariffs; then the union would go to the then Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and say, `The industry has put up the cost of motor cars, so we will have to have a wage increase,' and the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission would say, `You're right,' and put up wages; and then the industry would go back to the Tariff Board and say, `The union just got a wage rise. We are going to have to have another increase in tariffs.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That went on and on, and we built behind that tariff wall one of the most inefficient, most defect prone and worst quality automotive manufacturing industries in the world. I will tell honourable members what reducing tariffs has done to the industry: it has put enormous pressure on them, their work force and their unions to revitalise their operations to try to become efficient, with capital expenditure and without it. They still have a long way to go to reach world's best practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Button car plan did one thing: it helped reduce the number of manufacturers and it helped reduce the number of models available. Some friends and I were talking only last night about all the options we used to have. We could have every colour in the rainbow and every option possible. We paid a fortune for those options and frequently people had to take their automobiles back time and again before they would work properly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not have those kinds of problems today, but in the Button car plan the Labor Party forgot about small cars, so we are now importing a huge number of small to medium sized cars made in other countries. We depend largely on larger motor cars&mdash;the six&hyphen;cylinder variety. That is a shame but, nonetheless, the industry is performing, it is becoming more efficient and it is growing. So there is a lot to be said for a low or no tariff position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister (Mr Howard), when in opposition, said in one of his headland speeches:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are not advocating turning back the clock on tariffs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Higher tariffs are not the solution to the current account problem.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They may look like a free lunch but ultimately, it's the consumers who pay through higher prices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other industries also pay through inflated input costs.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Later he makes the important point:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have consistently stated that tariff reform must proceed in step with other reforms to reduce business costs and boost competitiveness.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think that is an absolutely perfect position. I have said consistently that we need to continue with so-called micro&hyphen;economic reform. We need lower utility costs, we need lower transport costs and we certainly need&mdash;the member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton), who is at the table, knows I have said this time and again&mdash;lower costs on the wharves and lower costs in coastal shipping. Those high costs are such an impost on industry that I cannot describe to the House the detrimental effect they have. We need to deal with all of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Hotham, who spoke before me, said on 8 November 1990:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we are winding back the protective wall that the tariff produces because the real problem with the tariff is that it only makes us look internally, domestically.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The member for Hotham was right, so why is he now doing a backflip? He is doing a Flying Fruit Fly Circus act. I cannot understand why the ALP is taking a populist line rather than waiting for the Productivity Commission's, the Industry Commission's, report. I congratulate the minister for including Ian Webber in that commission, but why don't we wait for the report?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my view, in the absence of that we have to continue the tariff reduction regime on a predictable basis and at least say that we will reach the Bogor target of 2010. We have a responsibility to meet our obligations in our region. We said to APEC that by 2010 Australia will have no impediments to imports to our country. We need to work hard to create better markets for our products overseas, but we will not win this war until our industry is efficient and productive. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule 1, Part 3, page 11 (line 2) to page 13 (line 18), omit the Part.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I indicated yesterday in the debate on this particular bill when it was in this chamber before going to the Main Committee for further consideration that it was the intention of the opposition to move this amendment which has been circulated in my name. This amendment, as I indicated yesterday, goes to the issue of rent assistance for singles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Without delaying the House too long, I simply reiterate that the reason we are doing this is for consistency in respect of the approach that the opposition has taken with regard to this as a social security measure. We have also again indicated that we recognise this as being a broken promise, and the fact that it would affect only 340 people for the saving over four years of some $21,000 seems to us to be somewhat ridiculous. The amendment I have moved on behalf of the opposition is to omit that part.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, I am not going to delay the afternoon's proceedings in the parliament, because I have spoken with the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) about this. I have indicated that the rest of the bill certainly meets with the satisfaction of the opposition. We have congratulated the government on taking necessary action to repair one or two areas where it was felt appropriate to do so.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, again, I just simply say to my friend the minister: keep an eye on the Department of Social Security. I start to worry when they do a few of these little things. They seem to mount up to a major thing at the end of the day. I would not like to see the role that the minister has played and his department has played in maintaining the very high standards for veterans in this community of ours eroded in any way. But we consider this amendment to be important.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">As was stated this morning by the shadow minister for veterans' affairs, these amendments, which have been circulated, have the support of the opposition. While endorsing our bill and its amendments, I would just take the opportunity to thank those who have
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> spoken in the debate. However, before doing so, I just point out to the House that today we celebrate the 96th anniversary of the Australian Army, which I believe demonstrates our commitment to the defence forces of this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Commenting on the amendment relating to shared accommodation, I would point out to all members on both sides of the House that the proposal will not affect members of a couple or people with dependent children, and that it certainly will not affect people in residential care. I would also point out that our legislative amendments will provide sufficient flexibility for the Repatriation Commission to assess individual rental arrangements to ensure that people who have similar living expenses to those of a single person living alone are entitled to the same maximum rate of rent assistance. I would assure the other side of the House that, through this arrangement, no-one will be worse off in the sense that there could be people who, under the new arrangement, could well still be $30 per fortnight better off than a couple receiving rental assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are moving towards more flexibility in terms of the arrangements. We acknowledge also that no two veterans are the same and no two circumstances are the same. That is why these legislative amendments will provide that flexibility for the Repatriation Commission to assess individual rental arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also point out that, by allowing that flexibility, it also acknowledges those veterans who live in rural and remote Australia and who quite often have a different circumstance in relation to accommodation because of the difficulty in obtaining it in some areas. I assure you that in some areas we are acknowledging that by allowing these legislative amendments. I present the supplementary explanatory memorandum.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not my intention to delay the proceedings of the House this afternoon because I realise that we are approaching the adjournment and members want to leave. I wanted to put a couple of things on the record at this stage of the bill. It was H.G. Wells who said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In England we have come to rely upon a comfortable timelag of 50 years or a century intervening between the perception that something ought to be done and a serious attempt to do it.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I am pleased to say that in Australia we are a little swifter, although perhaps we take a little longer than might otherwise be desirable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1987-88 I chaired an inquiry of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training and tabled a report in this House in May 1988 entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Getting to work: report of the inquiry into training or return to the workforce by social security pensioners</EMPHASIS>. In the context of this bill, I would like to read into the record a number of the comments of that committee because they are supportive. A number of other recommendations of that report have been adopted over the years, but here we are now looking at something that was perceived by that inquiry eight years ago to be a significant problem for people on social security attempting to re&hyphen;enter the work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I shall read several extracts from the report. Under the heading `Administrative arrangements', the report said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DSS has principal responsibility for providing information about benefits available, whilst CES is responsible for information about referral to education and training programs. This division of responsibility inhibits effective communication of all relevant information to those who need it.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In the context of attempts that had been made under regional and local committees to bring together the sorts of services that this bill now enshrines under the new agency, the report made this comment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committees could consider establishing shopfront Back to Work Units. Social security recipients could be referred to these Units when their unemployment is likely to be long-term, and when it is envisaged that they will need resources additional to the average unemployment beneficiary.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .       . . .      . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A centralised unit could provide a range of information and could develop an effective data base of educational training and employment opportunities, which is not currently available. Departments tend to specialise in information related primarily to the services provided by that particular Department. In view of the plethora of agencies providing services and assistance, there appears to be a great need for a single centre providing a simple but comprehensive guide to education and training options and support services.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The committee went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Examples of lack of information abound. For instance, in New South Wales Sole Parent phone-in for supporting parents&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" RIGHT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a huge number of the women did not know about Austudy. When we asked people at DSS why they were not telling women whose kids were coming up to that age group that if their kids stayed at school they were entitled to Austudy, they said "we cannot do everything". But this is another government program.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In the end, the committee said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Closer liaison between CES and DSS is essential in ensuring that beneficiaries have access to counselling and/or employment advice even when they are unable to travel to the relevant office.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Throughout the inquiry, that committee received evidence on the obstacles that were put in the way of social security recipients who were trying to gain entry or re-entry into the work force by virtue of the variety of different offices that held information that was needed by the client group. From our visits to some of those offices, it was very much our experience that those agencies which were co&hyphen;located did much better than those which were geographically separated.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1617">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill provides more than a co&hyphen;location; this is a combining of departmental services to effect the expediting of gainful employment by those who want it. As I said, it has not taken 50 years but it has taken nine. I am pleased that the Howard government has addressed this particular recommendation of that inquiry.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Those in the House who have been paying attention to the debate on the Retirement Savings Accounts Bill would know that the opposition is not seeking to oppose this bill. However, we do have several concerns which will be reflected in the amendments we are seeking to move. We trust that our concerns will also be addressed within the parameters of the processes of Senate scrutiny.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I begin my submission by saying that Labor not only allowed banks to enter Australia's growing superannuation market but also oversaw perhaps one of its greatest success stories&mdash;the introduction of compulsory superannuation. The growth of industry schemes, as part of the union arranged superannuation arrangements, has also met with great success. Many workers in the country have reaped significant benefits from union based, industry based funds which have performed very well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That contrasts somewhat with the introduction of retirement savings accounts by the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> coalition, which is being driven, at least in part, by their suspicion and mistrust of the aforementioned industry based superannuation funds&mdash;primarily because of the involvement of trade unions and workers as trustees on the boards of these funds&mdash;and by the fact that they need to pay back the banks all those generous donations they made to the coalition prior to the last election. Of course, it is well known to us on this side that the ANZ was the largest net donor to the coalition of any corporation in the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also the contention of the opposition that, given those on the other side constantly cry for the need to foster and promote competition, the government should let superannuation funds offer RSAs as well. Under the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act, equal representation on the board of trustees of superannuation funds of both employers and employees is guaranteed&mdash;that is to say, there is equal representational numbers of each party, and, quite rightly, a two-thirds majority of the board is required before any decision is taken and acted upon. This structure obviously ensures that the interests of everyone, both parties, are addressed and guaranteed. This has proved to be a remarkably effective and efficient system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am aware of many industry superannuation funds which could serve as a model for cooperation between employers and, in particular, trade unions at any level. I could cite, for example, my recent conversation with Mr Graham Gathercole, who is the Managing Director of Gathercole's Abattoirs, in the electorate of Isaacs. He is a trustee of the Meat Industry Superannuation Fund. I have also been privileged to be a member of the Labour Union Cooperative Retirement Fund myself. They are two of the best performing funds around. Those two funds are fine examples of the cooperation of union-employer trustee arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the main differences between an RSA and a  traditional superannuation fund is that, unlike superannuation funds, which do have a trustee structure and whose trustees can be charged under the Corporations Act for any misdemeanours they might commit&mdash;because, obviously, they hold money on
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1618"> behalf of their members and are not profit making bodies&mdash;RSAs will have no such trustee structure. Hence, those safeguards have been swept aside and will just disappear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that banks simply see RSAs as a way to lock in long-term capital in a low interest type product. Of course, we all know now that RSAs will be capital guaranteed. But it is vitally important that investors in RSAs understand exactly what it means to be capital guaranteed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, the capital guarantee simply means that the amount invested cannot be reduced due to negative instrument returns or through the imposition of fees. The upshot of this is that with this level of security goes the acknowledgment from both the government and the banks that the rate of return on RSAs will be something around three per cent lower than that for superannuation funds. Indeed, in his submission to the House earlier today, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and shadow Treasurer (Mr Gareth Evans) cited Australian Consumers Association evidence of that three per cent figure. It is due to this low rate of return that there has been a push to set a maximum limit on RSAs of around $10,000, at which point investors would need to replace any further funds in a traditional account to attract higher returns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the capital guarantee does not mean that, in the case of a bank collapsing or facing some form of liquidity difficulties, investors may be safeguarded. The low return rates of RSAs are a concern not just to individual investors but because of the effect that they will have on the national saving pool and on a retiree's ability to provide for themselves in their retirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One turns to the elderly when one thinks of the fact that the banks no doubt, with the government's compliance, will be marketing RSAs at retirees and the elderly, given that retirees are looking at some form of safe place in which to invest their money with low risk. But what is not being marketed or what I do not foresee will be marketed to these retirees is the fact that these RSAs will also have low rates of return. In fact, retirees and the elderly could quite alternatively and simply deposit their money into other capital
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> guaranteed funds which are similarly of low risk but which offer higher rates of return.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have cited the fact that the Australian Consumers Association has taken an interest in this area and has provided us with a further glaring example of the differences in performances between outcomes of RSAs and superannuation funds. In fact, the association compared three people&mdash;an example cited by the member for Holt&mdash;who have $10,000 to invest. One person leaves it in an RSA for the rest of their working life, attracts a real interest rate of one per cent and comes out at the end with a lump sum of around $164,000. The second person leaves his or her investment in a superannuation fund, earns a real return of some four per cent and gets a pay-out of $225,000. The third person gets a return of perhaps 6.5 per cent from their superannuation fund and ends up with $390,000. So, as you can see, there is a massive difference in their performances, one which will no doubt have a potentially significant impact on both national savings and the government's social security commitments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It must be drawn to the attention of potential investors again that, while these RSAs might be low cost, while they might be low risk, they are of low rate of return. That needs to be spelt out by the federal government and the banks. Choice is a great thing, but people must be given and afforded the opportunity of digesting all the relevant information before they are able to make what is hopefully an informed choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has been very keen to have the whole arena of superannuation withdrawn from industrial awards, which generally prescribe which industry superannuation fund employees and employers will contribute to. The government has argued that this limits choice and, hence, competition amongst suppliers of superannuation and related product instruments. No doubt we will see further efforts and further examples to have the Workplace Relations Act amended to exclude similar superannuation provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One interesting advantage that the current proposed RSA system does have is that it does require far less time and effort administratively from employers than would a system
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1619"> which would see every employee having a different superannuation fund or RSA. Given the fact that the government has indeed made great play of reducing the amount of red tape on business, this is a point that they seem to have conveniently overlooked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How much choice there will be in reality, unless RSAs are functioning properly, is anyone's guess. How much choice there will be, unless the advantages and disadvantages of the system are fully explained, is again anyone's guess. These things need to be properly explained by the banks and by those offering RSAs. The government has not given any indication that it has thought through this task.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">RSA providers are not required to disclose information to employees before an RSA account is opened. What should be the employee's choice? Should they open an account? If so, with whom? These are the sorts of choices that ought to be made by the person whose money is being deposited and they ought to be made with the benefit of being afforded all proper information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How much choice will there really be in the workplace when a boss says to their new employee that he or she would prefer them to take out an RSA with a given bank? The choice may be to take an RSA with a particular bank or perhaps forgo their job&mdash;an unlikely example perhaps but far from impossible. Even a 14&hyphen;day cooling-off period, as proposed under the legislation, in my view, would do little to address this potentially problematic scenario.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have said before on more than one occasion that RSAs are of low growth and a low return product. Something that really has never been acknowledged by the Treasurer is the fact that they are a low return product. Employees must understand the long-term cost of remaining within a retirement savings account as opposed to remaining in the long haul with a managed superannuation fund. I cite again that, according to data recently published by the Australian Consumers Association, rates of return average something around three per cent below those of managed superannuation funds, and it is indeed essen
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tial that prospective consumers of this superannuation instrument comprehend this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, if the government really does believe in choice and competition, why will it not allow superannuation funds to operate RSAs? I contend that it is because the government has a fundamental loathing of superannuation funds which have union involvement. Or perhaps it is because this might result in a little bit too much competition for the banks. I have no doubt that the Wallis inquiry will recommend further mergers of banks, or at least not oppose further mergers of banks. Again, one wonders what the government's position would be on that particular matter, given that it would serve to decrease levels of competition&mdash;something that I would have thought the government was trying to foster.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another important distinction between RSAs and superannuation funds is that many funds are in the practice of offering death and disability insurance as part of their overall benefit package. For many low income earning Australians, this is a service they would not otherwise be able to avail themselves of. RSAs are unlikely to offer such services or, indeed, if they did, it would be at prohibitive cost. For low income earners, RSAs do not offer the same type of superannuation cover as do superannuation funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the government will also argue that the introduction of RSAs will solve the problems associated with small accounts. These accounts have in the past been heavily eaten into by administrative fees and charges, often resulting in negative returns. However, the introduction in 1995 of the Small Superannuation Accounts Act, which provides the Australian Taxation Office the opportunity to operate small accounts in such a way as to ensure that both fees and charges do not exceed earnings, has done much to address this problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To conclude, I outline the concerns of the opposition. There is no trustee structure within the RSA arrangements. The possibilities of informed choice are diminished concomitantly with a possible rise in coercion in terms of which fund an employee is directed at by his or her employer. As I have said before in my submission, we are also con
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1620"> cerned about the low rates of return, and that bogie of the government, the ACTU, of course, shares these concerns but would support the amendments the opposition is seeking to make. The opposition is to vote in support of these bills but will be looking to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation to investigate these possible amendments.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DK6">Mr HOCKEY</NAME><ELECTORATE> (North Sydney)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(5.19 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Over the past five to 10 years there has been much discussion of the so-called greying of Australia. In 1901, only four per cent of the population of Australia was 65 or over. By 1961, the proportion of the population aged over 65 had more than doubled to 8.5 per cent. Today it is estimated to be approximately 13 per cent. In my electorate of North Sydney, according to the 1991 census, the proportion of the population aged 65 or more was slightly greater than the national average.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is anticipated that the ageing of the Australian population will continue, experiencing marked growth at the turn of the century and particularly after 2011. By 2030, close to 20 per cent of the Australian population will be 65 or over. By 2051, it will be one-third.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While our ageing trend appears dramatic, it has not proceeded to the same degree as many other industrialised countries, particularly those in northern Europe. For example, in 1985 Norway and Sweden already had a greater proportion of persons over 65 than Australia expects to reach at the turn of the century. This is due in large part to the fact that Australia has sustained fairly high levels of immigration since World War II. The population ageing which has characterised Australia's demographic outlook is in part due to increased longevity; however, it is more significantly due to the fact that the baby boom was followed by a dramatic decline in the birth rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Coinciding with this increase in the population of older Australians is the tendency for the age of retirement to actually decrease. In the 30-year period between 1966 and 1996, the labour force participation of people aged 55 and older fell from 33 per cent to 22 per cent. The trend towards earlier retirement,
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> coupled with increased life expectancy, has prompted some to refer to retirement as a separate or third age, one almost as long as the working or second age. Indeed, today the period of economic dependency on the age pension or one's own savings, as the case may be, is often lengthy; 20 to 30 years is not uncommon for those retiring at the age of 55.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note that the concept of retirement of any sort is a 20th century concept. The concept of a lengthy period of retirement is very modern. Prior to the Industrial Revolution, most individuals simply worked until they were physically unable to do so, at which time their families became the providers of support and care. Most people were self&hyphen;employed in agriculture or small businesses. Furthermore, far fewer people lived to an advanced age.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian age pension can trace its origins to the early years of this century and, in large part, is a result of the depression of the 1890s. Australia, despite its youth, was well ahead of the United States and Canada in this regard as the US did not introduce such a system until the 1930s and Canada did not introduce it until the 1920s. The institution of retirement gradually evolved through this century, but it was not until the mid&hyphen;1970s that Australia experienced rapid rates of retirement. Coincidentally, this came at the same time as the end of full employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia's demographic outlook and the trend towards early retirement require government policies that facilitate the way in which people can make greater provision for their retirement during their working lives. Recognising that superannuation policy is central to coping with an ageing population and is an important vehicle for national savings, this government has undertaken a number of important and significant initiatives to make superannuation a fairer and more flexible retirement system for all Australians. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Specifically, firstly, the government is meeting its election commitment to introduce a rebate of 18 per cent from 1 July 1997 for individuals who make contributions on behalf of spouses with low incomes. Secondly, the government will increase the general age limit for superannuation contributions from 65 to 70. Third
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1621"> ly, the government will allow employees with incomes between $450 and $900 a month to choose between superannuation guarantee contributions or the equivalent as wages or salary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those families running a small business, the government is introducing its promised capital gains exemption on the sale of small businesses where the proceeds are used for retirement purposes. This exemption will operate in a manner consistent with the announcement in the budget to provide capital gains tax rollover relief for small businesses. Finally, the government intends to allow banks, building societies, credit unions and life insurance companies to provide superannuation without a trust structure in the form of retirement savings accounts, also known as RSAs, through the implementation of the Retirement Savings Account Bill 1996, which is what we are discussing today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Retirement savings accounts are a simple, low cost, low risk investment product especially suited to those with small amounts of superannuation, such as itinerant or casual workers, those wishing to amalgamate small amounts of superannuation and those nearing retirement who may wish to minimise risk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill forms part of a package of three bills that serve to implement the government's 1996 budget decision regarding retirement savings accounts&mdash;the RSAs. The government believes that retirement savings accounts play an important role in increasing choice in superannuation by giving employees greater scope to control the investment of their superannuation savings. Retirement savings accounts also play an important role in increasing competition by, firstly, raising the standard of service in the delivery in the superannuation industry; secondly, encouraging greater product innovation and diversity; and, thirdly, placing downward pressure on fees and charges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Existing legislation requires a trustee structure as a condition to receiving concessional tax treatment. This bill, however, allows specified prudentially supervised institutions&mdash;that is, banks, building societies, credit unions and life insurance companies&mdash;to provide superannuation in the form of RSAs
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> without a trust structure from 1 July 1997. Through the government's RSA reforms, these institutions will be able to provide superannuation directly off their balance sheet, facilitating more cost&hyphen;efficient delivery of superannuation without compromising the security of member benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, it is not the intent of the government that RSAs replace existing superannuation funds. Rather, it is intended that the availability of RSAs will expand the range of options for consumers. The provision of retirement savings accounts will benefit employees who have broken work patterns, as RSAs will offer a flexible product to accommodate small and irregular contributions. RSAs will benefit the approximately two million Australians, or around 22 per cent of the total work force, who are involved in part&hyphen;time employment, many of whom work with a number of different employers. RSAs will benefit the approximately 15,000 North Sydney citizens who are employed on a part&hyphen;time basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">RSAs will be of particular benefit to women who stop work or work on a part&hyphen;time or part&hyphen;year basis to have children and contribute to the raising of a family. Approximately one&hyphen;third of working women in North Sydney are employed on a part&hyphen;time basis. Part&hyphen;time or casual workers often have a number of superannuation accounts with small balances that they make little or no effort to trace. The government believes that the retirement savings accounts may offer an attractive solution to this problem. I am very mindful of the time allowed for the debate. So I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The debate about the future of the auto industry which is going on in the Australian community and in this House today is very much a debate about regional economies and regional jobs. Yes, it is an issue to states such as South Australia, Victoria, Queensland and New South Wales. But, perhaps more importantly, it is an even more important issue in regions such as Ballarat, Bendigo and Geelong and places such as Taree, Nowra, Albury and Orange, just to name a few. It is for that reason that I suggest to the House that the auto industry and the auto components industry play a significant role in building healthy regional economies and building good jobs&mdash;real jobs&mdash;in regional Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last week the shadow ministry visited Ballarat. The shadow minister for industry and regional development, Mr Crean, and I also visited Bendigo. During the course of those visits we had cause to sit down and meet with the local communities&mdash;their mayors, their councillors, the editors of local papers, business leaders, community leaders, teachers, young people and union people. Their message was simple. From the point of view of the auto industry, it was about the need for a sense of security and the question of jobs, concern about the important role that the auto component industries play in their local towns, the prosperity they create and the need to ensure that, once and for all, the debate about the future of their industry is settled. Take the town of Ballarat, for example, where there are 1,500 jobs directly related to this industry. Similarly in Bendigo. Empire Rubber has today announced, in association with the announcement by the Labor Party yesterday going to the question of tariffs, further investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also called upon the coalition government to ensure that they adopt a bipartisan stance with respect to the Labor Party's announcements on industry policy and the future of the automotive industry. It effectively means that
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> both political parties&mdash;all politicians&mdash;stand side by side on the need to ensure that this industry survives into the future. It is for that reason that the Labor Party has brought forward a proposition that tariffs in the automotive industry remain at 15 per cent until 2005.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem is unfortunately that, while the auto components industry is so important to both Bendigo and Ballarat, neither of the local coalition Mps&mdash;the member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) and the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid)&mdash;has yet spoken out on this issue in this parliament. Both  members should adopt, I suggest, a bipartisan stance on this issue. They should fight for the retention of a reasonable industry policy, and embrace the Labor Party's position as enunciated by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) yesterday. Mr Ronaldson and Mr Reid, I suggest to the House, should not be meek. Like some of their coalition colleagues from South Australia, they should stand their ground and ensure that local jobs in their local regions are protected. They should tell the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) that they too are opposed to the cut in tariffs, that they too support an auto industry tariff at 15 per cent until at least the year 2005.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was disappointed to notice that, since the coalition was elected in March last year, neither the member for Bendigo nor the member for Ballarat has spoken out in parliament on this important issue, even though this industry is important for both job creation and the sense of security of the people of Ballarat and Bendigo. Take Ballarat: unemployment has reached 8.3 per cent. Take Bendigo: unemployment is at 10.5 per cent. Take Victoria: 30,000 jobs are directly related to the future of the auto and the auto components industries. I would have thought that the representatives of the federal seats of Ballarat and Bendigo would have thought that the issue was so serious that they would have raised the issue in this parliament since being returned at the election held just on 12 months ago. But it seems that it is not important to either Mr Reid or Mr Ronaldson.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have got to understand that it extends even beyond Ballarat and Bendigo; it is an
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1623"> issue of the utmost importance to the state of Victoria. It affects places such as Altona, Bentleigh East, Brighton, Clayton, Dandenong, Epping, Fairfield, Oakleigh, Preston, Richmond, Reservoir and Thomastown, to name a few towns in Victoria. In my own electorate of Batman it affects 1,200 jobs. I ask the coalition to seriously consider putting aside petty politics and to face up to the question of securing the future of this industry. If it is good enough for the Leader of the Opposition in Victoria and the Premier to stand together on the future of the industry in Victoria, then it is good enough for the representatives of Ballarat and Bendigo to face up to their electoral responsibilities, and the question of job security which was seriously embraced in the Labor Party's announcement on industry policy in the automotive industry in Victoria. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="1623"><TITLE>Shoalcare Elders Program</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak with pride and enthusiasm on yet another initiative of the Gilmore electorate and the Shoalhaven community in particular. Like many electorates in rural and regional Australia, Gilmore suffers from high youth unemployment&mdash;in excess of 30 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since this government took office some 12 months ago, many initiatives have been instigated to assist young people to get work. I would like to introduce members to a new and exciting program being developed in my electorate that I am sure could be considered as the embryo of a major youth program across Australia: a Shoalhaven youth support organisation called Shoalcare&mdash;which manages a number of youth services, including the Shoalhaven Youth Refuge, the aunties and uncles program and a non&hyphen;funded residential hostel and time&hyphen;out house&mdash;has developed a program called `bring back the elders', which is sponsored by Rotary International.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bring back the elders program is just that. It is unashamedly turning the clock back to when the more mature, experienced and motivated members of the tribe led, taught and encouraged their young to develop the skills, attitudes and momentum to contribute to the tribe's wellbeing. We may not live in tribes any more, but we do have many who
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> could be described as modern day elders. They occur in every sphere, stratum and job within society. They may be acknowledged by virtue of their position or their fame or known only to the one person whose life they have positively altered. It is these life winners that the program uses to help our youth climb out of the mind numbing welfare dependency to which we have condemned many of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The program is about us, the community, retrieving the responsibility we delegated by our neglect to government, to schools and to the streets. The bring back the elders program is designed to assist our elders contribute in a positive way to the lives of the youth in our society. It is designed to put back hope into the lives of our kids and to put meaning into the lives of the elders who do care. The program is not welfare&mdash;it is the opposite. It is about giving youth a hand when they want to do better and are wiling to make every effort to try. It is a process of supporting with understanding, helping with knowledge, educating with experience, leading by example and living with respect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This process has worked for 200,000 years. It is only recently that we have delegated the responsibility for our youth to people who, although they may be well versed in theory, have yet to develop the essential qualities that are so important in being an elder. The understanding of wider community issues, life's pitfalls and benefits, leadership skills and the respect of others are not subjects learnt from a book or at a university; they are learnt by ordinary people as they live productive and fulfilling lives. It is a fact that in our modern society the experience gained by our older population is lost to the youth of today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bring back the elders program is designed to utilise that wasted experience by providing the older people in our community with the opportunity to pass on their knowledge to  receptive youth. The program works by attracting older, experienced, caring people who are willing to assist in projects created by and for our youth with enthusiastic encouragement, practical demonstrations, intellectual research and just by being someone to learn from. These projects will be developed with the assistance of service clubs and community
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1624"> groups under the guidance of program managers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The program works by the provision of training sites, development programs, seminars, access business networks, literacy and numeracy development and conferences. It is led by a panel of elders. The coordination of the program is by Shoalcare, with the support of service clubs and sponsorship by the private sector and the media.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It must be remembered that to gain the assistance of these older people, it is vital that the programs they become involved with are seen to be having a positive outcome for the youth. The elders are not going to put a great deal of effort and time into what they perceive to be a lost cause. Each project and activity which develops under the program must contain strategies to ensure that each participating youth grows and can clearly be seen to have gained something through the program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To sum up, the essence of the program is for every child in Australia to be given the opportunity to work in an environment that builds self-esteem for themselves and respect for their elders. There is no reason why the government, the private sector and the community should not support programs like the bring back the elders program, which has the potential to significantly reduce unemployment in regional and rural Australia, particularly in the Shoalhaven.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this place for the second time this week to draw the attention of the House to the quality and calibre of people who live in the suburb of Carrum Downs in my electorate of Isaacs. Earlier this week I drew the attention of the House to the plight faced by residents of the GK Tucker Settlement run by the Brotherhood of St Laurence within Carrum Downs and the problems that they face with regard to potential nursing home charges.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On this occasion I rise again to put to the House the need for a post office in Carrum
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Downs. Residents of this fast growing area were thrilled when a major shopping complex was opened in November 1994. For the first time it meant that residents of the Downs, as it is affectionately known, could have access to a range of shops that they had never before had access to, including a National Australia Bank and a Rainbow supermarket.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the centre did need to really crank up business in the area and to attract other potential traders and shop owners to the complex was a post office to serve the 14,000 residents of Carrum Downs, given that the nearest post office is some four kilometres away in Lathams Road in the nearby suburb of Seaford.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Carrum Downs has a large population, which perhaps forms a cross-section of the Australian community, comprising young families, sole parents and many older residents, including some who live at the GK Tucker Settlement. They often have to struggle long distances to get to the aforementioned post office in Lathams Road, Seaford. Many of those people were signatories to a petition, which circulated with my support throughout Carrum Downs when, as the then candidate for Isaacs, I was pushing Australia Post to agree with centre management to the establishment of a post office at the Hall Road shopping centre. I have been in regular contact with shopping centre management since that time, in particular, Ms Christine Grayland, who has had many discussions with Australia Post since she wrote to them in December 1994. They responded in that same month, suggesting that a post office was unlikely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to say that following regular intervention of people like myself and senior members of the Carrum Downs community, it would appear that a monetary offer has now been submitted by Australia Post to centre management. Negotiations will now proceed between the parties for the establishment of a post office. Without seeking to intervene in any way in what are clearly private negotiations between the parties, I certainly urge the parties to come to a reasonable arrangement and financial settlement as quickly as possible, given that Carrum Downs residents
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1625"> have not been afforded the opportunity of access to a post office now since many of them moved to the Carrum Downs area up to 15 and more years ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that the establishment of a post office will delight shop owners, no more so than newsagent, Mr Trevor Waterfall, who was one of the catalysts for generating the aforementioned petition which was signed by 5,000 local residents. I again implore the parties to reach an expeditious and equitable settlement which will ensure that all residents of this rapid growth area are rightly serviced by a proper Australia Post retail outlet.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="1625"><TITLE>Unemployment</TITLE>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been a little distracted from what I had originally wished to raise in tonight's adjournment debate. It is a serious matter, and I am very pleased to see that the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) is in the House. He was the deputy leader, a very cooperative deputy leader, of a parliamentary delegation to Thailand and Singapore in late 1995. He will recall that we visited camps on the Thai-Burmese border of displaced people of the Karen ethnic group who had come across the border because of the difficulties in the hills and lands that they lived in in Burma.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was very saddened to read several reports in the media in the last couple of weeks about increased activity which has driven an additional 20,000 Karen refugees across the border into Thailand. What was even more distressing was a report from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 17 February which stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the nights of January 28 and 29, DKBA&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">which is the Democratic Karen Buddhist Army&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">forces torched three camps inside Thai territory, leaving at least 4500 refugees homeless, one child and a Thai merchant dead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the border town of Mae Sot, 480km north-west of Bangkok, near the 6830&hyphen;strong Huay Kalok refugee camp which the DKBA partially destroyed, fears are growing of further attacks.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I believe that this Huay Kalok camp, regrettably, is the camp that the delegation visited.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1627"> When you have had the personal contact that the honourable member for Corangamite and I have had with these people, who are basically a peaceful people who would like to be able to return to their land in Burma and to live peacefully, these reports are very distressing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that when the Thai foreign minister was here over the last couple of days he and the Australian government agreed that there is a need, to achieve an effective outcome in Burma, to enter into proper dialogue and proper ventures with the Burmese government. Indeed, the delegation, when looking at the border region, were taken to a Thai-Burmese friendship bridge that was being put in to facilitate trade across the border. That led us to understand the difficult position that the Thai government are in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We acknowledge the work the Thai government are doing with the Karen people. We know the difficulties they have in the use of their security forces to be able to protect people that are in these camps. But I hope that they will continue to try to do the right thing by the Karen people. I hope the international community&mdash;including Australia, which has provided aid to the camps&mdash;will continue to do this through the Burmese border consortium and the funding of such organisations as Medecins sans Frontieres. This is very important. It is very distressing when you see people being driven from their lands are in such danger. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="1627"><TITLE>Immunisation</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise this evening to congratulate the federal Minister for Health and Family Services, the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), on his seven&hyphen;point immunisation initiative, which he announced in this place earlier in the week. It was equally encouraging to hear the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) support the measures and I am delighted by this bipartisan support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that there is no more important issue than our children's health. As a nation, we are fortunate to have the technology to protect our children against preventable
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> diseases. Indeed, we should be doing everything in our power to use this to its optimum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Around 98 per cent of Australian parents support immunisation of their children. However, this is not translating into action. Statistics show that Australia has appalling levels of immunisation. It is no less than a national disgrace that the immunisation rate is approximately 53 per cent. The immunise Australia program aims to have 90 per cent of children up to two years of age fully immunised, and after that we envisage near universal coverage for children up to the age of six.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember well the day I took my two young sons to be immunised. Those were the days when children could not attend kindergarten nor school without confirmation that they had been immunised. However, anecdotal and actual evidence suggests that over the last eight to 10 years this is no longer the case. It is indeed difficult to believe that in a country like Australia we have children dying from preventable diseases. As a nurse, I found it was rare to come across children with diseases such as diphtheria, polio and rubella. It was thought that these were things of the past. So it seems a sad irony that some years down the track these diseases have come back to haunt us through our own complacency and inaction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Parents who do not fully immunise their children not only put their own children at risk but also put other children in serious danger of contracting a preventable disease. The four children who died of whooping cough in New South Wales last year caught this disease from some older children who had not been immunised. It is indeed a tragedy that these deaths occurred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much has been written in the press over the past few months about Australia's low level of immunisation. Because of its importance, I recently conducted a survey in my electorate of Canning asking people their views on immunisation. The survey was timed to coincide with the beginning of the school year and showed that many parents were concerned that their children were at risk of contracting preventable diseases. Ninety-seven per cent of those parents who answered the survey favoured immunisation for their children, and
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1628"> I am positive that they will welcome the measures announced by the government to boost immunisation levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As many commentators have noted this week, the government will be using a range of carrots and sticks to guarantee that the levels are increased. These measures have been fully outlined by the minister for health in his ministerial statement on Tuesday and I do not intend to go into details here today. Suffice it to say that I commend the incentive to restructure the maternity allowance for parents so as to provide a bonus for ensuring that their child's immunisation coverage is complete.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this week's edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> there was a letter from Mr Peter Doherty from the St Jude Children's Research Hospital in the United States. This letter was obviously written before the minister's announcement. However, I thought it worth while to mention part of what Mr Doherty had to say. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It may be hard to deal with a child crying following a vaccination. It is infinitely more difficult to live with the knowledge that your child has died, or is debilitated in the long term, as a consequence of completely preventable infection. Legislation is clearly needed to ensure all Australian children are immunised.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The honourable member for Chisholm has stated that he has no intention of going down in history as a health minister who sat idle on his hands while Australian children died of vaccine preventable illnesses.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last night, before the adjournment of the Main Committee, I commenced my remarks on the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency Bill 1996 by reiterating my concerns about certain aspects of the service delivery agency. One of those concerns that I indicated last night was location and how many agencies it was proposed there would be. I also expressed my concern about what I believe to be a developing theme within this government that certain measures it is taking are not based on what appears to be a transparent basis of need.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An article in this morning's Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald&hyphen;Sun</EMPHASIS> showed that there was an apparent lack of justice in the way in which resources are being allocated, and that is another cause for concern. Under the headline `Apprentice shops in jobs strategy', there is an announcement of a one&hyphen;stop apprenticeship shop and the announcement that there have been 18 pilot programs announced nationally. Of those 18, there are four in Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the difficulties I have in making comment at this early stage about this announcement is that whist this article appears to indicate that this is `a new weapon to attack rural unemployment', the four centres in Victoria where these shops are going to be opened are: Ballarat, Bendigo and Wangaratta&mdash;and I have no argument about the classification of those three cities as being rural&mdash;and the fourth is to be opened in Ringwood. Ringwood is very much part of metropolitan Melbourne.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason I have disquiet is that the region the electorate of Scullin is in in Melbourne has the highest unemployment rate of all regions in Victoria and has an unemployment rate that is not declining. It makes me wonder why, on the basis of need, yet again, in another new program, which one assumes the government thinks is worthwhile, the region I represent is missing out. This adds to the schools pathways program that the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) announced earlier this month and adds to other concerns about the way in which some of the new programs the government is proposing are being put in place.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1632">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another aspect I have concern about is that there has been no discussion about how the agency will ensure quality of service. For over 50 years, for instance, the CES has fulfilled, as I said last night, an essential public function in providing assistance to everyone. But, regrettably, right of assistance will be a thing of the past under the Howard government. With employment services now, people are to be screened as to their capacity to benefit. The documentation that has been released thus far contains only the most rudimentary details of this job seeker classification instrument. The questions that need to be posed are: what weighting will be given to variables? What regional variations will be included? What mechanisms for appeal will there be? What mechanisms&mdash;and this is very important for the electorate of Scullin&mdash;are there to ensure that people with English language difficulties are properly assessed? At the moment, at best, the answers to these questions are vague and sketchy. In some cases those questions are yet to be answered. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another great concern about the way in which the proposed service delivery agency has been developed so far is the way in which DEETYA and social security staff are being left in the dark about how the agency will really impact. This piece of legislation, in part, goes to certain aspects and also indicates that, after the agency is up and running, a lot of these things will be left in the hands of the board and the CEO. This is a cause for grave concern. The people who work in DSS and DEETYA regional offices are very important players in the way in which the Commonwealth government projects itself in local and regional areas. It is of great concern that they are being asked to make very important decisions about their futures without really getting adequate information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another aspect of this agency that I expressed concern about back in September was that the way in which the government is setting up the agency&mdash;that is, the types of services it will provide and the nature of the agency&mdash;poses the question of whether that will lead to privatisation. I do not make that sort of suggestion lightly. If one looks at governments, especially state governments around Australia&mdash;and more particularly the Victorian government&mdash;that has been the tendency. Max Moore&hyphen;Wilton has made statements to the effect that changes to the Public Service will develop a greater definition of policy aspects of the Public Service as against service delivery, which really does indicate that by separating and making them distinct it sets them up as being able to offload or outsource many of the aspects of the Public Service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am told that even in Victoria, where this argument has really revolved around service delivery, there is some suggestion that the Kennett government might go down the path of outsourcing policy development. I find the notion that in public administration a government would even devolve itself of direct responsibility for the development of policy very strange.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Something that has been mentioned by other members on this side of the House during this debate about the agency is their concern that the agency&mdash;by the very nature of the way it is being set up&mdash;is set at a further arm's length away from proper parliamentary scrutiny. Any stage at which this is done is a grave cause for concern. Those aspects of the way in which the agency is being put in place should be revisited and reviewed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been suggested that there is the potential for the agency, some time down the track, to be put out to tender or put out to competition. In other jurisdictions, especially in local government in Victoria where compulsory competitive tendering has been enforced by the state government, the workers in local government have been given the opportunity to make in&hyphen;house bids. In some of the examples of outsourcing and tendering within the Commonwealth Public Service, that same sort of opportunity has not been given to workers.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1633">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was a bit dismayed at the response of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) to a dorothy dixer about the contract for the outsourcing of the information technology activities of the Department of Veterans' Affairs, where a fair opportunity was not given to those people working within the department to make an in-house bid. They were really denied adequate support to address things that were outlined in the contract requirements&mdash;such as the purchasing of equipment&mdash;to be able to make a proper bid. Indeed, if the Commonwealth government is going to further develop its attempts to outsource and privatise very important aspects of public administration, in fairness to those who work within the Public Service, and indeed, to ensure that the tendering process is as transparent as it can be, I believe that the workers within those areas to be put to tender should be given a fair and very real opportunity to place a competitive bid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs made great claims about the savings that were going to be achieved by this particular contract to ISSC Ballarat, Victoria, and made other extraneous comments that, in some way, critics and the union were against providing regional job opportunities and things like that. That was not the issue. The journal <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Technology Transactions</EMPHASIS> comments about these perceived savings. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The $65 million contract, therefore, superficially appears to be in line&hyphen;ball with present costs, rather than saving $20 million, as is claimed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The journal was mentioning the information technology expenditure of $21 million within the Department of Veterans' Affairs in 1996. Perhaps even this suggested saving is illusory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I declare an interest of sorts in the Department of Veterans' Affairs activity, having worked for 13 years for the department. At that time, the people who developed the information technology systems in veterans' affairs were leaders throughout the Public Service. The system not only had responsibility for pension payments and monitoring of entitlements but also catered for hospitals throughout the Commonwealth which the department then administered. This system was able to cater for all those things and was well and truly a leader within the Public Service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shadow minister led the debate on this legislation and indicated, along with a number of my colleagues, that the opposition sees merit in the notion of bringing together the services of the CES and the Department of Social Security. Although the opposition sees a potential for efficiencies, we cannot understand the requirement to set up the agency in the manner which is suggested by this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When this type of quasi&hyphen;corporatisation of a new agency does occur, it leads to a great fear in the minds of many about what can happen down the track to that corporatised entity. Throughout my years as a government backbencher, the previous Labor government caused me similar concerns in regard to the corporatisation of a number of entities. So I come before the Main Committee as being consistent and having learnt, rather regrettably on some occasions, that it can be the toe in the door to full privatisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At some stage down the track, I hope the ministers responsible can give greater reassurance to those who have taken an interest in the development of the agency, those who will be clients and, most importantly, those people who work for the authorities whose functions the agency will subsume, to give them cause for confidence about what their futures might be. I hope they can also give cause to make people feel comfortable that this is not the first step of many that would see a number of the activities of Commonwealth administration outsourced and privatised&mdash;given to bidders whose profit motive would lead to some concern about the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1634"> efficiency of the delivery of what are very important services to clients targeted by the agencies which the service delivery agency will replace.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This particular bill, the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency Bill 1996&mdash;and the creation of the agency per se&mdash;covers an enormous area of government service responsibility. Many speakers have already touched on the creation of the agency with a variety of concerns. One particular area of huge government responsibility that is now going to be contained within this new agency is a very big concern to me, and that is the delivery of employment services. It is that area of the agency that I would most like to concentrate on today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amongst other things, this bill is about the beginning or, should I say, almost the conclusion of the privatisation of employment services. Employment and unemployment is of particular concern in our community today. It touches almost every family in my electorate in one way or another. We need to consider very carefully and very seriously the implications of changing dramatically the delivery of those employment services to our community and, with the inception of the agency, we are going to have a huge number of questions to consider very carefully.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I happen to represent an electorate in the ACT where we, unfortunately, now see consistent unemployment&mdash;particularly youth unemployment&mdash;swinging between some 30 and 50 per cent. That has been held at a level over recent months. If we couple the moves in the service provision for employment services with the disappearance of employment training programs&mdash;actions that I believe are entrenching the long&hyphen;term unemployed into long&hyphen;term unemployment&mdash;and a lack of assistance for those with additional difficulties in obtaining employment, these things are all going to lead to a pretty hopeless situation for a number of those people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that the CES, through this agency, is going to be replaced by a PEPE, which is a public employment placement enterprise, and the privately run EPE, which is an employment placement enterprise. In my electorate, I have already seen the rationalisation of the CES case management structure with the relocation of those case managers to an area outside my electorate. That is of concern to me even before the agency comes in. I understand that eventually all of these PEPE services will probably be centralised in the city in Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Previous speakers on this bill have talked about remote rural areas and more remote urban areas. My responsibility is to look after the people in my area and my electorate and I am concerned that, in the current economic climate in Canberra, we are going to see unemployed people isolated even more from the services that I believe they are going to need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The four CES case managers in my area were handling up to 500 clients. That is an indication of the level of need that a number of people in the community suffering from unemployment and long&hyphen;term unemployment really require. We must understand that those people who need the services of a case manager are folk who have one or other difficulties in finding employment. The success rate of the system of case management was proving rewarding, to say the least, and I really think we need to carefully consider the sorts of difficulties that these people undergo when we decide to consider dramatic changes to employment services.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The previous speaker already mentioned some of these people. They are people who have English as a second language, people who are attempting to re&hyphen;enter the work force after a period of being outside it and people with a disability of one form or another, or one degree or another, who really need some additional assistance.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1635">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the agency comes into place and the EPEs or PEPEs are located where they will be, my strong suspicion and my understanding from speaking to people in my electorate is that they will probably all have to travel to the city. In some cases from my electorate that is 30 to 40 kilometres for some of them. I want to know whether they will get extra travel assistance to do that or whether they will have to rely solely on the sort of income they unfortunately have to survive on to get around. I also understand that the PEPE will not be established in Tuggeranong, which is the major town centre area in my electorate. Since the inception of this government, and unfortunately with the assistance of the local ACT government, the employment base in my electorate is really shrinking. The suspicion is that the EPEs will probably not locate there either, for the simple reason that it will not be marketable for them to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where does this leave the clients who are actively seeking employment opportunities in my area? When they eventually find their way to the PEPE, what will confront them under this new agency proposal? I understand that we have already started to move down the track of having touch screens for people to use when they walk into a CES. I find that pretty inhuman. I have spoken to some people who have gone into the local CES, which still exists in my electorate, walked up to a touch screen, pushed a few buttons, found that there is no work in their area and walked out the door. I do not find that terribly constructive in terms of counselling or assisting these people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also understand that, with the surge in technology, Internet connections will be possible. I think that is fantastic. I am not at all against the utilisation of information technology. That is all very well, as long as people have access to the Internet. My major concern is that, first of all, you either have the access and you can use it, or you do not, and you have to go to a centre where it is available. Will the PEPE or EPE have the Internet available and will that be a replacement for human contact? If that is the case, how do we counsel ourselves in dealing with the implications that may have for some of clients I have already described?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even more importantly, currently you can go to your local CES and seek referrals to available jobs. An example could be a motor mechanic who is current unemployed. Theoretically, he could go into a CES now and, with any luck, receive in that one place referrals to maybe two, three or more jobs. When an EPE is established, under that proposal as I understand it, what will happen is that he will go to EPE number one and he may get a referral for a motor mechanic's position. He can go to EPE number two which will be in a completely different physical location and possibly find another job referral. Then he could possibly go to EPE number three. What I am really getting at here is that, instead of having a very efficient, economical and proficient system of job referral, it will all be heaped upon these people to track around their respective areas, no matter where it is in Australia, and do all they can to try to find a job referral from a number of sources. I have a great deal of difficulty understanding the efficiency of this and would welcome some explanation from someone at some stage, if I am correct in my assumptions as to how that is going to work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> At the moment, I understand that anyone can wander into their local CES and seek some advice of one sort or another. But under the new system I ask the question: is it true that only benefit recipients will receive that service free? I do not know the answer to that question. I am posing it. Is it true that only benefit recipients will now be able to get those services free if they go into a PEPE, and will others have to pay for these services? I do not know.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1636">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How may this impact, given the removal of the minimum rate of payment for youth training allowance? What will happen with the new common youth allowance? Potentially how many young people will possibly not be eligible for what I would like to term free employment services? As I said, I do not know the answer to these questions, but they are questions being posed to me by people in my electorate and they deservedly require appropriate answers. The important point is that the questions are legitimate and they are of concern. Given an appropriate answer, those queries could be satisfied. However, I would really emphasise that we need to have some good explanation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another question I wanted to ask concerning this agency employment service aspect is: what guarantees will surround the operations of these EPEs, in particular? They are going to be private enterprises. Many of them will emerge from excellent businesses that already exist out there as training and job assistance enterprises. I know some of them and the operators of some of them. They are of exemplary reputation and run very good services. Some of those may, in fact, evolve into becoming an EPE. What will be done to test the bona fides of all people wishing to create an EPE in the future? I would like to pose a couple of important questions in relation to that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that the PEPEs will be accountable, to some extent, to government, whilst the EPE will be pretty much a free agent, even though the PEPE is having to compete commercially with its counterpart. Does this not seem a bit confusing? It seems a bit contradictory to me. I understand that, when an EPE successfully places a client into employment, after a period of 13 weeks of that successful placement the final payment will be made to the EPE agency in relation to that client. That is fine, but what guarantees will there be that no collusion can occur between an EPE and an employer? I am not suggesting for a moment that everybody in this game will be corrupt. I believe that it is the responsibility of the government to make absolutely certain that we do not close the stable door after the horse has bolted. That is a very legitimate question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The defence could be that, if we&mdash;the government or the authorities&mdash;review and monitor and find that something inappropriate has occurred, that particular EPE may not be relicensed. In my view, that is a bit late. I do not know what guarantees there would be to stop people from setting up a business, making a heap of money and not caring if they never get relicensed. I am not predicting that this will happen. Has that been thought about, and what guarantees and conditions are in place to counter it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another important question is raised in the case of a client who is in the `hard to place' category, such as the long&hyphen;term unemployed and the person with difficulties in finding work&mdash;all very legitimate reasons. When people are in that category&mdash;and I believe I am right in saying this&mdash;a part payment will be made to the EPE, which is a sort of kick&hyphen;off payment to begin the process when they take that client on. What guarantees are there that that EPE will remain faithful to that `difficult' client? And, should employment not result, what is going to be accepted as a reasonable period of time and amount of effort for that particular client? Again, this is a very legitimate question. I have not seen anything that answers that query, hence my reason for bringing it up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am extremely concerned that these questions are serious questions and legitimate concerns. Hopefully, satisfactory answers can be found. I would welcome it, because that means that the people I fear for need not have that fear, and I would be the first to tell them. They do not deserve to have any additional concern laid on them. After all, they are people who are
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1637"> seriously and sincerely looking for work. They have a whole heap of problems; they do not need this on top of it. I share the concerns of many in the community about the role of the creation of the agency. They are very legitimate queries and it is my responsibility to bring these to the attention of the authorities in creating this new agency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said at the outset, I have deliberately concentrated on the employment services aspects of the agency, given what I think is the very sad state of the employment and economic picture in my electorate. I do not think that I am Robinson Crusoe. Very many people could stand up in this Main Committee or in the other place and make reference to their concerns for members of their constituencies who are currently finding it very difficult to survive in the employment market. We talk a lot&mdash;as does the government&mdash;about the need to concentrate more on job creation and the employment market. I tend to believe that we are a little bit more sincere and that when we say that we really worry about these people, we really do want to do something to help them. I do not understand how the creation of an agency, with what I consider at this point in time to be a very confusing change in the employment service delivery for our clients in the community, can really be justified at the same time that we are facing disturbing trends in employment and unemployment figures, and disturbing trends in certain areas of economic development around the country. In my electorate in the ACT, the economy is in such a bad state that job prospects are going down, not coming up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I value this opportunity to speak on this bill and bring to the attention of the Main Committee concerns that I believe are very legitimate and real. I welcome the opportunity to hear honest and truthful responses to the queries that I have raised today.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If I may, I will first table the corrigendum to the explanatory memorandum to the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency Bill, which deals with the outlying and financial impact statement, and there is an explanation associated with that. I intend to take up a number of matters that were raised about the bill. I welcome the comments of the member for Namadgi (Ms Ellis), who is the only member remaining&mdash;perhaps that is because she has just concluded her statement. I am sure she will remain for the whole of my contribution in order that I might respond. At the end of my speech I am going to use the opportunity to speak on some of her observations. But she may have to inform her many colleagues who had a contribution to make, who I note are not here, of my response. There is a great deal I want to say about their comments as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the short time available&mdash;perhaps the honourable member will want to move an extension&mdash;I want to refer to the amendment moved by the honourable member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) and say that provisions such as clause 14 of the bill are common in other Commonwealth legislation. The general policies of the government are generally applicable to government operations, and by their very nature are therefore public statements and open to scrutiny and public accountability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second part, relating to the board's unfettered power to set terms and conditions of the chief executive, is factually incorrect. Clause 31 provides for the terms and conditions applicable to the CEO to be determined by the board. However, under clause 13(1) the minister may give directions to the board and in relation to the terms and conditions of the chief executive officer. Particulars of any directions given by the minister under this section in a financial year must be included in the annual report for that agency for that year.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1638">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third matter deals with the erosion of Public Service terms and conditions through the agency's ability to employ staff under terms and conditions different from those specified in the Public Service Act. As stated in the information kit sent by the minister on 17 February to all members and senators, all staff of the Department of Social Security and the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs will transfer to the agency under the Public Service Act and remain under this act. No staff member who transfers will be placed under any pressure to move outside the Australian Public Service conditions of employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The general expectation for the future is that the primary staffing framework for the agency will continue to be under the Public Service Act, and flexibility will be developed to improve customer service, including more personalised service and more extensive opening hours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer to the issues that have been raised in the course of this debate, and there have been many. The honourable member for Batman raised the issue of lack of scrutiny by parliament, and that theme was picked up by some of his colleagues. In my second reading speech, the issue of scrutiny of the agency was raised. The member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) suggested that the agency is a major step away from the Westminster system. The second reading speech makes it clear that the agency will have full public and parliamentary scrutiny. It will be subject to the Audit Act, financial regulations, finance directions and parliamentary committees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the agency is to be established within the Social Security portfolio, it will be accountable to parliament through the Minister for Social Security. The funding of the agency will be determined by the government and reflected in the appropriations through the existing budget process. Annual appropriations will be included in appropriations bills prepared for the budget and will come before parliament for scrutiny and passage and will be subject to the estimates process. These, of course, are matters that are fundamental to the Westminster system. The agency will deliver its services as part of the Commonwealth and not as a separate entity of the Commonwealth. It is not a corporation. It is not corporatisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have already mentioned the terms and conditions for employees. The agency is part of the Commonwealth. As the second reading speech makes clear, it is part of the core of the Commonwealth's operations. Staff who transfer will be under the act and they will stay under the act. They will not be placed under any pressure. I have made these observations before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Batman referred to a $350,000 remuneration package to the CEO. I am told that the salary package is equivalent to that of the mid&hyphen;range departmental secretary, which is approximately half the amount suggested by the member for Batman. The House will be interested to know that this fact was confirmed in the social security legislation committee hearings in response to questions from the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Faulkner. So to make that suggestion flies in the face of any information that has been provided publicly. As the information was provided in an answer to a question by the opposition, one would have thought that the spokesman would have been apprised of them. In fact the opposition knew that the CEO was not being paid anything like that amount.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is really quite disgraceful that these allegations have been made. When the Labor Party were in office they established a number of agencies, one being the Australian Defence Industries, as a separate entity. I believe that in those circumstances the CEO was paid substantially larger amounts, quite unlike the circumstances pertaining here. In other circumstances, if being provocative, you would use terms to describe behaviour of that sort.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1639">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Batman has made comments doubting the credentials of the chairman, Mr Robin Marrett. The member has been selective in providing the background of Mr Marrett. It seems the honourable member for Batman believes that a corporate background makes a person unsuitable for the agency. In the government's view that is not correct. It qualifies him very much for the task. He has previously worked for Mobil Oil. He has a strong involvement and interest in the community, especially in working with young unemployed people. He has worked in the public sector before, for the South Australian government, in a statutory position. He has well rounded, relevant experience which we believe is well suited to the task.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been suggestions that we might punish the unemployed, attack those in need, and that there will be a reduction by amalgamating services, particularly in regional and rural areas. We would dispute each of these observations as they are made. We see the arrangements that we are making here as being a basis for delivering more efficient services; that is, the streamlining of services into a one stop shop. It was something that was very often talked about by members on both sides of the House over a long period of time, and this is a firm, determined move to achieve that outcome. The Labor Party had more than 13 years in office to be able to address some of these concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sometimes young people have to attend a social security office and also a CES office and there are instances where, for locational reasons, those offices are in different suburbs. That was the situation in my own electorate for some time. I had a social security office in west Ryde and a CES office in top Ryde. The public transport service was either on the railway line or on bus routes. Unless you had private transport, it was quite difficult to get from one side of Ryde to the other. A one stop shop for the provision of these services is something that people have put a great deal of emphasis on over a period of time. It reduces the complexity for individuals and for the community. The needs of people for a high quality service really are above the boundaries of Commonwealth departments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has a strong commitment to rural and regional Australia. The agency will have an extensive network of over 300 offices and services. There will not be a halving of services as has been suggested, I think mischievously, by some, particularly the member for Batman. We expect an increase in the number of agency shopfronts. The agency will build on the already available DSS network. It will not be a reduction in service in that sense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, the agency will have offices in Mareeba, Townsville and Cairns and an extensive range of offices in other parts of rural and regional Australia. It will provide specialist services. It will take on all the existing DSS offices, visiting services, teleservice centres, family service centres and retirement service outlets, which will form the core of the agency's service outlets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The implementation of the agency is taking a particular interest in the operations for improving services to rural and regional Australia. Visiting services will continue to smaller and remote towns. The special rural task force of the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) has been examining the effectiveness of information and services to rural areas. The recommendations of the task force will be taken into account in planning the agency's services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to unemployment and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Working Nation</EMPHASIS> and Labor's record, a number of speakers from the opposition have raised issues relating to employment policies. There is legislation before the parliament in relation to employment assistance and services. The debate on these issues is best dealt with in that context. The agency will, of course, deliver the unemployment services and assistance in the legislation which is passed by the parliament. The agency will
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1640"> have a wide range of specialist services to assist customers with special needs. For example, there will be extensive services for people from non-English speaking backgrounds, including multilingual telephone information, interpreting services, translation services, staff with multilingual and migration skills, and migrant liaison officers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor presided over the highest level of unemployment since the Great Depression of 11.2 per cent. Unemployment for youths was as high as 50 per cent in some areas. They threw one million Australians onto the unemployment scrap heap under what was termed by the former Prime Minister as `the recession we had to have'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is in that context that I simply say in relation to the comments by the honourable member for Namadgi that she is a new member. I do not blame her for the policies of the past, but her colleagues were in office for 13 years and had the opportunity to deal with those issues over that time. We have been in office for just under a year. This is a new and important initiative and it is one that ought to be taken at face value. It is designed to provide a better range of services, including, I might say to the honourable member for Namadgi, new employment service arrangements. They do not represent the death knell of the role served by the CES and they certainly do not represent a loss to the nation of the expertise now found in that organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For a start, some 3,000 staff will transfer from DEETYA to the Service Delivery Agency. Around two-thirds of those are CES officers. This is the expertise that the government has at the moment. That staff core will be able to be used in this service and, in our view, in a more efficient and effective way to assist clients. As I have said before, those employed in the agency will be employed under the Public Service Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In establishing the Public Employment Placement Enterprise as a wholly owned government company to compete with employment placement enterprises from the private and community sector, PEPE will be competing from a position of very substantial comparative advantage. In particular, it will have the very considerable advantage of over 50 years experience of the CES in this business area. That expertise is precisely in the areas of activity which will occur in this market. It will have staff who know the areas of business activity available in a region and where jobs might be available, it will know the job seekers and it will know the employers and other players who are committed to helping them. Further, those staff will be relieved of many of the constraints and inflexibilities which tie down those in the public sector, so that they can undertake their jobs in a more effective way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, the government has made it very clear that it will ensure that the PEPE is set up for success. The commitments made by the government to CES staff late last year on key terms and conditions of service were directed at reassuring the staff on these matters and thereby enabling them to focus their skills and energy on ensuring that it is the successful player that we intend and expect it to be. In short, far from throwing away what the CES has brought to the community over the last 50 years, we hope to build on that and provide a more effective contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will deal with some of the comments in relation to Working Nation. The former government spent something of the order of $2 billion in its last budget in an attempt to manipulate unemployment statistics. It spent $500 million on the new work opportunities program which had a four per cent success rate. You were four per cent more likely to get a job if you did that program than if you had nothing to do with it at all. It was not really a
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1641"> very successful program for the great majority of young unemployed if it only had a four per cent success rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cost per job per participant in the program was $143,000. An enormous amount of money was spent to obtain one person a job. I think the young persons involved would have perhaps preferred to have the $143,000. We have taken the best of Working Nation. We have sought to build on the case management technique and to get rid of some of the other more costly parts of the exercise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the few moments available to me, I will deal with&mdash;and I will watch the time&mdash;the start up costs of the agency. The member for the Batman cannot have it both ways. On the one hand he complains that the government is not providing adequate resources for the agency and then on the other he suggests that we are spending too much. The government is committed to setting up the agency to work effectively and to make sure it improves the services to customers and brings the services of a number of departments to one place. We are therefore prepared to make a substantial start up investment in the agency of $48.8 million, of which $36.1 million will be spent in the first year and $12.7 million in 1997&hyphen;98. The savings in 1997&hyphen;98 will offset the cost in that year. At the same time, the government expects that the agency will deliver efficiencies and savings to the budget by getting rid of the duplication that exists under the present arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) raised some issues in relation to child care. Obviously, the new child&hyphen;care arrangements are intended to come into force on 1 January 1998. Consultations are taking place in relation to those proposals with the child&hyphen;care industry. The outcomes will be considered by ministers. Legislation to give effect to the child&hyphen;care policy will mean that changes will be introduced in due course. That will be the proper time to debate those issues. The agency will administer the legislation, as passed by the parliament, and we will look at the most effective means of delivering child&hyphen;care assistance and the child&hyphen;care rebate. If this agency is the most appropriate way for that to be done then obviously that will occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will conclude my remarks by commenting on what the honourable member for Barton (Mr McClelland) said. He suggested that the administrative review of the agency's actions would be impossible. I am told that that is clearly incorrect. The growth of administrative review in Australia has been very considerable. I for one would, on many occasions, like to question the appropriateness of administrative review in many of the areas in which it now operates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this area, as the explanatory memorandum to the bill makes clear, the existing administrative review mechanisms&mdash;that is, internal review by authorised review officers and review by the Social Security Appeals Tribunal and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal&mdash;will continue to operate. The member for Barton also suggested that the chairman, the CEO, would have absolute discretion as to how they carry out their functions. That is clearly incorrect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have already noted, decisions of the CEO and officers of the agency, who will be taking decisions that will affect customers, will be open to the existing administrative review mechanisms. Further, the provisions that the member for Barton referred to, which confer power on the individuals concerned, are unexceptional when compared to the provisions of other legislation relating to statutory authorities. They merely ensure that the persons in question have the necessary powers to carry out the functions that are conferred upon them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Barton also suggested that, under the provisions contained in the bill, powers of delegation would be unfettered and could be exercised by an 18 year old on the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1642"> counter. Leaving aside the slight on 18 year olds&mdash;perhaps I should draw that to the attention of 18 year olds in the honourable member's electorate&mdash;this merely reflects what is currently happening in government departments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the Social Security Act, for example, powers are delegated. They are delegated as necessary and only to appropriate levels within the current department. The delegation arrangements will be of the same character under the agency. I think that ought to be understood. I do not think that the comments that have been made by honourable members in any way detract from the measures that are before us. They are worthy of support. I encourage this House to give the bill prompt passage.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak in this House on veterans affairs. I normally take the opportunity to do so in recognition of the important role that veterans play in the life of our community. The amendments that the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (1996&hyphen;97 Budget Measures) Bill introduces make minor changes to some of the measures in the veterans legislation. It effects change to mirror amendments made to a similar social security measure and introduces the further veterans affairs budget commitments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to reiterate this government's commitment to veterans, which is further demonstrated by this legislation we are dealing with. The government believes that veterans are important. In fact, when looking back at some of the documents we produced prior to the election which give an indication of this, I reflected on these words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition remembers and applauds the contribution of all war veterans for the freedom we enjoy today and recognises the special standing of the veteran community and their right to the highest levels of support and respect from today's community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Within the bounds of our economic capacity the Coalition will always attempt to err on the side of generosity in the levels of support it provides our Veteran community. This will be based on the fundamental principle that Government care and support ought to be extended to veterans and their dependants as compensation, not welfare.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">When we have debated these sorts of issues in this parliament over the years that I have been here, I have always been at great pains to remind people that when we talk about veterans benefits we are not talking about welfare; we are talking about compensation. I believe that all of our decision making in respect of veterans affairs needs to be based firmly on an understanding and an acceptance of that principle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was reminded by one of my colleagues a short time ago that it is only a couple of months before we commemorate Anzac Day again. I am sure that all members in this place look forward to Anzac Day as a very special opportunity to mix with the returned service personnel in our electorates. It is a day we enjoy and a day tinged with sadness as we remember those
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1643"> who paid the ultimate sacrifice. Once again, that day is coming around. For the older veterans it probably comes around all too quickly once a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition government has a very substantial array of matters within its veterans affairs policy. Some of them are enacted in this legislation that we are dealing with. Importantly, our commitment is underlined by our belief that all existing veterans entitlements should be maintained. We believe that there are some anomalies within the area of veterans benefits which have been of longstanding concern to the veterans community, and we are addressing a number of those.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One issue that needs attention is the continuation of the war widow pension to war widows who have been involved in a veteran remarriage. I raise this issue because I understand the government has undertaken to review a number of issues and this is one that seems to come up from time to time. A constituent raised it with me recently.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst I do not want to reflect in any way on a veteran's right to remarry, it does cause concern, particularly when we realise that many war widows have received that status&mdash;that is what it is&mdash;by virtue of the long service that they have given to a veteran. The fact that my mother happens to be a war widow probably colours my view of this to some extent. She cared for my father for some 40 years after the war before he eventually died of war of a war caused illness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did not want to take up a lot of time on particular matters, because they are not in any way contentious, but I did want to pick up on a couple of issues that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) raised in his second reading speech, and that he has been involved with in recent times. I commend him for his commitment to the Australian services nurses national memorial and I am pleased that the government has committed $100,000 towards that project. The minister paid tribute to nurses in his speech at the unveiling of that memorial on Saturday, 15 February, and in the dedication of that site on Anzac Parade which, of course, is a very fitting place for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other issue relates to the Korea war memorial, which is an ongoing matter of concern to the veteran's community, to which this government is committed. The government has committed $200,000 towards that project, and I am very pleased that it has. There is some concern within the Korean veteran's community that the project is not moving ahead as quickly as they would like it to. I have explained to them that the government has been very generous in its commitment and that, as with other memorials&mdash;like the nurses memorial and the Vietnam memorial&mdash;they need to be active in raising funds to bring that project to fruition. Nevertheless, I am pleased that the government has made that commitment to the Korea war memorial and I do hope that they will be able to meet the time commitments for its completion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to mention briefly the government's commitment to younger veterans, predominantly Vietnam veterans&mdash;although most of those are not quite so young these days, but I am sure they are quite happy to be described as younger veterans. Younger veterans also include veterans from some of the peacekeeping forces who have also achieved the status&mdash;I use the word `status' again because I think it is the right word to use&mdash;of having returned from active service. I am pleased that the government is committed to looking at the particular problems of younger veterans, Vietnam veterans in particular.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was very pleased that the minister recently announced his commitment to further research and investigate the effects on Vietnam veterans of chemical exposure to what is broadly termed
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1644"> Agent Orange; I am not sure that that is the actual chemical description of it. The minister has been committed to the Vietnam veterans' community in grappling with that issue and determining whether there is genuine cause for concern. I know that the veterans maintain that there is cause for concern; I believe that we need to carefully investigate that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the context of this legislation, I place on the record that I recently had the privilege of visiting Washington. Probably a large number of Vietnam veterans have visited the Vietnam veterans' wall of remembrance in Washington. It is the sort of thing that all Australians who are going to Washington should place on their itineraries.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="TAYLOR" NAMEID="OJ4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the member for Groom said, it is a moving experience. It is a poignant reminder to Americans and others that over 50,000 Americans gave their lives in Vietnam. Each one of those 50,000 names is inscribed on the marble wall. As we said, it is a moving experience to walk along that wall and see the impact of the sacrifices that so many Americans made in that war and to recognise that over 500 Australians also died in Vietnam. Whilst that might be a small number compared with the more than 50,000 Americans who died, in terms of Australia's commitments to wars, it is nevertheless a very substantial commitment. The Korea memorial, which is almost adjacent to the Vietnam memorial, is also well worth visiting. Australia made a significant contribution to the Korean war.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to pre-empt this to any great extent, but the minister is shortly to announce&mdash;it may have been this week&mdash;a program of commemorative activities to take place over the next four years. We all believed that Australia Remembers was an excellent year, and we paid due credit to the former minister, Con Sciacca, for the personal contribution he made. Perhaps ironically, the fact that he was running around Australia putting so much effort into that event meant that he did not attend to matters in his own electorate as diligently as he ought to have and, of course, he was not re-elected. We all pay him due credit for the effort he put in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am looking forward to seeing what the government is planning for this forthcoming four&hyphen;year program of commemorative activities. As the minister in his second reading speech on this legislation said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This program will publicly and proudly honour the debt owed by all Australians to our veteran community through a range of programs of commemoration and education, and through the restoration of important memorials.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is worthy of our support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said at the outset, the legislation before us is fairly straightforward and I imagine it is totally non&hyphen;controversial. I am sure it will be supported by the parliament. It delivers on some of our promises to veterans, and I am pleased to be part of a government which is committed to veterans. My two colleagues, both of whom have a particular interest in veterans affairs, and I will ensure that the government continues to not only honour its commitments to veterans but also resolve wherever possible some of the ongoing concerns that veterans have. There will always be concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I was in America I had a meeting with the American department of veterans' affairs. They also cannot keep everybody happy as there are obviously issues at the margin which are difficult to resolve. In fact, not only are they contending with a number of concerns of Vietnam veterans but also they are now having to deal with this Gulf War syndrome, which has created a huge problem for them and a new lot of veterans who are suffering illnesses for which they have to be cared. It was interesting to have that discussion with the American department and
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1645"> to find that on a day to day basis they also do some of the things that our department does here. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I try to give credit where it is due&mdash;it is not always due&mdash;so, in the presence of the department officials, I say that I really think veterans are very well served by our Department of Veterans' Affairs on the ground, at the coalface&mdash;not here in Canberra, I suspect, where the engine room is. I very rarely hear any criticism of the department, not so for the politicians or policies. I know you would agree, Madam Deputy Speaker, that with our facilities on the Gold Coast and Southport in particular our veterans are very well served by the staff of the Department of Veterans' Affairs.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to address certain aspects of the veterans affairs amendment bill, which seeks to build upon and ensure the government's commitment to our nation's veterans is continually enhanced. In detail, this amendment bill seeks to undertake measures pertaining to the transfer of carer service pensioners and carer income supplement recipients to the Department of Social Security and for the Department of Veterans' Affairs to pay and administer on behalf of the Department of Social Security the age pension of certain disability pensioners and their partners.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In little over a century, Australians have been under arms and engaged in war on some nine different occasions, not to mention several further peacekeeping missions abroad. These of course were engagements which I humbly say were begun by politicians but were fought and ultimately won by soldiers. It may be argued the conflict in Vietnam was a `police action' only, but to those who served and for those who lost loved ones, let me assure the House, it was without doubt a war&mdash;a battle which unmentionable pages in history have tackled and have told, story upon story, the passion it instilled in people both on the main front and on the home front. One of our great generals, Sir John Monash, of Anzac fame is quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The nation that wishes to defend its land and its honour must spare no effort, refuse no sacrifice, and make itself so formidable no enemy will dare assail it. A League of Nations may be an instrument for the preservation of peace, but an efficient army is a far more potent one.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The still strongly accepted ideal of having a standing army in this country has been counterbalanced by the reality that it is the homecoming, the aftermath of war, that has brought tremendous social cataclysm affecting every part of national life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is often incomprehensible for the Australians who did not go to war to know what happens on the battlefield. Soldiers who were `ardent innocents' leaving for war would return to an albeit continued stable world but where values had changed. Their homecoming, while not physically crippling, is, however, emotionally exhausting. As the Englishman and World War I veteran Tommy Atkins put it so eloquently, most returning soldiers know that `all one gains from war are taxes, widows, wooden legs and debt, and returning warriors should rust in peace or rot in hospital'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One can come away with an enormous bulk of material written about war that shines little, with little respect on leaders, on politicians and on the military manipulators of young men. However, I am heartened to know that this government, just like the previous one, continues to remain committed to ensuring that our veterans receive the recognition they so justly deserve&mdash;in the form of not just monuments, medals or certificates but the real lasting provisions of quality living and treatment, be it in the provision and administration of pensions or the carers who look after our veterans.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1646">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be remiss of me if I did not mention the former Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the Hon. Con Sciacca, for his very worthwhile contribution to the Australia Remembers program and on his personal interest in the welfare of our veterans. The current Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the Hon. Bruce Scott, follows the tradition of the importance of ensuring the contributions government makes to the veterans community is more than just sustained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia, through its Department of Veterans' Affairs, has recognised the debt of gratitude to our veterans community. Currently, the department is responsible for the care of over 300,000 veterans and their dependants. The coalition government has guaranteed to maintain all existing veterans entitlements. The bill corrects in most parts the anomalies in these entitlements. In addition, this bill improves the administration of these veterans programs and service delivery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the electorate of Paterson I represent many returned soldiers&mdash;many now retired and living in the water wonderland that is Port Stephens and particularly within Nelson Bay itself. Indeed, many more are etching out an existence on the land, in regional agriculture, in timber and increasingly the eco&hyphen;tourism centres of Gloucester, Bulahdelah and Dungog, to mention but a few.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Notably, some 3,000 service personnel are now posted to the RAAF base at Williamtown&mdash;a work force the same size as BHP at Newcastle, members may be surprised to know, and growing not only in number but, critically, in its importance to the region itself. Williamtown and indeed the Hunter is at the potential hub of being the aeronautical and avionics centre of excellence and production in Australia. It is a vision I have been keen to see enacted for some time now, and I will continue to do what I can to help chart its new course from a pipedream to reality and provide a new exciting economic spur to our region. It is also a vision, I am happy to say, the New South Wales state government is seemingly also becoming very chirpy about, which can only be of benefit to the Hunter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like many of my colleagues, I also proudly represent the local Vietnam veterans organisation, headed by President Brian Chandler and Secretary Barry Myer, within my local community. It is these people who are currently perhaps in greatest need of and will benefit most from the amendments in this bill. I therefore fully support the commemoration, health care, housing, rehabilitation and compensation measures the government is advocating with the general overriding support provided by the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you look at the amendments from closer range, the sensibility and practicality of this bill bears plenty of fruit. For instance, there is recognition of our Victoria Cross winners, currently numbering but three&mdash;Sir Roden Cutler, Mr Ted Kenna and our most recent one, from the Vietnam conflict, Mr Keith Payne&mdash;who will benefit from the change to pay an allowance of $2,500 per year instead of $250. That is the kind of recognition that I think you will agree, Madam Deputy Speaker, is both valid and very warranted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, the inclusion of the Commonwealth bearing the transportation costs when a cash strapped veteran dies away from his or her home whilst obtaining treatment will be of great benefit and will provide peace of mind to veterans generally and also to the families of veterans for those few facing that predicament. I know it will be an initiative particularly well received by veterans in rural and regional Australian communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment to correct the anomalies in the defence service home scheme thus extends those rights to personnel who have served in areas not previously covered, those areas being Cambodia, Somalia and Yugoslavia. I bring to the attention of the current minister, the Hon.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1647"> Bruce Scott, that there seems to be one group left out; that is, those who served in the Gulf War. That is an issue that does need to be addressed. Those from my electorate who went there should have no doubt that I will be taking up that issue with the minister in due course. In addition to the extension of rights outlined above, restrictions have been removed on a widower of an eligible World War II servicewoman to obtain another initial loan on the basis of his widower status. This bill is about equity for all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now wish to address in detail my support for the transfer of payments made to recipients of the carer service pension and carer income support to the Department of Social Security, where they will receive a carer payment. The amendments in this part of schedule 1 of the bill remove all carer provisions from the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986, allowing the recipients to transfer to similar payments under the Social Security Act 1991. The three streams of income support for carers in the Veterans' Entitlements Act are: carer service pension where caring for a service pensioner veteran; carer service pension where caring for a non-pensioner veteran; and, carer stream of income support supplement. These carer payments are similar to carer payments made under the Social Security Act. At present the Department of Veterans' Affairs pays carer service pensions to fewer than 100 carers. In comparison, the Department of Social Security pays carer pensions to approximately 24,500 carers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having only one department responsible for carer pensions will simplify the delivery of assistance to carers and promote administrative efficiency. The pension of those who might be adversely affected by this transfer to a similar payment under the Social Security Act 1991 is preserved in schedule 5 of this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This measure will be well received by the many veterans in my electorate of Paterson and, in particular, those who are residing at and receiving the carer pension in the Harbourside Haven Nursing Home at Shoal Bay&mdash;an outstanding facility administered by such genuine, committed, caring people as the Chairman, Bill King; Vice Chairman, Norm McLeod, Secretary, Don Folley; Treasurer, Arthur Wade, Councillor, Geoff Robinson; Manager, Gerry Monohan; and the staff from this excellent aged care facility, provided by Nelson Bay RSL and Citizens Retirement Village Ltd.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ex&hyphen;servicemen, such as the late Eric Buschell of East Maitland RSL and John Whiting, former secretary, are sadly missed by their community. This measure will also be well received by people such as Peter Lord, Secretary of the Maitland RSL; President Ernie Bulmer&mdash;a real personality; Ron Kennedy, President of Dungog RSL; and Peter Grigg, President of the Lemon Tree Passage RSL. The list goes on of outstanding contributors to the welfare of the returned service people and their families&mdash;people who give advice on almost a daily basis, supporting their communities. Having to deal with just one department will simplify this process enormously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other amendment relates to the payment of certain pensioners to allow the Department of Veterans' Affairs to pay pensions to certain disability pensioners. These amendments allow the Department of Veterans' Affairs, acting as agents of the Department of Social Security, to pay and administer the age pension, and in certain circumstances the spouse pension, of certain disability pensioners and their partners. Currently, some 38,000 veterans and their eligible partners are required to deal with both the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Department of Social Security. In addition to a Social Security age pension, they may also be in receipt of compensation in the form of a disability pension, mainly because of the incapacity arising from war caused injury or disease.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1648">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These veterans are not receiving service pensions as they have not rendered qualifying service as defined under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. The proposed agency agreements will be valuable to those dual pensioners who indicate that they would prefer to have their age pensions paid by the Department of Veterans' Affairs. In addition it will allow the payments to be made on the same pay day. Currently, the disability pension is paid fortnightly in one week and the age pension and spouse pension in the other week. To avoid windfall gains from the transfer, the first and any last payment would be a half instalment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The veteran community will welcome this change. Many representations have been made to my office and to the minister asking the government to allow the Department of Veterans' Affairs to pay all forms of income support to members of the veteran community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In essence, therefore, I recommend the amendment for the following reasons. The Department of Veterans' Affairs will be allowed to act as an agent for the Department of Social Security to pay and administer the age pension and sometimes the spouse pension of certain disability pensioners and their partners. The Department of Social Security rules will still apply&mdash;in other words, the DSS will still count the disability pension as income when assessing these payments. Certain age pensions and spouse pensions will be paid on the usual Veterans' Affairs pay day. Veterans will have the option to allow the DVA to act as an agent to avoid dealing with two departments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that we do owe the veteran community a debt that is impossible to repay&mdash;in other words, what price a life? As a nation, we have on many occasions demanded our young to bear arms to fight conflicts far away from our shores. We have sent them as ambassadors because of our belief that everyone is entitled to live a life free from violence and oppression with the rights of freedom of speech and religion, as we enjoy them in Australia. Often these young people come home maimed in body and in spirit. Often these injuries do not count until the veterans have aged and are not in a position to look after themselves any more. It is then that we have a huge responsibility to come to their assistance&mdash;indeed, as they came to ours when we, as a nation, called on them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Anzac Day and many other commemorative services, such as those for the Battle of the Coral Sea, Long Tan and poppy day&mdash;to mention but a few&mdash;demonstrate our continued interest in veterans. These services, however, do not necessarily reflect our real responsibilities to veterans. As legislators, we have a real, ongoing responsibility to ensure that our veterans will always receive the best of care and treatment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I seek to remind this house&mdash;and, indeed, all Australians&mdash;that in just under two months we celebrate a public holiday, that day being Anzac Day, on Friday, 25 April. Madam Deputy Speaker, through you, I ask that all Australians take time to remember, not just those who have passed, but those who live on in personal torture. We should not just treat Anzac Day as another day off, another long weekend, but as a day where we do pay true respect to those who have passed on and those who still survive.</PARA>

They must come to understand that for some it was harder to have lived than to have died. It can

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was certainly greatly moved by the speech of the honourable member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin). If ever a speech had a heart and soul in it, that one did.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the great privileges of being a federal member of parliament is in mixing with the veterans' community; it is something that I will always carry with me. Even though I have been in this job just under one year, I feel that it has been an enormous privilege to mix with that community, to go to various functions, to understand the problems that they continue to face, and to also see their vision&mdash;not just for their members and their own families, but also for the community, because they are a very community&hyphen;minded group of people. That is why this Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (1996&hyphen;97 Budget and Other Measures) Bill is very important in recognising that not only are there problems that have to be addressed in the legislation and improvements that have to be made but also that this group of people will not be forgotten by the community. We will be constantly examining the situation for betterment and improvement in their lifestyle and their day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day requirements, particularly those who continue to bear the wounds and scars of conflicts in which they have been involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the community aspect that I want to cover in addressing the bill in its various aspects. Recently I had the privilege of opening the Inverpine hostel and nursing home, which is situated in Ogg Road, Murrumba Downs, in my electorate of Dickson. What really struck me was the fact that there was so much infrastructure in the veterans' community&mdash;that is, the infrastructure and support of the ladies' committees, and all those things that are there to raise money and supplement the Commonwealth grants that were made to that particular program. It all came together: it was not merely a case of people demanding a hand&hyphen;out and preying upon the government to help them yet again; rather it was an integrated and working relationship between the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Department of Health and Family Services to produce a facility for the veteran community and the wider community which would benefit not only my electorate but the wider area as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my view, that sort of overall community involvement is a model for other community groups. It is very fashionable to see a number of community groups springing up, but I have not seen that same commitment to community fund&hyphen;raising and cooperation with the government in order to produce the product as I have seen in the veteran community. I therefore preface my remarks today by saying that the RSL and the veteran community have got together to be a model for so many other community groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill itself is the second part of the budget package which honours key pre&hyphen;election promises to the veteran community. It contains a number of amendments to the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. The general thrust of the amendments is administrative reform which reflects the dual aims of achieving greater efficiency in the delivery of services and directing resources into the greatest areas of need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill removes all carer provisions from the Veterans' Entitlements Act, allowing recipients to transfer to a similar payment under the Social Security Act 1991. The carer payments made under the provisions of the VEA are similar to the carer payments made by the DSS, so it certainly makes good sense to transfer the administration of these payments from the Department of Veterans' Affairs to the Department of Social Security. However, it is worth
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1650"> noting that the bill contains a saving provision which preserves the pension of those who might be adversely affected by such a transfer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill amends the Social Security Act to allow the Department of Veterans' Affairs, acting as agent of the Department of Social Security, to pay and administer the age pension and, in certain circumstances, the spouse pension of certain disability pensioners and their partners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, this is an amendment about streamlining administrative procedures. It gives age pensioners who also receive a disability pension an option to choose to be paid both pensions by the Department of Veterans' Affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In future veterans and their partners will have to deal with only one department. Again, this re&hyphen;emphasises the government's commitment to move to the `one&hyphen;stop shop' style of service provision which has been the hallmark of the administration of this portfolio by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recall last year that, when war widows were given the opportunity to receive their DSS benefits and DVA benefits from the DVA, most took advantage of the simplified regime. In the long run there will be savings in departmental resources but, more importantly, our veteran community will be better served by these administrative changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are also amendments relating to rent assistance, which recognise the somewhat anomalous situation that can arise where single people choose to share accommodation. Obviously this is an economy but in the end, where these sorts of economies are made, the veteran community at large will be better off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also makes a number of amendments that will mean that people who currently receive fringe benefits, but not service pensions, will no longer be entitled to receive those fringe benefits after 30 June, 1997. The segment of the veteran community to whom these amendments are directed consists of those whose income has been in excess of pension limits for the past four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is acting to redistribute available resources to areas of greatest need. There is great sense in these proposals because the government obviously is trying to ensure that the resources that are being spent are going to the areas of greatest need where the greatest benefit will result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has demonstrated by these measures a strong commitment to serving the needs of our veteran community and honouring their contribution and sacrifice. I think the proposals deserve the support of the house. It has been said all along that we must never forget the continuing sacrifices of the families of veterans who have passed on. When we examine these areas we must remember always that Australia owes a debt of gratitude that was referred to by the honourable member for Paterson, who preceded me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the great thing about the attitude of people in the veteran community is that they have a vision, they look ahead, they look to how best they can improve the circumstances of the members they serve and the infrastructure that exists and how they can bring the situation of veterans to the attention of the wider community and set a model for fundraising. In all those areas the veteran community is to be commended and, in particular, I am reminded of the veteran community in my own electorate who have done enormous work in their own and the wider community. I commend these measures to the house.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would also like to endorse the comments of the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin) in his support for veterans. From
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1651"> the outset we, as a government, need to be vigilant that these veterans are looked after and cared for. This country has a very proud record when it comes to war service. Soldiers on all sides know how brutal war is: it is wasteful and horrifying and the hidden cost to a nation is absolutely extraordinary. Because we, as a nation, are aware of this, Australia has a proud record of care for its veterans&mdash;the men and women who made it possible for me to be able to stand here today and participate in governing this country, the men and women who made it possible for Australians to have freedom of speech, freedom of worship and democratic elections.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The veterans we care for today served in many parts of the world&mdash;Europe, Asia and Africa. In my own electorate of Lilley I have four World War I veterans&mdash;Carl Howard, aged 95, Edward Smout, aged 99, Horace Bishop, aged 100, and Alfred Mansfield, aged 100. They are all active men and still enjoy a beer and a yarn. They kept all of us totally entertained last Anzac Day. A lot of the stories I could not repeat, but they were very entertaining. It was wonderful to see these gentlemen participate in the breakfast after the service at the War Memorial.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On Anzac Day this year they will be there again with the rest of the locals to remember their friends who were killed during the conflict and those who have passed on since. Each will lay a wreath at the local memorial and will stand with pride for the national anthem and the last post. These are proud men who, along with the veterans from other campaigns, epitomise the loyalty and strength of Australian mateship that was forged on the battlefields around the world. The coalition is firmly committed to their well being and care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill will help veterans even more by allowing the recipients of carers payments to transfer to the Department of Social Security. This will simplify the delivery of assistance to carers and help promote administrative efficiencies. Another change will simplify payments to and communication with veterans. Currently, veterans and their eligible partners are required to deal with both the Department of Veterans' Affairs, in relation to their disabilities, and the Department of Social Security, in relation to their age pension. Now pensioners can choose to have their age pension paid by the Department of Veterans' Affairs and thus avoid dealing with two departments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The popular support for a concept like this was demonstrated when most of the war widows, who also receive a social security pension, opted to receive all their payments from the Department of Veterans' Affairs. The government has delivered on their support and the change will build on the one&hyphen;stop shop approach to service provision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another change relates to the better targeting of income support benefits. This bill sets out a new maximum rate of rent assistance for single people who share accommodation. It is reasoned that people in shared accommodation bear reduced rental costs compared to those borne by single people living by themselves. The Department of Veterans' Affairs is implementing this policy initiative for equity reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government acknowledges Australia's debt of  gratitude to our veteran community and their invaluable and selfless contribution to our society and recognises the importance of developing the community's knowledge and understanding of the veterans' war experiences. The government has committed significant funding over the next four years for commemorative activities. These activities will proudly honour our veteran community through a range of programs of commemoration and education and through restoration of important memorials, including the Australian War Memorial.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1652">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On Saturday 15 February 1997, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Bruce Scott, was at the dedication of a site on Anzac Parade for the Australian services nurses national memorial. He described it as one of the most satisfying events he had taken part in since becoming minister. The dedication of this site is only the beginning. The task now is to raise the funds so that the memorial can be unveiled as planned in October 1999&mdash;the year which marks the century of Australian military nursing services. The government has pledged $100,000 to start the fundraising. It is memorials such as this one planned for Anzac Parade and throughout Australia that become the focus on Anzac Day and help communities remain aware of the service veterans have contributed to this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These initiatives demonstrate the 1996-97 budget's strong and unequivocal commitment to veterans and their families. As the minister said in his second reading speech, benefits and services will continue to be reviewed to maintain their quality, fairness and appropriateness. The government is also committed to improving efficiency in the delivery of these benefits and services. The outcome will be a system that is responsive to the changing needs of veterans and their families and one that directs resources to the greatest need. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;Firstly, I congratulate those members who have participated in this debate on the veterans' affairs legislation. I think it demonstrates the genuine interest of both sides of the parliament in the welfare of our veteran community and ensures that we do get it right as a government. I think there has generally been bipartisan support when it comes to issues relating to our veterans and war widows. I also thank the shadow minister for his cooperation as we have worked through this bill. There is perhaps going to be an amendment moved, but I have spoken to the shadow minister and he is generally supportive of the thrust of the bill, as expressed in his speech yesterday in the main chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my second reading speech, I outlined the measures in this bill. These focused on the rationalisation of administration of certain pensions between my department and the Department of Social Security. One of the other measures provided for changes to the rent assistance payable to single pensioners who share rental accommodation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I take this opportunity to foreshadow that the government intends moving a number of amendments to this bill. These amendments will add two other budget measures and will limit the application of a measure in the bill. This will mirror the policy that will be applied to social security payees. Other amendments will make a number of minor and technical changes to the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill as presented provides for a lower rate of rent assistance to be paid to single pensioners who share accommodation. This measure is intended to address a current anomaly where two single people who share accommodation can receive $80 a fortnight more in rent assistance than a pensioner couple. The rate of rent assistance for a single pensioner is higher per capita than for a couple. This recognises that, since they live alone, they have to bear the full cost of their accommodation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When people enter into an arrangement to share accommodation, it is inequitable that they should continue to be paid an amount of rent assistance that was designed to assist those who do not, or cannot, defray their living expenses in this way. The combined rate of rent assistance for single pensioners sharing accommodation will continue to be higher than the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1653"> amount per capita paid to a couple. This acknowledges the fact that the accommodation needs of most singles sharing will be different to those of a couple.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Social security legislation to effect a similar provision will commence later this year. Before the enabling legislation was passed by this parliament, the legislation was amended to prevent it from applying to disability support pensioners and carer pensioners. This bill provides for the transfer to social security of carer pensions paid under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 from the day these new rent assistance rates are to apply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the amendments I will move later in this debate will preclude the changes in rent assistance from applying to service pensioners or to those who receive an income support supplement because of their permanent incapacity to work. Those who receive income support, because of their incapacity, and their carers are excluded because a unique situation often exists where the shared accommodation arrangement has been entered into to assist the disabled person to continue to live in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would now like to talk about two budget measures that are to be added to this bill. One of the amendments I will move is to establish a vocational rehabilitation scheme for veterans. This government undertook to closely monitor the long-term care needs of Vietnam veterans. The scheme that is to be introduced into the Veterans' Entitlements Act will provide for early intervention for younger veterans leaving the forces and support for Vietnam veterans. This scheme addresses concerns that have been expressed that some veterans who leave the defence forces have difficulty in making the transition to, and remaining in, civilian employment. It also addresses the concerns that some incapacitated veterans have about participating in a rehabilitation program unless a safety net to protect their pension entitlements is guaranteed by legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The aim of the scheme is to assist veterans to find employment and to continue in employment. The development of the legislation for the scheme has been subject to extensive consultation with the ex&hyphen;service community. The proposed legislation was made available to key ex&hyphen;service representatives, and the amendments I will move reflect the outcome of that consultative process. This consultation and ex&hyphen;service community support is critical to the success of the scheme, details of which are being developed. I want to thank the veterans community for their assistance in developing this scheme. I particularly mention them because they have been extremely cooperative in ensuring that we are able to put this together, and their continued cooperation will be vital to the success of the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Consultation on the detailed content of the scheme will begin soon so it can be tabled before 1 July 1997. The legislation provides the authority for the scheme and enshrines key income protection for certain veterans who take up employment as a result of a rehabilitation program. The legislation also requires consultation with the ex&hyphen;service community before the scheme is finalised and before any changes of significance are made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The scheme will be available to all eligible veterans, but special provision has been made for those veterans who are receiving a disability pension or a service pension on the grounds that they are prevented by their incapacity from working full time. The legislation being brought forward will  guarantee that these veterans will not have their pension reduced&mdash;I repeat that they will not have their pensions reduced&mdash;while participating in a rehabilitation program under the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When a veteran begins work as a result of the program, general rate disability pensioners will continue to receive their usual rate of pension. Veterans on above general rate pensions,
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1654"> such as those on the T&amp;PI pension, will retain part of their higher disability pension. This removes the disincentive for pensioner veterans to participate in the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the veteran is a service pensioner, only part of the veteran's earnings from employment will be taken into account in calculating the rate of service pension. If at any time the veteran ceases employment, he or she will revert to the rate of disability pension payable when the rehabilitation program was initially undertaken. The amount of service pension will be determined using the usual income and assets test.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a safeguard, the scheme contains a provision that ensures that veterans will receive at least the same income, from earnings and disability pensions combined, as he or she would have received as a disability pensioner had the veteran not participated in the rehabilitation program and entered employment. These safeguards and guarantees are essential if veterans are to feel the confidence that they can only gain by volunteering for rehabilitation back into the work force, from which incapacity has previously prevented their participation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The benefits veterans may obtain from participating in a rehabilitation program go beyond the financial advantages. These programs increase a person's self&hyphen;reliance and ability to cope with life's tasks, provide opportunities for socialisation and can help improve the quality of the participant's life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second budget measure to be added to this bill mirrors changes Social Security is adopting to the treatment of superannuation for pensioners who are 55 years or older and who have received some income support payments for 39 weeks or more since they reached that age. Veterans with qualifying service can access an age service pension five years earlier than others in the community can draw age based income support. For male veterans, this means that they can obtain an age service pension from age 60. A lower age applies for female veterans&mdash;now nearly 55&half; years. The pension age for women is gradually being increased to the same age as applies for male veterans; that is being done over a graduated period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The superannuation of people who have reached pension age is currently included in the assessment of their service pension. If the veteran has not reached pension age, a service pension can be paid only if the veteran is permanently incapacitated for work. The new measure will apply to people who have ceased to participate in the work force and who have access to superannuation because they cannot work or have reached retirement age. For this reason, the superannuation held by pensioners aged 55 or more is to be included in the assessment of their income support payments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is reasonable and equitable that their superannuation is used for the purpose intended, and that public funds are not used to support those who choose not to draw down on moneys that have been set aside for use when they have retired or cannot work. If some pensioners cannot draw on their pension until a later age, the minister can determine that the new provisions do not apply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, this legislation under consideration offers significant support to the rehabilitation of Vietnam and younger veterans, greater administrative efficiencies and better targeting of income support payments. I reiterate my thanks to all those who have participated in the debate and also to the shadow minister for his co&hyphen;operation and assistance in ensuring the passage of this bill. As I said earlier, I know he will probably be moving an amendment in the House, but he generally supports the thrust of the bill. I do thank the opposition for their support in this matter.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Monday morning, I picked up a copy of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> , as I usually do, and I was surprised to read that the Labor Premier of New South Wales, Mr Bob Carr, was warning the federal government of a national health care crisis if the slump in private health insurance was to continue. The article quoted him as saying that the decline in private health cover was already swamping the public health care system and costing New South Wales public hospitals approximately $250 million a year. Mr Carr went on to say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no doubt falling rates of private health insurance have had a major impact on state hospital services.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">These comments make me speculate that if Mr Carr had been in this House yesterday which side of the House would he have voted with. I am positive he is pleased this government's private health insurance measures were passed as this bill addresses many of Mr Carr's concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Earlier, I had hoped to speak to the bill directly. However, I am glad for this opportunity during the appropriations debate to make some of the points that I feel very strongly about. As a health professional and someone who has had a long career in the health care area, I am well aware that we need to ensure that the private health care system remains an integral part of our health system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am a supporter of Medicare. Australia's system works well when compared to other nations' health care systems. Medicare, as a universal health care system, works reasonably well, but it is in decline. Our health care system is not working as well as it should nor as well as it can if the right changes are made and people are given greater incentives.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1656">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my electorate of Canning we have the situation where many people are continually waiting and queuing for available beds at the Armadale Kelmscott Public Hospital whilst at the nearby Gosnells Family Hospital, a private hospital, beds are often empty. I would suggest that that is a ludicrous situation. When the Treasurer (Mr Costello) handed down the first coalition budget in 13 years I was particularly pleased to hear that the government pledged to fulfil its pre&hyphen;election promise of private health insurance incentives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has honoured its election commitment to make private health insurance more affordable for lower and middle income families. From 1 July this year, families with dependent children who already have or decide to take out private health insurance will be entitled to receive an incentive of up to $450 per year, which can either be an up-front reduction in their premiums or a tax rebate. This will make private health insurance more affordable for families. It will also have the added benefit of helping to reduce the upward pressure on the cost of private health insurance premiums.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the budget, the government also delivered on its election commitment to fund a range of preventative health measures through our health throughout life program. The  government has kept its election commitment to maintain Medicare in its entirety, including bulkbilling. However, if all Australians are to enjoy the benefits of high quality health care, it is vital that we re-establish a better balance between the public and private health care systems. The coalition believes that people should be encouraged to provide for themselves and their families through private cover. With people living to a greater age and technological improvements in the medical field, it is imperative that we change society's expectations about our health care system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was interested to read in the August 1996 edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Health and Age Care Journal</EMPHASIS> that repeated surveys have indicated that most Australians believe in user&hyphen;pays systems with a safety net provision, equitable access to community services and honesty from their elected representatives. It is imperative that we encourage people back into private health insurance because if we do not the future for our children looks very bleak indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the same edition of that journal, Mr Denis Hogg, the Chief Executive Officer of Epworth Private Hospital said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The move by the government to reduce the burden of the cost of health insurance is the only positive initiative we have seen in this area for many years and we cannot afford to have it jeopardised in any way. The federal health minister wants to help boost insurance levels and we must do everything possible to support him.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I could not agree more. The latest health insurance figures, released earlier this month, showed that the continuing decline in the number of Australians with private health care reached for the first time below the figure of one-third of the community. This should be of grave concern to all players in the provision of health care services and force them to review their position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Productivity Commission's report on private health insurance is to be released very soon. I anticipate that the report will outline some practical solution which will help address the current situation, and to this end the government's legislation, which is now on its way to the Senate, is the first step.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Only last week I, together with the local state member for Southern River, Mrs Monica Holmes, met with representatives from the Gosnells Family Hospital in my electoral office in Canning.

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1657"> circumstances. I outlined to them in detail the proposed measures, and they all agreed without exception that the government is on the right track.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, these measures alone will not solve all of our health care problems, and no-one is pretending that they will. However, we are taking real steps to ensure that the system improves. After one year of being in government, the coalition has done more to attract Australians to private health insurance than the Labor Party was ever able to do.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Health insurance should be like any other form of insurance: we insure our cars, and I am sure the member opposite does; we insure our homes, and I am sure he does that, too; and, of course, we insure our contents. So why should we not insure ourselves for health?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to put on the record my support for the government's strategy to increase the level of private health coverage by the introduction of a one per cent Medicare levy surcharge on those individuals who have taxable incomes above $50,000 per year. The levy surcharge will also apply to families with a combined income greater than $100,000 per year who do not have private health insurance. This means that a single person on $50,000 taxable income will pay an extra $500 per year through the Medicare levy and a family who earns $100,000 will pay an extra $1,000 per annum if they choose not to take out health care cover.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I am talking about our health care system, I would like to make special mention of my concern about the gap. Some members may have seen an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Telegraph</EMPHASIS> on 2 February this year which outlined the stories of two men who both had lifesaving bypass operations which were performed by the same surgeon in the same week. One gentleman had faithfully paid into his private health insurance fund for years; the other had opted out of private cover when he became a pensioner and could no longer afford it. The gentleman with private health insurance is now faced with a bill for $6,000, which he is paying off very slowly. The other gentleman received one bill for a post&hyphen;operative consultation for the princely sum of $9.80.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This story indeed brings home the realities of our health care system. Something must be done about the gap. People who are paying for private cover are doing the right thing. Some find paying for their health insurance a real financial struggle and others can easily afford to do so. But all of them rightly complain and feel outraged when they are hit with massive bills which they often are in no position to pay. This is simply wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I listened with interest over the past few days as speaker after speaker from the opposition condemned private health insurance incentive legislation before this House. It was almost impossible to comprehend their hypocrisy. During the last election campaign, former Labor health minister Graham Richardson had this to say about private health insurance:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unfortunately, Labor aren't recognising the big problem. It is still a huge problem . . . that people are deserting private health insurance at the rate they are. It isn't a problem any of you&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I suppose he was referring to Labor&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">will worry about tomorrow, but in 10 years time it will be huge.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">At least Graham Richardson recognised the problem, which is more than I can say for those Labor members who still have their heads in the sand, hoping it will all just go away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The need to improve our health care system is urgent. If we left the system to the Labor Party, the system would by now be at the collapsing stage. Many elderly and aged pensioners
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1658"> have been frightened of what may happen if they became seriously ill. They ask themselves, `Will I get a hospital bed? Will I be treated immediately?' They worry that if they need elective surgery they may need to wait six or 12 months, or even longer. Their concern is very real indeed. Older Australians understand the need to insure for their health and they continue to take out private insurance which, in many cases, is a huge sacrifice for them to make.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The drift away from private health insurance has put extra demand on our public hospitals. One only has to visit one's local hospital to witness the chaotic situation, with people lying in beds in corridors, waiting for hours and hours to be seen by a doctor or nurse, who are often overworked and harassed but are always trying their best. It paints a picture of confusion, frustration and anarchy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Only last week an elderly constituent from my electorate of Canning told me of how her husband, who had undergone serious surgery, was sent home, in her opinion prematurely, because his bed was needed for someone else. This is not an uncommon story. It is not uncommon because the former Labor government allowed our health care system, which I believe was once the best in the world, to degenerate. Under the former Labor government, the proportion of Australians with private health insurance plummeted from 60 per cent to less than 35 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This has put an unprecedented strain on the public health care system and has been accompanied by significant increases in the cost of private health insurance premiums. Despite the high cost of premiums, millions of Australians&mdash;many of whom are low income earners and pensioners&mdash;spend often considerable proportions of their incomes ensuring that they have a guaranteed hospital bed and the doctor of their choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before the election, the coalition made a commitment to provide financial incentives to low and middle income families and individuals in recognition of the financial costs entailed in looking after their own health care needs. This budget delivers on that commitment. David Walsh, from Medibank Private, said last year in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Health Law Bulletin </EMPHASIS>volume 4 No. 10:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite some ideologically-driven views that there is no need for a private health sector, the simple economic reality is that Australian governments can no more afford to completely fund the health system than those same governments can afford to cover the costs of what constitutes private education.</PARA>

I am particularly pleased that the new health care measures will provide a genuine and real encouragement to those people seeking a choice, particularly those older and chronically ill people, many of whom are on pensions or low incomes, who scrimp and save to keep paying for their private cover.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support these appropriation bills and wish to focus my attention on two specific areas: road transport and the Antarctic. I am sure I speak for all members when I say that I was delighted to see $148 million allocated to local government to improve sites with a history of dangerous accidents in all our electorates. But I was quickly brought back to the realities of Labor politics when I discovered that the Brisbane City Council, under the leadership of Labor, had attempted to use the program to recoup money for works already completed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The black spot program is designed to give individuals in our community the chance to have a greater say in how road funding is spent. Yet Brisbane's Lord Mayor, Jim Soorley, forwarded applications for 15 black spot sites, knowing full well that half of them were not relevant. Seven of the Brisbane City Council's applications were for work that was already commenced or had been completed this financial year, totalling $1,289,400. Such nominations are beyond the intent and the spirit of the program and are tantamount to fraud.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, of the 15 nominations presented by the Brisbane City Council for black spot funding, more than half did not meet the criteria. To me this is an indication that Jim Soorley and his team did not take the program seriously, nor did they do their homework, other than to make false and unethical claims. That Jim Soorley obviously did not see this program as a chance to improve the safety of the roads of our city is not just a sign of greedy politics but a slap in the face for the people of Brisbane.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The trauma alone which results from death or serious injury on our roads is immeasurable. In the next 20 years road trauma will become the second largest cause of loss of productive life, ahead of other causes like disease in the developing world. It is also extremely expensive in day&hyphen;to-day dollar terms. In 1995 there were 58 fatal accidents, and another 825 people were seriously injured in crashes in Brisbane city. The cost to the people of Brisbane of these tragic accidents is just under $140 million. We could build another hospital for that amount.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we consider that this $140 million is for just one year, we see that road death and injury creates a massive economic loss to a local community. Every year the cost of accidents, death and injury on our roads could be used to build dozens of primary schools, child-care centres, nursing homes and other necessary community structures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government's effort to bring down the road toll is not just to save dollars but to improve the lifestyle of the community. The cost in human suffering can never be met. But a community suffers from road trauma both in dollars and in pain, therefore, improving our roads, recognising danger areas and expanding driver education are all part of the solution. Australia's record, while far too high, is much lower on a world scale, but it can always be improved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Putting road safety directly into the hands of the community, as in the black spot program, is an innovative move. Its importance becomes even more relevant when we see how readily and quickly Jim Soorley and the Brisbane City Council responded. He nominated sites all right, but they had already been completed. He tried to redirect black spot funding to pay other bills. To me that is sneaky. It also smacks of arrogance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The black spot program is part of the government's three&hyphen;pronged attack on road trauma: vehicle safety; driver education; and, finally, the hardware, that is, the construction and maintenance of suitable roads.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is just a matter of filling in a form and sending it to the government's black spot consultative panel. As to those residents who feel that even this is difficult, I will fill in the forms for them and see they are handed over to the panel. I believe immediate action is necessary to ensure the people of my electorate have full advantage of the program and to bypass the greedy paws of Jim Soorley's Brisbane City Council. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I move now to a completely different matter which comes under Appropriation Bill (No. 3), Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories. I refer to our specific presence in the Antarctic. As a member of the government's environment committee, I was able to visit the Antarctic during the summer break and inspect our three bases. I was accompanied by the director of the Antarctic division, Rex Moncur, who was able to answer all my questions in great detail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have reported to the government that I believe it is vital we maintain our strong presence in this remarkable region. To do this and to increase accessibility for our scientists, I believe we should construct an airstrip on one of our bases. You, Mr Deputy Speaker, as the member for Cowper this week called on the government to endorse the value of our Antarctic science programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was not surprised to see that motion seconded by the member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), who had ministerial responsibility for the region in the 1980s and has a great understanding of its value. Our scientific studies in the Antarctic are part of an ongoing international program. We share knowledge and skills, not to mention equipment and facilities, with scientific personnel from 41 nations which are members of the Antarctic Treaty. This research ranges from global environment issues, such as depletion of the ozone layer, to the study of movement of the Great Southern Ocean and, of course, the mysteries captured in the ice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This pristine continent is in fact an instant environmental record, stretching back over 200,000 years. But only a dedicated core of scientists can afford to make the long and slow sea journey, and even fewer can stay for the winter months when the base is inaccessible to the rest of the world. An airstrip would allow a wider section of our scientific community quicker and easier access to the Antarctic and obviously would allow more time for their research.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian scientific research team is currently involved in several scientific programs, working in collaboration with scientists from Norway, the United States, Canada, Chile and South Africa. It should go without saying that our continued non-political collaboration with other nations is just as important as the sharing of the results of the research. The strategic nature of Antarctica must also be considered when we look to funding our bases there. Many other nations are interested in the fate and future of this unique region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The treaty stipulates that the region should forever be used exclusively for peaceful purposes. It also prohibits the introduction of any measures of a military nature. Mining is also prohibited. But while the treaty guarantees freedom of research and promotes the exchange of information, there is always the question of the region being opened up for other causes. Tourism is one area being discussed. To ensure we have a strong and permanent presence in this area to both protect it and our country in the future, I support any consideration for ongoing funding to our Antarctic division.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to speak on some of the major reforms that are happening in the sugar industry, particularly the implications those reforms will have in New South Wales. Before I go into some of the nuts and bolts of what the Queensland task force has recommended to the Queensland government, to the sugar industry and to the federal government, I think it is important that this House realises the significance of the sugar industry to New South Wales.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The industry is well over 100 years old. It was formed in the 1860s and has survived many changes. It is a vital industry in northern New South Wales, particularly in the electorate that I represent&mdash;Richmond. Over 1,300 families are directly involved with sugar production. Over 550 of those are independent landholders. Indeed, when you look at the multiplier effect, about 450 people are directly employed in the mills and over 400 people are directly involved in the harvesting operations and other auxiliary functions that the industry provides.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today in New South Wales the industry has a direct value of $65 million. That makes it the biggest agricultural industry in our region. On conservative estimates, with a multiplier effect of about 3.4 times, we are really looking at an industry across the Tweed, Richmond and the Clarence valleys valued at around $200 million. So the industry is of particular importance to us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to congratulate New South Wales cane growers&mdash;I am sure my colleagues here will be listening to that&mdash;because a number of years ago when CSR moved out of New South Wales, the growers got together and formed their own co&hyphen;operative and, in due course, actually built their own mill, in partnership with Manildra. This was particularly important because they went into the refined sugar market as opposed to being involved only in the bulk export of raw sugar. They had to do this to be competitive against the Queensland market, which produces over 95 per cent of the crop in Australia. I do believe there is a small amount now grown in Western Australia. Up to $45 million&mdash;a large investment&mdash;was spent in the late 1980s, early 1990s in upgrading that mill. It was very successful. They were able to compete and capture a lot of the domestic refined sugar market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">CSR actually closed one of their terminals in Sydney&mdash;probably for other reasons&mdash;so it gave that foundation to the New South Wales industry. They produce around 280,000 tonnes of sugar, of which 250,000 is refined and the other 80,000 is raw. We are very much the second cousin to our Queensland counterparts, although I would like to inform this House that we certainly produce much more higher quality sugar, particularly in the area I represent&mdash;the Tweed Valley.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sugar industry in Queensland produces a crop of 37 million tonnes versus in New South Wales a crop of around 280,000 tonnes. The reason I am very concerned at the moment is that the recommendations of the task force, which have been pushed along by national competition policy&mdash;the precursor to which was the Hilmer reforms&mdash;will have a major impact on the sugar industry right across Australia, but particularly in New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The package that was put together advocates three main recommendations. Firstly, it advocates that single desk selling be re-established. Single desk selling is not of much benefit to New South Wales because we are not part of the Queensland Sugar Corporation. Secondly, it advocates the retention of consignments. For those who do not know, consignments are where they have agreed quotas, let us say, for the growing to the mill stage&mdash;with the mills being owned by the Queensland Sugar Corporation. Thirdly, it advocates the removal of the tariff.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1662">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In their wisdom, and in order to comply with national competition policy, the Queensland task force deemed it necessary to trade off one of the elements. They chose the tariff. The tariff does not have a significant effect in Queensland, except on those mills, particularly in North Queensland, which the member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) has been very vocal about. It has a major impact on New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The removal of the tariff in New South Wales represents about $8 million to our industry. Because the bulk of the sugar in Queensland is exported&mdash;it is raw sugar not refined sugar&mdash;the removal of the tariff amounts to about $23 million. Some $8 million to an industry which produces five per cent of the nation's crop is far more significant than $23 million to an industry that produces 95 per cent of the nation's crop.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My concern is that the whole rationale for the reduction in tariffs under national competition policy is that the end result is lower consumer prices and that is why we are going through this. National competition policy has been good for the big end of town. It has been good for the electricity industry, it has been good for the gas industry and it has been good for big infrastructure projects, but I question its value when it comes to smaller communities and producing lower consumer prices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the last couple of years in Queensland we have actually seen a proliferation of very large refineries established. Years ago CSR had the monopoly in Queensland. During the late 1990s there were legislative changes which meant that a number of mergers could not take place and a new mill was formed in Mackay. There was also a smaller mill formed in Bundaberg, which began in the early 1960s. Basically, it was a CSR market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Mackay mill did not have a market share so they began a discounting price war. Unfortunately, all major refineries are suffering huge losses as a result of this ludicrous policy of discounting prices to buy market share. I wonder whether one of the driving influences behind the recommendations of the Queensland task force is a great desire by some of the refineries to try to reduce their losses. Obviously, the clearest way to exit out of this situation is to do away with the tariff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tariff is applied on an import parity basis. Initially, it was there to stop cheap foreign imports being dumped in this country. The House should know that Australia is the most efficient producer of sugar and we do not have major subsidies. When you look at countries like Thailand, you find that they have subsidies for their sugar farmers of 104 per cent. If you look at the Europe, the EEC, you find there is a 170 per cent subsidy for sugar beet. The level playing field does not exist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are competitive, but there was a tariff. The embargo was taken off at the beginning of the 1990s. It is now down to $55 a tonne and with recent falls the price is about $38. My concern is that part of the agenda is to stop the huge bleeding that is going on in some of these mills. The other side, which is being advocated by the soft drink industry, is that by having a more competitive environment and no more tariffs it will result in lower consumer prices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Dawson (Mrs De&hyphen;Anne Kelly) in the parliament the other day drew to our attention what has happened to prices in respect of sugar, particularly in the two biggest areas that consume sugar&mdash;and we all like our soft drinks and chocolates. When you look at the ABS statistics from 1989 through to the last December quarter, you will see that there has been an increase of 52 per cent in the price of chocolate and an increase of 34.7 per cent for soft drinks and cordials.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1663">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This has occurred in a period when the tariff has been coming down and when the CPI has increased by only 29.5 per cent. So we are getting a far greater acceleration in prices which is outstripping inflation. Tariffs are being reduced, so the actual costs to the mills are reducing, yet prices are still rising. It begs the question: where are the profits being made? Of course, they are being made in the manufacturing sector. I stand here and say that I will eat my hat if I see the consumer prices of those commodities start to fall over the next couple of years.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps it will be a chocolate hat. In New South Wales these reforms will have a major impact on our industry. The idea of removing the tariff is to make the industry more competitive and to have some rationalisation. As a member for a New South Wales electorate, I say that we will not be steamrolled by a task force that wishes to see the exit of one of the refineries. There are four refineries around Australia, and it will not be New South Wales or the partnership that New South Wales cane growers have with Manildra that will be steamrolled.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sugar industry is vital for our area. We are undergoing urban expansion. We have one of the highest unemployment rates in Australia and the highest in New South Wales. It is an old industry but one that we need to protect. What is good about the sugar industry is that it is a closed loop. Everything is used. Sugar goes in. The refined sugar comes out and the waste, which is a gas, can be put back through the mill or it can be trashed back on to the fields. Indeed, cane growers in New South Wales are being quite progressive. They have put boilers in, and I hope that in the not too distant future we will be able to connect into the grid and supply power. So it will be a total closed circuit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real point is that with the reduction of tariffs we in New South Wales are going to be worse off. It is going to affect New South Wales growers, and we will not be steamrolled on this issue. The bare minimum that is required is a package for the New South Wales industry. Discussions are going on now, and, of course, the first area to consider is infrastructure. We may have to get back into raw sugar production. Because there is so much competition with refined sugar, we may have to get back into the export industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I congratulate the mill because not so long ago it got a contract with the Singapore government to export about 20,000 tonnes. If we are going to get back into the export market, we need good infrastructure to survive. There are proposals for the port of Yamba, but maybe we need to think a bit more laterally about how to make it more efficient. At the moment there are new facilities at Fisherman Island, in the port of Brisbane. Obviously we may have to rely on that in the future to get more overseas markets. So we need infrastructure, and we need some money from the Commonwealth government for compensation in that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point is that we need to have access to the US market. There is a quota at the moment, and the Queensland government has had 100 per cent of it. It is a very lucrative market. At the moment raw sugar prices are about double in respect of the world prices. So, if we are to take that huge downside from these recommendations by the Queensland task force, we in New South Wales must have that US quota. I say to this parliament that we need more than our five per cent because we are taking a much bigger hit. I would think that eight per cent is a good starting point for a quota.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third point relates to bulk terminals. When CSR was responsible for the mills in New South Wales, and for that matter across Australia, there was always a pool going into maintaining and building some of the big raw sugar terminals, which are allocated in Brisbane.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1664"> Naturally, when CSR moved out of the New South Wales industry, we did not continue to pay for it. But it is estimated that from the time of the beginning of our industry through to 1989, when the partnership broke, $350 million was put into those bulk terminals. Five per cent of that, which represents five per cent of the crop, is $17&half; million. So in future negotiations that the government has with the Queensland growers, I hope that there will be some recognition of the money that we put in there and that it will also come back to us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last point which I think this government needs to look at is that perhaps we need to see some rationalisation&mdash;which is not being forced by the tariff reduction&mdash;in the Queensland industry, perhaps through some of the takeover provisions which have prevented some of the major mills from coming together. Naturally, of course, there was Mackay and Tate and Lyle and CSR. If we could see some amalgamations, this discounting price war that we are getting at the moment would cease and prices would come back to the normal level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of the day, I fear that, along with the tariff reduction, it may send a signal to the buyers of refined sugar&mdash;the big confectionary companies or the big suppliers of sugar into products&mdash;that they have an excuse to force the price down even lower than $37 a tonne. The actual tariff at the moment does not really have a big impact when you are looking at overseas markets, because we are below that price. So if there is a reduction in consumer prices&mdash;I hope there is not, because we are efficient&mdash;I will be totally surprised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were some important meetings within the government last week and there will be more such meetings in future. The member for Page (Mr Causley), who is himself a sugar producer, has been very supportive of the industry, along with me. I do hope that an adequate package is put together for the New South Wales industry, for all those people involved. We must protect and encourage that industry. It is efficient. There are a lot of people involved in it. It is our biggest rural industry. I am sure that many Queensland colleagues within the coalition will be supporting us to ensure there is an adequate trade off if the tariff is to go. I question whether there was much merit in that task force in the first place, but I am sure that history will outline that. I conclude by saying that the New South Wales sugar industry is not going to be steamrolled by the Queensland task force. We want adequate compensation, and we are going to go hell for leather to get it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Communications and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yes. The National Transmission Agency, which is responsible for the terrestrial transmission of all national broadcasting services, has recently become
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1666"> aware of complaints suggesting a general deterioration in the reception of ABC Television in certain parts of northern Perth, particularly affecting a small number of residents in Ocean Reef and Gwelup. An investigation conducted by an NTA officer, between 9 and 13 December 1996, has found that the NTA's facility which transmits ABC Television from Bickley is operating properly, and that the signal levels for both ABC and SBS television in the areas concerned are normal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency has informed me that the perception that reception of ABC Television had deteriorated appears to stem from the poor siting and/or poor quality of domestic reception equipment in some households. In two cases, the source of a recent deterioration was, in fact, interference caused by domestic alarm systems installed in the houses of persons complaining about poor reception.</PARA>
