<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the House insists on disagreeing to amendments Nos 1, 4 to 22, 24 to 27, 29 to 34, 36, 38, 39, 47, 49 and 54 insisted on by the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I am disappointed that the Senate dealt with this matter in such a perfunctory way earlier this week by criticising the government in general terms and dealing with irrelevant considerations instead of debating the substance of the matters before it. The concentration of the debate in the Senate on the issue of the government purporting to establish a double dissolution trigger by this legislation was both unworthy and inaccurate. It is especially spurious for the shadow Attorney&hyphen;General to assert that this is `a cover for a race based election'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has indicated in the past its desire for the streamlining of the way in which government regulations are produced and scrutinised in order to ensure regulations are relevant, workable and effective and that any unnecessary regulatory burden on business and the community is removed. At the same time, the government has modelled the legislation to ensure that the government is able to maintain control of important programs for which it has a responsibility to the community. It has done so by providing minimum exemption from compliance with parts of the legislative package or by exempting parliamentary disallowance of certain limited instruments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current restriction by the Senate, preventing exemption from disallowance of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> quarantine proclamations based on broad based international negotiations, exemplifies the type of approach which can cause significant difficulties in control of government programs. The  Legislative Instruments Bill 1996  represents the product of substantial work by an independent statutory body charged with reviewing the administrative law structures of the Commonwealth and the significant input of the numerous parliamentary committee considerations of the bill as it evolved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the most significant issues to come out of the parliamentary consideration by the 1995 Labor chaired House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs was the recommendation that sunsetting of all delegated legislation be provided for. This bill gives effect to that recommendation. Now the opposition is trying to move away from sunsetting, making spurious claims that the provisions allow the government to renege on continuing desirable delegated legislation following its sunsetting. This attack on the bona fides of the executive is both unworthy and ill&hyphen;informed. The government will always consider the continued desirability of delegated legislation in an appropriate way and would only remove it should such legislation be unnecessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is an important reform package which will result in fundamental changes to the relationship between the executive and the parliament. The government is voluntarily accepting changes which will significantly increase the power of the parliament to scrutinise delegated legislation. The opposition and the minor parties in the Senate now suggest that the government is treating them with contempt because it does not accept amendments passed by the Senate. Nothing could be further from the truth. This bill has gone through a very careful and even tortured process in its development. It is a reasoned and appropriate response by the government, which, as the government of the day, has to make the final call over what is the appropriate balance between executive responsibility and parliamentary scrutiny and acceptance of delegated legislation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I was interrupted by question time yesterday, I was talking about the Hunter Valley No. 1 dispute. I was reading a letter from a Mrs Lyn McBain, who is the wife of one of the Hunter Valley No. 1 coalminers. I will pick up where I left off. She said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My first hand knowledge of these laws Sir, indicate that a company like Rio Tinto can call upon their global resources of $14 billion to bring 420 miners to their knees, but the workers and the union cannot call for the assistance of any other union or identity because it would be seen as a secondary boycott.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I fear that in future companies with global resources will starve workers into accepting lower wages, substandard work conditions and the abolition of safe work practices.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">These are not my words; these are the words of a very desperate wife, a very desperate grandmother and mother. Another miner's wife has been writing poetry about the dispute. I was going to read that to the House, but I fear I am going to run out of time. I therefore seek leave to table the poem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leave granted.</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8K6">Mr FITZGIBBON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the minister. As I said yesterday just prior to question time, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is no friend of the coalmining community. His bipartisan support for these large multinational companies, both Rio Tinto and Arco, has been nothing short of disgraceful. Now we see the government supporting Rio Tinto's appeal against Justice Boulton's decision to force the matter to arbitration. It is quite clear that this is not a dispute either the government or Rio Tinto want resolved. This is their opportunity to use the new Workplace Relations Act to break the back of the trade union movement in this country. As I have said, that has been highlighted by the government's support of Rio Tinto's appeal against Justice Boulton's decision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the message that the Hunter coalminers want to send to the Prime Minister: you are no friend of the coalmining communi 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="12207"> ty, and your attempts to portray yourself as such does no credit to you or the office of Prime Minister. As I said yesterday, it was absolutely outrageous and the height of hypocrisy for the Prime Minister to be standing in this chamber, in question time on 18 November, portraying himself as a friend of the coalminer. I recognise that my behaviour on that day was contrary to standing orders. But I will take every opportunity&mdash;if that is what it takes, so be it&mdash;to defend my coalminers, the coalminers who are being so unfairly treated by Rio Tinto, with the rather unashamed support of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I move on to another issue that arose out of question time. It was the contention of the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Vaile) that this government is doing so much more than was previously done for roads in this country. Over four years we have had $600 million cut out of the national highways budget. I think the minister is a great bloke and very capable, but I am very concerned about his appointment as the minister for transport. There is a very simple reason for that: for years and years, National Party MPs on the New South Wales north coast have been seeking to have the New England Highway declassified as part of the national highways structure in order for the Pacific Highway to be classified as a national highway. What does that mean? That means the Pacific Highway, once it gains national highway status, attracts national highways funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The transport minister is a National Party MP from the New South Wales north coast and, unashamedly, a great supporter for upgrades of the Pacific Highway. I do not have any concern about upgrades of the Pacific Highway; I support them&mdash;but not at the expense of the New England Highway, which stretches through my electorate from Beresfield in the south to Quirindi in the north, and not at the expense of other highways. The minister has demonstrated by his open passion for works on the Pacific Highway during question time this week that I should have legitimate concerns about his appointment. I call upon the minister to restore that national highways funding, so that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the New England Highway can continue to get the funding it enjoyed under the previous Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shadow minister for foreign affairs, the honourable member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith (Mr Brereton), who is at the table, was transport minister in the last Labor government. He contributed $33 million to the Belford Bends project in my electorate&mdash;money that was withdrawn immediately upon the election of the Howard&hyphen;Fischer government. The backdown has come and the funding has been restored, but I call upon the minister to restore the national highways funding. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, I can certainly understand your disappointment with the previous speaker, the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon), particularly since I am aware of the tremendous work that you have done personally throughout your entire time as a member of this House in championing the need to upgrade the Pacific Highway. It is a very important national road and a project that this government has really identified with very strongly since its election. Whilst I do not drive the road as often as you do, the time I spend on it makes it abundantly clear to me that this has been an arterial road of great importance that has been neglected for far too long&mdash;and that should be to the great shame of members opposite.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the government's commitment to increased road expenditure on this particular project is to be commended. It is not at the expense of other roads. I have been delighted with the number of projects that have been approved in my own electorate that are not on the Pacific Highway since this government has come to office. Today I want to speak about a matter that has been debated in the House over recent days. In particular, I want to respond to some comments made by the shadow minister for primary industries which were inaccurate. Firstly, I turn to the expenditure through government bodies of either direct taxpayer funding or moneys collected through industry contributions such as levies.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12208">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday the House considered and approved amendments from another place to the  Australian Meat and Live&hyphen;stock Industry (Repeals and Consequential Provisions) Bill 1997 . Yesterday, in my remarks on behalf of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson), I said that the government was deeply concerned over Labor's effort to remove item 45 from schedule 5&mdash;an item providing that, if staff are offered equivalent employment with the new meat producer company and they refuse that offer, they will be deemed to have resigned and not be entitled to redundancy payments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This item was proposed by the government in order to protect the rights of employees while providing for both an independent decision on equivalence and a right of independent review. It was aimed at protecting industry funds from misallocation. The government reluctantly accepted this amendment to overcome problems of getting this very important package of legislation in place in a timely manner so that existing staff would not face a four-month period of uncertainty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his remarks, the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) was cavalier in his approach; cavalier to the point where I cannot leave his claims unaddressed. He said of this legislation that it was `a nippy little industrial relations stunt'. That remark added nothing whatsoever in terms of credibility for his argument.

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of section 32. Perhaps he failed to consider the Repatriation Institutions (Transfer) Act 1992. He should look at part 4, which deals with certain affected employees who are taken to have resigned. Another example is that of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation (Sale of Assets and Abolition) Act 1990. The honourable member for Burke should have a look at part 15.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the appropriation bills, I would like to remind the people of this parliament that a little under a year ago the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) rose in this House to give a progress report to the people of Australia. If my memory serves me correctly, it was a very short speech. Twelve months later I was not surprised to see that the Prime Minister did not have the front to even approach the dispatch box to give a similar oration this year&mdash;so little has his government been able to achieve and so absolute has its incompetence been.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The disintegration of the Howard government over the last 12 months has been a sight to behold. I would be lying if I said that it did not give those of us on this side of politics some degree of satisfaction. That said, there is nothing that we or the Australian people 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12209"> enjoy in watching the country drift from crisis to crisis, directionless, because of the terrible mismanagement of the present administration. We are all the losers because of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the current government came to power in 1996, this country stood at the crossroads. Over the previous 13 years Australia had grown in a number of leaps and bounds. We were a more confident country, we were a more competitive country, we were a more outward looking and proud country than we had been in 1983. But we still faced a number of challenges in the new millennium. Continuing that good work, taking Australia in the right direction, was a job requiring firm leadership, resolve and intelligence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From the Prime Minister and his team we have had none of the above. As a result, not only has this country been left at the crossroads; it seems to me&mdash;as it seems to a great many Australians&mdash;we are standing in the middle of the road with a semitrailer breathing down our necks. It is an understatement to say that the Australian people are less confident now than they were 12 months ago. In that short period of time we have become divided as a nation, full of discontent and racked with resentment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister and his government may be able to appreciate how to dangle a carrot in front of the Australian people, they may be able to understand how to tap into the dark subconscious of the Australian people, to divide them with poise and expertise, but they do not have, and nor do I see them developing it in the future, an awareness of the Australian psyche, of what makes us all tick. If they did, we would not have seen the savage cuts they have meted out to some of the most disadvantaged groups in this country over the past 20 months of their reign; we would not have seen this government trying to wring money from the sick and frail elderly and harassing them with mountains of legalities via their ill&hyphen;planned nursing home reforms; we would not have seen a Prime Minister so bereft of feeling and goodwill, so hard-hearted, that he could not apologise on behalf of the nation to the legions of Aboriginal children who were stolen from the arms 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and homes of their parents year after year until the early 1970s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a Prime Minister, remember, who publicly chastises Aboriginal leaders for what he considers to be their intemperate language but who still harbours individuals like the Member for Capricornia (Mr Marek)&mdash;our Paul `20 bucks and a packet of Jatz' Marek&mdash;in his ranks without so much as a slap on the wrist. If this government had a true understanding of Australians, we would not be watching hopelessly as the same Prime Minister and his senior colleagues hurtle us towards a double dissolution election based on race, either oblivious to or uncaring of the fact that to do so will turn city against country, black against white and Australian against Australian. To do so will leave a gulf between our country men and women which may be unbridgeable for generations. If they did, we would not be seeing teams of cutthroat mercenaries, skilled in the art of warfare, preparing themselves in a secret training camp in faraway Dubai to take over the nation's waterfront. What bloody and terrible confrontation has this government in store for us? Only time will tell.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fair and the open&hyphen;minded members on the government's back bench know the sort of dramatic juncture Australia finds itself at. The Member for Aston (Mr Nugent), the Member for Kingston (Ms Jeanes) and others like them know, as we do, that presently in this country, whatever level of negligible leadership we do have, we are receiving it without a heart and without a soul. It is doing us severe damage, perhaps irretrievable damage, both inside our borders and in the eyes of our international partners. They know that it is no good attempting to get the economic settings right, that it is no good attempting to look after the general mechanics of policy, if you do not govern with a soul and with an ability to make Australians from all walks of life feel that they live in a fair country, in a principled country and in a moral country. Without these things people cannot walk with their heads held high. They certainly are not going to vote for a government that gave them that cross to bear, no 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12210"> matter what sort of economic figures are dangled in front of their noses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just a few short weeks ago, the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) made a damning admission to a journalist from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>. In answer to the question, `Is this the worst government Australia has ever seen?' the minister replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You're expecting an argument with a proposition like that? You won't get one from me.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Just in case the minister is wondering, he will not get an argument from the people of my electorate either. The last 20 months, as most Australians have seen, has been no picnic for the people of Prospect. The Howard government came to power promising to reduce unemployment. The Prime Minister said, `Give me 12 months before you judge me on my record.' Now, 20 months later, Prime Minister, the Fairfield&hyphen;Liverpool local government area, which I represent and which covers the majority of my electorate, has one of the highest rates of unemployment in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Treasurer (Mr Costello) may crow about the rate of growth that we are finally reaching in this country&mdash;growth rates which, incidentally, we had in government two years ago. However, as long as this growth rate fails to translate into an increase in employment for the people of my electorate&mdash;and, from the figures we have seen, there seems to be no sign of this happening&mdash;very few of them will take solace in any figures the government comes up with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister's failure to attack unemployment in western Sydney&mdash;indeed, his unsurpassed effectiveness in exacerbating it with his massive cuts to employment programs&mdash;is having a number of disturbing knock&hyphen;on effects within my area. Crime and juvenile delinquency, family breakdown and domestic violence and the most serious heroin problem in Australia are all taking a devastating toll on my community, and lying at its heart is the region's endemic and deep unemployment. The Prime Minister offers reactionary, bandaid solutions to these problems. He announces $84 million over three years to combat drugs and $25 million over 3&half; years for domestic violence, yet he fails to appreci 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ate that to really make an impression on these social problems he needs to attack their root causes, including unemployment. Axing $2 billion from labour market programs is quite plainly not the way to go about solving unemployment; neither will fringe feelgood programs like work for the dole have much of an impact on reducing the numbers in the jobless queues. Only good public policy is going to do that and good public policy includes a thorough and encompassing program of labour market reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people of Prospect&mdash;not only those who are unemployed but also their families and their dependents&mdash;say, `We feel like we have been left in the lurch by this government.' My people take no joy in discovering that our Prime Minister, from his fireside armchair at Kirribilli House, feels it unnecessary to lead his government in fighting an all&hyphen;out war to reduce unemployment in this country. If anything, it leaves my constituents feeling abandoned and left behind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the last 20 months the Howard government has also left behind a number of the promises it made while in opposition. The Howard government came to power promising the people of my electorate adequate, affordable and available community based child care. In relation to child care, the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It's the role of the government to facilitate choice. Now, that's the policy, that's the philosophy, the attitude, the approach.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">After cutting $820 million from the community based child&hyphen;care sector around Australia, the only choices this government has left thousands of families is whether they leave their jobs to stay home and look after the kids, whether they call on relatives or friends to mind their children or whether they place their kids in unregulated and unaccredited backyard childminding operations. My electorate has been devastated by the Howard government's cuts to child care. Where two years ago some community based centres in my electorate would have seen around 300 children coming through their doors each week, some of them now find it difficult even to maintain 100 regular attendees. There are, indeed, enough vacancies in the community 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12211"> based centres in my electorate for at least two centres to be closed down. Fees have skyrocketed by up to $40 per child per week at some centres, services have been dropped and expert staff have been sacked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also anecdotal evidence to suggest that many parents in my community are leaving their children with out-of-work young people&mdash;many of whom are not much more than kids themselves&mdash;and who have no childminding expertise or knowledge. They are paying these young people a nominal fee in order to keep their kids under supervision, but who knows what really happens to them in these places while their parents are at work?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Child&hyphen;care funding, however, is not the only thing we have lost in my electorate. We have seen the demise of the highly successful family resource centre, Ettinger House. Ettinger House played an extremely valuable role in coordinating and informing local community groups and individuals to help them find the support services they needed. Now that Ettinger House has been closed down, we have lost a valuable link out of our community's welfare safety net.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have lost a considerable amount of funding from the Fairfield Legal Aid service as well. Fairfield Local Court, not five minutes walk from my electorate office, is one of the busiest courts in New South Wales. As a result, Fairfield Legal Aid is also one of the busiest offices of its kind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can assure the government that its cuts to legal aid have not lessened the work burden on the people in this office. There is no doubt that, because of these cuts, the underprivileged people in my community are not receiving the legal representation that is due to them. If people are going unrepresented, that means people are not getting the justice they deserve. That people in modern day Australia are being deprived of their natural rights&mdash;their natural recourse to justice&mdash;because of cuts by the Howard government is deplorable in the extreme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people of Prospect have also lost Commonwealth funding for public dental health care at the local Fairfield Hospital.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> When Commonwealth funding cut out on 1 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> January this year, Fairfield Hospital's public dental health clinic endeavoured to keep business going as usual. Seven months later, it realised that business as usual without Commonwealth support was simply impossible. The General Manager of the Fairfield Health Service, Mr Andrew Bernard, was forced, on 1 July this year, to suspend the hospital's dental care waiting list, a list which had ballooned considerably since Commonwealth funding was axed, in order to clear the backlog of names that were already there. By 1 July, there were 3,000 patients waiting on the general dental care waiting list and approximately 1,800 patients waiting on the denture waiting list. In the 5&half; months since the lists have been suspended, hospital management has had turn away anybody wishing to receive any kind of dental treatment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So where have the hundreds of people&mdash;most of them elderly pensioners&mdash;who looked to Fairfield Hospital for help with their dental problems gone over the last 5&half; months? Their teeth certainly have not been fixed. They have not been able to do it themselves. These people still need either new dentures or teeth care. They still need fillings or caps; they still need to have their teeth removed. What is happening to them? The answer is very plain. They have not disappeared; they are suffering in silence. The Howard government took $100 million out of this program and has, instead, wasted it on an ineffective private health insurance incentive scheme. Elderly people with rotten teeth in my electorate are eating their meals through straws and will continue to do so for months to come&mdash;and possibly even years into the future&mdash;until those funds taken out by the Howard government are returned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If people require emergency treatment because of their teeth, there is still no guarantee they will receive a prompt consultation. Fairfield Hospital's 24&hyphen;hour emergency dental service is most days anything but. People have to call the clinic in the morning to make an appointment. If they do not get through&mdash;and, believe me, I have been told it is not uncommon for the phones to be engaged for hours at a time; I have also tried myself to get through to test it&mdash;then they must try again 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12212"> the next day or the day after that, and if they are again unsuccessful then the day after that or, indeed, the day after that. You try putting up with an abscess for as long as that!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All the while these people are in excruciating pain, but the hospital does not have the resources to help them because, again, the Howard government has withdrawn them. This government has introduced Third World health values into what should be a First World facility at Fairfield Hospital, leaving both the staff and patients to pick up the pieces. They have just been left with it. I think that is an absolutely woeful state of affairs to have arrived at.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When one talks about the past 20 months under the Howard government, one could not possibly go past without commenting on its complete incapacity to come up with a fair and comprehensible nursing home policy. As the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) said in the House yesterday, we have seen 12 backflips on this policy in the last eight months. You would think that this government&mdash;after 12 backflips, after the fear and anxiety they had whipped up among the elderly and their families in the community, after the bad poll results had started pouring in&mdash;would finally have realised the error of its ways and made a full and unqualified retreat. It has tried to portray itself as having done just that, but the fine print says something different.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Family Services (Mr Warwick Smith) has tried to make it look like the government has rolled over following the public outcry which met its nursing home reforms. But, in reality, the backdown is still only partial. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sick and frail elderly requiring nursing home care, who plan to rent their home for that average price of around $200 a week to get into a nursing home, will still have to pay over $2,500 in tax as well as the government's annual fee for that nursing home of $4,380.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Added to the existing fee of $7,686, this means&mdash;as all and sundry know&mdash;a person will have to pay $14,774 for their nursing home care per year. Faced with coming up with this money, and no&hyphen;one has it, it is pretty clear that the elderly of my electorate of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Prospect will still have to contend with selling their homes to get a bed in a nursing home. The elderly of Australia need to be made aware of this fact. Their home is still not safe under this government. The government's nursing home policy remains unconscionable and unfair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we look back at the issues which I have just raised, it is really no wonder that we did not receive a progress report from the Prime Minister this year. There is simply no progress to report. The Australian people deserve to face the new millennium united, a people with a common voice and a common spirit. We do not deserve to live in a country divided by mean-spiritedness, by jealousy and by despair. Unfortunately, that is the course that this Howard government has set us upon. It is a course which has the Prime Minister's fingerprints all over it. It is a course, I believe, from which any fair-minded Australian should recoil in horror.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the few minutes still left to me, I would like to put on record also my appreciation to the Speaker, to you, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, to the clerks and to all staff who have managed this parliament other the last 12 months. I would like to thank all of the attendants and all those involved in providing the services that we need so desperately to be able to represent our electorates in this place. I would like to wish them all a very merry Christmas and may we have a very happy and prosperous 1998.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to put on record my appreciation to my personal staff&mdash;to Julie Starr, to Brian Thompson and to Paul Andrews. They are three people who work very well within my office. None of us are an island. We cannot do what we do in representing our people and think we can do it by ourselves. All of us depend on our staff. I have always been very dependent on mine. I have a very loyal staff.

I wish everyone concerned all the very best. Let us see that in 1998 we go forward with the calmness and even&hyphen;handedness of which I spoke in this speech. We do not need to divide this nation; we do not need to divide this country. What we need is leadership that will unite us and keep this country going in the right direction.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today, on the appropriation bills, I want to talk about Australia's minerals and resources industries and make some commentary on the state of Australia's great minerals and resources industries&mdash;great industries for Australia by way of investment, by way of exports and by way of jobs. When the private new capital expenditure figures came out, I was interested to hear the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in the House on 27 November lauding the capital investment figures. In the House, he said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12218">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the private new capital expenditure figures released for the September quarter today show very strong investment expectations over the course of the next year.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What the Treasurer did not tell the House&mdash;but which the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans), drew to the House's attention&mdash;was that the private new capital expenditure figures showed a four per cent drop over that quarter. But, despite the four per cent drop, the Treasurer is out there lauding the strong investment expectations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most important aspect of the new capital expenditure figures is the fact that, so far as minerals and resources are concerned, while total business investment fell by four per cent in the September quarter, mining investment rose by 14 per cent. The expectation comment that the ABS put for the September quarter is `expectations for the mining industry are indicating particularly strong growth'. The current estimate for mining investment expectations is 18.7 per cent higher than for the same estimate last year. The investment is there in the minerals and resources industry. It is important to appreciate the link between the state of investment in the industry with the state of exploration activity. We are expecting the next lot of exploration figures to be out before the end of the year. The most recent actual and expected private mineral exploration figures released by the ABS are for the June quarter, which were released at the end of September. It is interesting to try to make some assessment of these figures. The ABS survey for the June quarter says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The upward trend in exploration expenditure since the June quarter 1993 continued in the June quarter 1997.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As the honourable member for Corio (Mr O'Connor), our spokesperson for Northern Australia, who has an interest in these matters, will appreciate, we have seen an upward trend in exploration expenditure since the June quarter of 1993. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Between the March and the June quarters 1997, the trend estimate increased by 7.0% . . . With growth continuing in each quarter during 1996&hyphen;97, the trend estimate for the June quarter 1997 was 20.7% higher than for the June quarter 1996. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The substantive point I want to make will be of interest to the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) because it relates to gold. The ABS report goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The total mineral exploration expenditure for 1996&hyphen;97 financial year was $1,157.0m, an increase of $196.8m (20.5%) from 1995&hyphen;96. Exploration for gold accounted for 62.8% of total expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The report refers to gold expenditure being in the range of 62 to 63 per cent. This point is relevant because this is for the June quarter. In the few days after the end of the June quarter, 3 and 4 July, we saw the RBA decision on the gold sell&hyphen;off and the Treasurer's lamentable comments on that announcement, which effectively destroyed the sentiment for gold in the marketplace. The next set of exploration figures that we will get to look at are potentially very worrying. We have seen an increase in the trend in exploration since the June quarter 1993, but 62 per cent to 63 per cent of that is made up of gold. There is absolutely no doubt now, and I am sure the honourable member for Kalgoorlie will agree, that we are now facing effectively a crisis in Australia's gold industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The gold price as I walked to the chamber was $US285. We have seen in recent days one symbolic US dollar amount for the spot price of gold&mdash;$US300&mdash;breached. Today as I walked into the chamber another symbolic level&mdash;$US285&mdash;was breached. We are seeing enormous difficulties for the gold industry and that will run through into exploration. Despite those strong investment figures we saw released last week for new private capital expenditure, despite that strength in exploration since the June quarter 1993, there is a very serious and grave risk that, as a result of the damage that the Treasurer did to the sentiment for gold, we will see a significant buffeting of those exploration figures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have previously drawn to the attention of the House, so far as gold is concerned, some specific projects that have either chosen not to expand or have effectively closed. Perhaps the two most noteworthy of those are Western Mining's decision not to proceed with its $157 million St Ives project expansion as a direct consequence of gold price difficulties. Most recently we have seen the closure of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12219"> Mount Todd goldmine in the Northern Territory. I was both interested and concerned earlier this week to see a report in the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> of an analysis which suggests that, as a consequence of the slump in the gold price, there is now a forecast that the production of gold in Australia will contract from approximately 300 tonnes a year to 200 tonnes&mdash;a 30 per cent drop in gold output. On Monday's or Tuesday's prices, which were closer to $US300 than $US285, that would come in at a loss of income to the industry in the order of $1.3 to $1.4 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With gold making up 62 to 63 per cent of our exploration we now run the risk of seeing, because of the circumstances relating to gold, up to a 30 per cent drop in production. The consequences which flow will not be adverse for just exploration, they will be adverse for very many regional centres in Western Australia and elsewhere. One thing is not generally understood about the gold industry. Most members have an understanding of the bigger projects and the bigger companies, but this is a very diverse industry. It is situated in towns such as Meekatharra, Cue, Leonora, Laverton and Southern Cross. It is not just the super pits in Kalgoorlie or the large mines like Mount Todd or Telfer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What are some of the other difficulties facing the minerals and resources industry at present? One is the commodity price cycle, which in very many respects is running against us on just about every front. I have mentioned gold; I will not lay that on with a trowel. I will move to nickel. One of the things which buttressed the north&hyphen;eastern goldfields of Western Australia generally when the RBA made its decision and the Treasurer made his lamentable comments about gold was that things were looking very prospective for nickel in July. There are a number of nickel projects on the books or prospective in Western Australia. Unfortunately, since that time we have seen dramatically adverse consequences for the world nickel price. This has largely come about as a consequence of the former Soviet Union effectively flooding the world market with recyclable nickel in the guise of stainless steel. Now 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> nickel is under severe pressure so far as the nickel price is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That lay at the heart of the decision by Dominion Mining recently to announce that the Yakabindie project would effectively be put on hold for a couple of years. I know that the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer), the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) and the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) sought to link that directly to native title. I well know that Dominion have had their native title difficulties, but the reasons articulated by the chairman and managing director of Dominion at the time of that announcement in Perth last week were directly related to the world nickel price and the slump in that market. So the commodity price cycle is running against us, and what is true of nickel is true of coal and a range of other commodities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second general difficulty that minerals and resources face is what we now describe as the `Asian crisis'. I noticed a report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> by Bruce Hextall, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review's</EMPHASIS> resources writer, which was headed `Fight for life as Asian crisis hits resources'. In his article, Mr Hextall made a series of points which I thought were quite relevant, quite prescient and also, from the industry's point of view, very serious factors which need to be considered. Mr Hextall made the point that the commodity price cycle is running against us, and the Asian difficulties will not help that. Secondly, he made the point that much of our export in minerals and resources goes to the Asian area and that the downturn in the Asian economies will not help that. He also made the point that the institutional investors, whilst there has been some rebound in the course of this week, are now effectively walking away from investing in minerals and resources stock. Just as the gold producers and gold miners have found in the last four or five months, there is now a general difficulty in raising capital so far as minerals and resources projects are concerned. The sorts of comments that Mr Hextall made in the course of his article draw some of those strands together and put some of the industry's current difficulties into some context.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12220">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Underlying all of this is the general philosophical approach which now needs to underline our public policy approach to minerals and resources. This goes not just to exploration and investment but to production generally. If I can use the quaint phrase `in the old days', the competition for capital for investment in Australia's minerals and resources industries used to be effectively the choice which was made in boardrooms in Melbourne, Sydney or, to a lesser extent, Perth as to whether you would invest your money into a gold&hyphen;copper mine in New South Wales, a base metals mine in Queensland or gold or, more recently, iron ore in Western Australia. The various state governments would put forward their various incentive packages to try to attract capital to their state for that investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The difficulty for Australia now as a nation state is that that is no longer the competition. The competition for investment capital for minerals and resources is now a global competition. So when the map is unfurled it is not a map of Australia, it is a map of the world, and the decisions which are made in boardrooms in Melbourne, Perth, Sydney, London and the United States are decisions which determine whether investment capital is made in Australia, Canada, the United States, Argentina, Indonesia, India or Brazil.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The great competition for us now is competition for international capital for investment purposes in the minerals and resources area. I frankly think that one thing we have not done at all at the national level is to put the public policy ruler under our attractiveness or international competitiveness for investment in minerals and resources industries. We have to a very large extent, if not to a complete extent, taken for granted the great attractiveness of the industries we have: the world&hyphen;class ore bodies, the great prospecting skills, the great exploration skills, the great engineering ingenuity and the capacity to run the best and most efficient mines in the world.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> policy ruler under the question: what are we doing to make sure we attract international capital for minerals and resources? I will give a couple of examples. If you, like MIM or Norths, want to get the Alumbrera project going in Argentina, you turn up in Argentina and you have a meeting with the President. The President hands over a personally signed copy of the tax regime which says that there is a stable tax regime in place for 30 years, and you make your judgments accordingly. That is one thing which Argentina is doing in seeking to attract capital.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I noticed the other day that Comalco, who are contemplating an expansion of their activities so far as alumina is concerned in Gladstone, were referring to the choice between Gladstone or Malaysia&mdash;which are the two options they have on the books. The point that was made by a representative of Comalco at a conference earlier this week was that they were not so much worrying about the sovereign risk which might come from the PNG Chevron pipeline possibility but the fact that the Malaysians were prepared to ascribe to Comalco's alumina refinery the denomination of `project of national significance', which brings with it, effectively, a 100 per cent development allowance incentive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are the sorts of things that other countries are doing. What are we doing? I think, frankly, that we are resting on our laurels. I make the point about the Alumbrera mine, which is a very good project that displays the world-class skills that our Australian minerals and resources industry has. Whilst the Argentinian regime is a 30&hyphen;year tax freeze, that project only went ahead so far as the Australian consortium was concerned because EFIC, our own export finance institution, put together an international consortium to effect sovereign risk insurance. This is a point I have made previously to the representatives of the minerals and resources and industries: we may well be going through our access to title difficulties, which on this side we are doing our best to seek to resolve, but there is a qualitative difference between having an access to land difficulty and having your assets compulsorily acquired without compensation. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12221">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Deputy Prime Minister stands up in this place and talks about sovereign risk. Sovereign risk is a very important factor, and access is one of the things which goes to the notion of sovereign risk, but one of the great strengths we have&mdash;which is a strength that Argentina and Papua New Guinea do not currently have&mdash;is the notion that there is no risk under our regime of one's assets being acquired without compensation. So when investment is made in Australia one thing you do not need to worry about is sovereign risk insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On those investment and exploration figures, whilst some of the cyclical things are causing difficulty and while there are currently difficulties so far as access to title is concerned, there are great prospects and potential. I think that one of our greatest prospects for Australia is that we now have a much greater capacity than in the past to start to engage much more assiduously in downstream processing. One of the driving factors behind this is the reality and the prospect throughout Australia of much more internationally cost competitive energy with the development of a whole range of new gas production and pipeline projects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Queensland, for example, it is the pipeline from Ballera to Mount Isa and, once you get to Mount Isa, you might just as well go to Gunpowder and, once you get to Gunpowder, you might just as well go to Century Zinc. There is the prospect of the Chevron PNG pipeline. My own view is that that has every likelihood of success. We have seen the heads of agreement between Comalco and Chevron for the joint development of the pipeline and the Comalco refinery in Gladstone and recently we saw the native title access agreement from Gladstone to the end of Cape York. I have no especial knowledge, but I would not be surprised if Chevron representatives were currently floating around the back blocks, making inquiries about sovereign risk insurance so far as PNG is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have always been cautiously optimistic that that project might go ahead simply on the basis that the oil pays for the gas. The gas comes from the Kutubu oil&hyphen;gas field. There is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> too much gas there to reinject, there is too much gas there to flare and there is no domestic market in PNG, so the most sensible thing to do economically and environmentally is to put a pipe over the top of the hill and bring it down to a market. If that goes ahead, you will see that adding to the competitive nature of the cost of energy in Queensland. We are a bit slower off the mark in Western Australia, but we will get there. Bringing down the cost of energy to internationally competitive rates will be that which will drive downstream processing in Australia in future years. So, while there are difficulties currently associated with our great minerals and resources industries, there are great prospects for investment, great prospects for exploration and great prospects for downstream processing. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with great pleasure that I rise to give my wholehearted support to this series of appropriation bills. That pleasure is contained in the appropriation of $10 million for the Commonwealth's Hunter assistance package and a further $1 million for the Hunter Regional Tourism Organisation to assist in the development of tourism in the Hunter region. It is part of a joint cooperative effort by the Howard government, the New South Wales government and BHP to finance projects that will generate longer term economic and employment opportunities in the Hunter. It is a commitment of substantive public funds to bolster the people of the Hunter's confidence, help generate new, exciting business proposals and foster growth and development in related sectors that will, in part, secure employment for existing steelworkers across the Hunter, as well as expand the region's manufacturing mix.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The hard and fast reason for the Commonwealth's $10 million contribution emanates, of course, from the announced closure by BHP of its integrated steel making facility in Newcastle at the end of 1999, resulting in 2,500 direct job losses at the historic steelworks. The collective funding package includes $10 million from the federal government, $10 million from the New South Wales government and an estimated figure of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12222"> at least $5 million committed in kind by BHP. To say that the Hunter assistance package has been well received would be an understatement. Upon its announcement in May, over 50 legitimate applications for financial assistance alone were forwarded collectively to my office and also via Senator John Tierney's to the most competent hands of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, Michael Ronaldson.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The statement of principle by which the Commonwealth wishes to provide support to the Hunter, in the context of BHP's decision to wind back its steel operations, has five criteria. The first is to facilitate access to existing adjustment assistance, particularly labour market measures. This point has been met in part by separate funding assistance on 21 May by former Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Amanda Vanstone, in excess of $2 million, which included extra funding of NEIS places, a skills audit and direct manufacturer&hyphen;worker assistance in retraining and reskilling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point is to provide coordination between existing Commonwealth services and programs having a substantial impact on the Hunter's economy. This coordinated approach includes a review of transport links, investment facilitation and, in particular, a focus on our defence industry, which alone has got to be one of the most exciting things to be happening to the local Hunter economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The defence industry, unbeknown to many, is the biggest employing sector collectively in the Hunter. More to the point, it is an exciting, new age, high&hyphen;tech industry which has the 21st century written all over it. Whether it be for the $850 million lead&hyphen;in fighter project&mdash;in which British Aerospace Australia, in unison with local firm Hunter Aerospace, has made Williamtown the major support facility for this venture&mdash;or naval shipping refits and construction undertaken by the likes of FORGACS and ADI, including the minehunter and frigate modules, or perhaps one day scoring the lion's share of the airborne early warning and control aircraft, the AEWACs, I have issued a call to arms to the Hunter's business, civic and political 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> leaders not to drop the ball on the exciting future prospects that the defence industry has for our region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, the Hunter assistance package would ensure the support of agreed economic development priorities and have the support of all key players. That in itself was played out just yesterday with the announcement of the first round of agreed federal funding totalling $3 million towards the cost of electricity infrastructure on Kooragang Island, provided a feasibility study announced by ANI produces a satisfactory outcome for the construction of a new steel making plant in the Hunter. That figure is being complemented by the state government's commitment of $2 million towards the electricity infrastructure and a grant of $4 million worth of public Crown land to ANI. I will come back to that point in a moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fourthly, the funding is to be provided for key initiatives leading to sustainable employment generation, be it in the private or public sector. That clearly will be the case if ANI proceeds with the proposed 75&hyphen;tonne electric arc furnace, vertical caster and associated equipment to manufacture billets and ingots, at a cost of approximately $125 million. That clearly will be the case as the Commonwealth in due course reveals the rest of its hand in the weeks and months ahead on the rest of its proposed spending commitments allocated within this appropriation bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, the crux of this package includes the monitoring of all other Commonwealth programs that may have an impact on the Hunter. One such initiative is the $1 million allocated to Hunter Tourism for the continuation of their highly successful tourism development strategy. Tourism is an industry that some in the Hunter get a little dismissive of. Tourism is seen by many to be our region's economic panacea, and I have got to say I concur with that sentiment. However, in the same breath many simply do not do recognise the fantastic future that tourism has in the Hunter in terms of the opportunities it provides in future jobs and investment. Tourism in the Hunter is big business, and it delivers significant outcomes for a region which is attempting to re&hyphen;establish itself and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12223"> to cut out a new image, a new direction, in the brave new world of globalised economics for the next century. It delivers substantial numbers of jobs&mdash;the perennial economic question which faces the Hunter's decision makers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tourism in the Hunter now generates one in nine of all new jobs created locally. Recently the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) jointly opened with me the new $2.5 million ecotourism lodge development at the pristine and world renowned Barrington Guest House at the foothills of the Barrington Tops National Park, some of the most intense and exquisite rainforest in Australia. Minister Hill's comments after an overnight stay in one of the new ecotourism cabins was that this was the type of attraction that tourists from all over the world would want to come to in the years ahead. Barrington Guest House, which got into ecotourism decades before it became a buzz word, is very much the way of the future for the tourism industry in the Hunter to exploit sensibly and rationally to create great local economic and employment advantage. Last year $756 million was spent by tourists and visitors coming to the Hunter. That is $756 million that goes through hundreds of small business cash registers: hotels, restaurants and cafes, retail outlets, caravan parks and amusement centres, to name but a few.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Hunter Tourism, who have successfully assisted tourism via their slick, chic advertising and marketing campaign both at home and abroad, have been able to help lure a growth of 35 per cent in the number of foreign tourists to the Hunter in the past four years. They were doing a great job back then, and into the future they will continue to do a great job in being one of the key promoters of the Hunter to the rest of Australia and the world. To put that factor into perspective, for every 18 foreign tourists that come and stay in the Hunter, one new real job in the region is created and, importantly, sustained. The $1 million will have $500,000 allocated for a key infrastructure initiative to foster further growth in tourism, $300,000 for Hunter Tourism marketing and $200,000 for training initiatives. Expressions of interest have now 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> closed and, with the Office of National Tourism, those allocated moneys will be reviewed before their future announcement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of recent times, the Labor Party has made much ado, so to speak, about the fact that the Hunter region has an unemployment rate some four to 4&half; per cent higher than the state or national average. There is no denying that fact. The Hunter needs to do much better on the employment front. It is a problem that grew bigger and bigger in the 1980s. When it was not effectively addressed back then, it bolted out to an incredible 17 per cent plus in official terms during Labor's self&hyphen;induced recession of the early 1990s, and now hovers between 11.5 and 12.5 per cent. There are many reasons for this in the last decade and a half, as there were missed opportunities, including the wind&hyphen;backs and shutdowns of BHP, the old State Dockyards and Carrington Slipways, to name a few.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yes, our regional economy has restructured&mdash;or, more to the point, it was forced to restructure&mdash;and on many fronts business, government and the community are taking up the challenge. But we must be prepared to continue to think outside the square. In recent months I suggested, for instance, that as a region we needed to collectively examine the future operations of our domestic airports, of the reality that the ever continuing expansion of Williamtown Airport had to be put in perspective with the now much smaller air operations at Belmont Aeropelican. In the medium term, I said, the future of Belmont Airport should be put under the microscope and perhaps, in the interest of the Greater Hunter, have its services consolidated at Williamtown. That caused a few rumblings and has caused a fair bit of heated debate, but there are plenty of people, including, for instance, David Simmons from the Newcastle Chamber of Commerce, a respected former Labor member and tourism minister in this parliament, who think it is a damn good idea, with immense downstream benefits for a variety of industries and with the ability to bolster freight movements out of the Hunter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point I was trying to make with all that is that we must be prepared to be a little bit different; to be a little, should I say, like 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12224"> Jeffrey Kennett and have the intestinal fortitude to say that we want the Hunter to go forward. That is the symbolism behind this Commonwealth assistance package to the Hunter. Just as BHP says goodbye to steel making in Newcastle at the turn of the century, I very much predict that new industries, new exciting businesses, will rise like a phoenix from these ashes. Put simply, the sky is not going to fall in on the Hunter&mdash;indeed, I am so bold as to predict that it could even be a new dawn. Of course the future closure of BHP's steel making facility will, in raw numbers, further increase the percentage unemployment rate, but the Howard-Fischer government is not about to let that happen. It would have been easy for the Howard government to abandon me as the occupant of the Liberal Party's most marginal seat in this House and just say, `Well, for the cost for one seat, it is not worth the investment.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, this government is not like that. And this has nothing to do with the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) particularly wanting to keep Bob Baldwin in parliament. This is about a belief in the people of the Hunter. This is about caring for people as individuals and not treating them as disposal statistics, as Labor has historically tended to do in the Hunter. This debate today is about an investment in the people of the Hunter. It is about developing a plan that can and will work, despite the protestations of others from across the political divide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The substantial upgrading of electricity infrastructure on Kooragang Island as part of the first round of the Commonwealth's promised assistance package to the Hunter paints a very real picture that job creation and fostering new industry development in our region remain a clear focus. Both I and Senator John Tierney, the Howard government's other representative in the Hunter, have played active behind the scenes roles to promote jobs and investment friendly projects that economically reposition the Hunter for the 21st century. Together we applauded yesterday's funding assistance for upgraded electricity infrastructure on Kooragang Island, seen as the precursor to ANI constructing its new steel operations.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To attract further industry to the Hunter and to best utilise the untapped resource that Kooragang Island is for the local economy, we need to ensure that adequate infrastructure is in place. Being fair dinkum about ensuring that steel making is not lost to the Hunter and about expanding the region's tentacles to attract new industry means that simple things like getting the infrastructure nuts and bolts in place have to be a priority. Opening the door for new industry development, expanded investment and job creation on Kooragang Island will mean that what many have seen as an industrial lemon will become very sweet tasting in terms of the economic benefits it will deliver.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Overall, Kooragang Island, with its direct access to the port of Newcastle, to the adjacent rail services and to the nearby air services at Williamtown, makes plenty of economic sense if the Hunter's industry base is to continue to expand and reinvent itself. For the Commonwealth to ensure long&hyphen;term job sustainability and new employment opportunities for our youth and for displaced BHP employees, we have to show Australia and the world that on every level the Hunter is an attractive place for industry to cost effectively set up shop. Yesterday's announcement shows that. And it is a case of `watch this space' for what is in store to round out the rest of the Commonwealth's $10 million plus investment. After all, this is about repositioning the Hunter and about government planting the seed for private industry to overcome BHP's cessation of steel making in the region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I wish to address what, after intensive lobbying by me, Senator Tierney and other interested parties keen to see the Hunter hurtling forward economically, is the issue of the government's long awaited industry statement. The Labor Party have, as I have picked up from time to time, tried to draw a line in the sand. They try to say that industry policy is off the rails and that this government is visionless when it comes to industry policy. I will take that a step further. The member for Hotham (Mr Crean) is trying to downplay manufacturing in bond. In today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Newcastle Herald</EMPHASIS>, he says that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12225">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . got to do it. He's got to announce MIB, but I fear that it will be the only announcement of benefit to Newcastle. What they'll try and do is say they've sorted Newcastle out by giving them Manufacturing in Bond.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Bless my cotton socks, Simon: if we deliver manufacturing in bond, we may just do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the people of the Hunter, I have been taking up a last&hyphen;ditch fight to see that this region is a direct beneficiary of a new approach to industry and a fresh approach to manufacturing. Pressing all the buttons means trying to ensure that the Commonwealth government approves foreign trade zones or, in just as practical terms, a manufacturing in bond arrangement for the Hunter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Such a policy announcement will back to the hilt revelations by firms such as DHL Worldwide, planet earth's largest air freight distributor, that a change in the federal tax and duty structure by this government could bring a windfall of investment at Williamtown airport by way of an Asian warehouse headquarters for the corporate giant. When I recently launched Elite Distribution Services' new $1.2 million headquarters in October, which is now the Hunter's largest transport distributor, its heightened support for any such change in the reapplication of taxes and duties on exported goods as a way to value add and boost local manufacturing could have it playing a greatly expanded role, as could BHP with its Steel River project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An endorsement of manufacturing in bond was recommended by the Steel Industry Inquiry Committee, of which I was a member, and featured as part of the government's response to the Mortimer report. To endorse manufacturing in bond will very much assist the exciting developments at Williamtown airport, consolidating it as an avionics and aeronautical hub.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is one of the key visions I have had for the Hunter since my election to this House. A simple nip and tuck to change the federal tax policy and reinstate a policy which the Hawke government dropped like a hot potato in 1987 could bring DHL and its massive resource base to the Hunter. All that is needed is a simple nip and tuck to remove 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> restrictions on the use of section 79(3) of the Customs Act to allow a warehouse licence to authorise blending, packaging, processing, trading or other specified activities. That might not be exciting but it would mean federal tax policy could deliver real job and investment outcomes almost in an instant in the Hunter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That measure would not just be for DHL to exploit. The success and growth of Elite Express as regional agents for Australia's major distribution firms, including Ansett Air Freight, AUSDOC and Australian Pharmaceutical Industries proves the Hunter has an exciting future that expands far beyond being a steel region in the eyes of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, when I speak of vision, you will not find more bucket loads of it than in a speech by Chris Huggins, group general manager of A Goninan and Co. during a speech to an industrial relations seminar at Salamander Bay on 31 October. He reflected on industry policy, and I do not think anyone could put it much more eloquently than he did:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">How can it be that a nation so young, focussing itself towards international competitiveness and approaching the inevitability of becoming a republic, has no clear notion of what our national interest really is, for example, in manufacturing and employment generation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Would any management team steer their company into a new market without a clear understanding of the factors affecting that market and how the company's strategy would impact on its workforce and shareholders?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fact is that industry must invest to survive and government must provide leadership to facilitate and support this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Hunter's regional economy is increasingly integrated with global markets for its resources, manufactures and services, and I invite you to contemplate the potential of a "new platform" for export&hyphen;orientated activities that could be triggered, such as the Made in Bond zone.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Chris Huggins is spot on the mark.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think Chris Huggins will be impressed with next Monday's long awaited industry statement. Hunter industry has a great spokesman and a great lateral thinker in Chris Huggins. Let me tell you, this government has 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12226"> done some thinking on this subject, and the thinking it has done is pretty lateral.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to these appropriation bills, I think I ought to make it quite clear that the problems facing Australia are not guns, drugs, sex&mdash;or rock and roll, for that matter. The abiding cancer eating at this nation is the high level of unemployment and the fact that governments no longer take the people of Australia into their confidence. Because the policies of Liberal and Labor are so similar, the people of Australia are disenfranchised and are no longer party to the government. The problem of unemployment is recognised by the many previous members who have spoken, but they do not seem to understand that their own policies, the policies of their respective parties, have contributed to this problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his very worthwhile contribution, the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) talked about the problems he has experienced with industrial relations. There is absolutely no doubt about that, if we go down the road the government is proposing, we advantage multinational companies to the disadvantage of workers in Australia. Frankly, I do not think the multinational companies need this sort of advantage, for one thing is sure: these large companies never, ever operate with Australia's national interest as a priority. It may be a by&hyphen;product of their actions, but their actions are always in their own perceived interests. If we benefit, we are simply fortunate in that regard. The enormous advantage which the banning of secondary boycotts bestows on multinational companies has to be considered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) spoke very forcefully in this debate lamenting unemployment, particularly in the western suburbs. A job created anywhere in Australia has the impact of stopping people from one place moving to another. I am very keen to see jobs created in the western suburbs of Sydney or Melbourne&mdash;or anywhere else in Australia, for that matter&mdash;because it simply 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> stops those people coming to my electorate and looking for work. It was under the former Prime Minister, Paul Keating, that this nation was effectively deskilled. Paul Keating told caucus that the future lay in the service sector. The service sector is political code for tourism. As you would know yourself, Mr Deputy Speaker, when jobs were destroyed in the Tasmanian timber industry those people did not find jobs in the tourist industry. When the tourist industry got off the ground, that in turn was attacked by the Greens. Across Australia we have a situation where workers are being made unemployed, their wives now work part time and no&hyphen;one factors in the cost to society of the kids who are out of control.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the real issue for Australia, but it is not being addressed by the government. We have to reskill this country. This country, which arguably used to make the best metal trades workers in world, now produces drink waiters. They may be very good drink waiters. The member for Prospect indicated in her speech that she thinks the future lies in tourism. I can tell the comrade from Prospect that it is not so. Tourism is a very good ancillary industry, it is one we want, but it has to be an ancillary industry because expenditure on tourism is highly discretionary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) talked about mineral development. Yes, there was an upturn in mineral development last year. What he failed to mention was that it was very largely brownfields development&mdash;development around existing mines. Drilling and exploration outside that type of development is, in fact, tapering off quite considerably. The member for Perth is absolutely right when he points to the downturn in gold. Gold is a very substantial part of that exploration program. Goldmining has taken a terrible knock because of the stupidity of the Reserve Bank in selling our reserves. The justification was that it was being done by banks in Europe. Not one bank in Europe is involved in a goldmining industry. Their parameters are much different from ours. Gold is Australia's second largest industry, but the Reserve Bank effectively acted to damage that industry. The asinine comments of the Treasurer (Mr Costello), which now are a matter of record, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12227"> simply made it worse. The truth is that gold is going through a very bad price downturn, but the companies are pretty well hedged. The companies can probably weather that downturn in price for two years, particularly if it is matched by a declining Australian dollar. The industry did not need the additional burden placed on it by the stupidity of the Reserve Bank and the Treasurer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the member for Perth made too light of the impact of native title on exploration. Native title quite clearly is a real risk to sovereign rights. There is absolutely no doubt that native title is playing its part in stopping mining exploration in Australia. It is very easy for people from Sydney or Melbourne to take the high moral ground. But destroying rural Australia will eventually impact on those cities. That impact is likely to take effect very quickly. For instance, the goldmining industry probably generates more jobs in the cities than any other sector of the mining industry. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are manufacturing jobs, basically in Melbourne and Sydney. Those members from Melbourne and Sydney who come into this House should reflect on that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to read an article which I think is germane. It deals with the myth of an American free press. There is no doubt that what is true in America is absolutely true in Australia. This was said by John Swinton, Chief of Staff of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New York Times</EMPHASIS>, considered by his peers to be the dean of his profession, when asked to give a toast at the New York Press Club in 1953:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no such thing, at this date of the world's history, in America, as an independent press. You know it and I know it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is not one of you who dares to write your honest opinions, and if you did you know beforehand that it would never appear in print. I am paid weekly for keeping my honest opinion out of the paper I am connected with. Others of you are paid similar salaries for similar things, and any of you who would be so foolish as to write honest opinion would be out on the streets looking for another job. If I allowed my honest opinions to appear in one issue of my paper, before twenty&hyphen;four hours my occupation would be gone.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The business of the journalists is to destroy the truth, to lie outright, to pervert, to vilify, to fawn at the feet of mammon, and to sell his country and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> his race for his daily bread. You know it and I know it, and what folly is this toasting an independent press?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are the tools and vassals of rich men behind the scenes. We are the jumping jacks, they pull the strings and we dance. Our talents, our possibilities and our lives are all the property of other men. We are intellectual prostitutes.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That very honest summation of the American press is absolutely true of Australia. There is no doubt that with its greater variety of ownership, the American press is much freer than the press in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This brings me to what I consider to be the absolutely irresponsible behaviour of the press with respect to the reporting of the Wik debate. There is absolutely no doubt that this weak and wishy-washy legislation of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) does not go anywhere near as far as Keating thought his legislation went. Keating was adamant that pastoral leases extinguished native title. Indeed, in the act of 1993 they went to the trouble of making valid those leases which would otherwise have been invalid, thus extinguishing native title on them. Keating also thought there was a prima facie requirement in his act for them to show a real, long-term association with the land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the early days, a tribunal was enforcing that. In my own area&mdash;an area of Australia where there are more native title claims than anywhere else in Australia, where miners have to put up with up to a dozen overlapping claims&mdash;the tribunal was actually rejecting claims because they were without merit or had insufficient evidence. Then we had the Federal Court intervening and saying that, because it was in the preamble of the act&mdash;a very badly written act&mdash;or not in the act itself, it was not part of the act and the court was free to accept claims but not reject them. It was because of that decision, from that point onwards, that the right to negotiate became the right to extortion. Yet, you find the Labor Party here will not maintain that situation and will talk about the value of association with the land, which is basically impossible to prove or to disprove. It clearly means there will be ongoing confusion&mdash;confusion for ever and ever. It is so obvious what it means to oppose a sunset clause&mdash;as 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12228"> they do. It means that future native title claims will be contingent upon the findings of ore bodies, as though there is some mechanism there that triggers it. Of course, there is a mechanism that does trigger it, and that mechanism is unabashed greed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people of Australia ought to know this; they ought to have an understanding of it. But they do not because the media of this country has been so intent on railroading the government, condemning the government. The one&hyphen;sided reporting and the lack of understanding we have had from the journalists of this country are an indictment of the level of journalism in Australia. They should bear in mind the words of that great journalist who said `the bubble is blown and the bubble is pricked by you and such as you'. They have an enormous responsibility. To date, they have not accepted that responsibility. I see very little evidence in the press gallery in this place of any sign or sense of integrity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now want to talk about trade opportunities. We are obviously going to be in for difficult times with the downturn in Asia. This will be compounded because, for years and years, we had a government that pretended Europe did not exist. It was so locked into making us part of Asia that it forgot about Europe&mdash;an area with enormous opportunity, with very high per capita earnings and a culture which, very often, because of its similarity to ours, wants our products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe we must quickly look to Europe for trade opportunities. That is not to say that we should miss other opportunities. I believe there is an enormous opportunity opening up in Liberia&mdash;a country absolutely wrecked and wracked by war; a country now absolutely poverty stricken. If Australia were to get in there now with, say, a flour mill, I believe there are opportunities for us to lock them in to purchase of our wheat for perhaps 25 years. I believe that Liberia could be set up as a flour producing area. It would quickly become the source of supply to surrounding countries. The capital costs of doing this are very small; the opportunities are great. There are also many other opportunities in that part of the world which no-one in government seems to be looking at.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The situation in North Korea is similar. North Korea, with the impending change of government in South Korea, is going to come back into the wider economy. I believe the opportunities are enormous. I believe Australia was very wise to recognise South Vietnam early, and I think we have done proportionately better than most other countries with South Vietnam. The opportunities in North Korea are even bigger. I believe the government should make entry into North Korea a real priority. It is something that I believe, because of the nature of that government, will not happen without government intervention or government support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The truth is that unless we get a manufacturing industry going in this country again there will be no jobs for our kids; there will be no end to the current account deficit. We have seen the manufacturing industry destroyed under the Keating government, and it has to be recreated. We have to start retraining those people. This was sacrificed on the altar of free trade. Free trade rose out of the machinations of this theory of economic rationalism. It should be clearly understood that economic rationalism is not an economic theory but a political ideology; it is the ideology of big business&mdash;mainly American big business&mdash;to control world trade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did not actually say that; it was said by Bob Santamaria, but he is absolutely right. That is what he is about. I am about fair trade. Free trade is a nonsense. I am a great advocate of fair trade, and I believe that, as a fair trader of the world, we have enormous opportunity, but it is an opportunity that will not be able to be developed without vision and support from government. As I say, in some of these countries you are going to need a degree of government to government initiatives to pave the way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In looking at the problems that beset Australia, unemployment is clearly a big one. I said earlier that the lack of confidence that people have in government is very destabilising. I believe that, if we were to adopt citizen initiated referenda as a policy, we could restore that confidence. People would have some confidence in the government if, at the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12229"> end of the day, they could say no and have some control.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The High Court of Australia used to be subject to appeals to the Privy Council, and it was without doubt the best appellate court in the world. We removed that right of appeal to the Privy Council and within a very short time the High Court of Australia became a bunch of social engineers. I make no bones about it: the original Mabo decision was a social engineering decision and not one based on law&mdash;certainly not good law. I believe we need something like citizen initiated referenda to put some power, some control, some intellectual rigour not only into government but also into bureaucracy and the High Court of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">CIR as proposed by us&mdash;the policy has been put forward by Australia First&mdash;would operate in such a way that, if someone could get two per cent of the people across Australia to agree to a certain petition being put to a referendum, the government of the day would be duty bound to include that with the next election. The cost would be absolutely minimal. If that were carried by a constitutional majority&mdash;that is, the majority of people in the majority of states&mdash;it would then be incumbent upon the government to make that law. That is the only change we require to the constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The concept of CIR was in the first draft of our constitution. It was taken out when politicians thought they would keep this power for themselves. The truth is that I as a politician have no more power than the general public. Power resides with the executive government. We would like to seek an amendment to the constitution&mdash;the only amendment we require. It will do far more to keep our constitution up to date than the $30 million constitutional dog's breakfast that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is promoting. Australia could become a republic under CIR, but it could happen only if the majority of people in the majority of states wanted it to happen. It could not be foisted on them, as is likely to happen under the present process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a very reasonable, rational, sensible, economical way of returning power to the people. I believe it should be done. It was the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> policy of the Labor Party from 1907 until 1964&mdash;brought in by Billy Hughes and taken out by Donny Dunstan. We in Australia First believe that it will return power to the people in a real and positive way, and we certainly endorse it. It is interesting to note CIR are supported by some members of the government. I know that the member for Flinders (Mr Reith) was a great advocate of them. I think he was called off&mdash;probably at the behest of the National Party, who really never understood the concept.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is said by some that CIR would lead to the tyranny of the majority. I see no evidence of that, because Australia is probably the fairest society in the world and I think the Australian public can be relied upon to make good judgments. But I say to those academics and those people who say they fear this that there is something worse, in my view, than the tyranny of the majority, and that is what we have had in Australia in recent times: the tyranny of the minority. I think that has to be taken into consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Returning power to the people through CIR and doing something about employment is what this country needs. It we can achieve those things, there will be some new respect in the community for parliament. Parliament will deserve that respect. Under the present system it does not, for the reality is this: people do not exist in a democratic system today. What they have is an elected dictatorship, where people vote in the government and the government takes not a blind bit of notice of them. In my view, this simply is not good enough. We need a system whereby policies can be checked by the people. I believe the combined wisdom of the Australian people will inevitably lead to good decision making. There may be the odd mistake, but overwhelmingly I trust the Australian people and I believe their judgment will be profoundly better than we have had from government in recent years.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Since becoming Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Family Services in July, I have not had as many opportunities to speak in the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12230"> House as I did in the past. So I do welcome this opportunity to join the debate on the appropriation bills. In doing so, I begin by saying it is an honour to be working in the health area with specific responsibilities that impact and have real influence on people's lives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we head towards the end of this parliamentary sitting year, it is an appropriate time to highlight to the House and to my constituents a range of achievements that the Howard government can justly be proud of. On coming to office this government was faced with an enormous challenge to rebuild and restore the nation's fractured economy. Strong and decisive action was required. Having been given the opportunity by the Australian people to govern, this government has ensured that, for the first time in a decade, we no longer operate with a credit card style budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, under the directions of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Treasurer (Mr Costello), we will be repaying over $5 billion in debt and have turned a $10 billion budget deficit into a surplus, giving the Reserve Bank the impetus to allow for five cuts in interest rates. One of the many achievements this government can be proud of is that interest rates are, at 6.5 per cent, the lowest in more than 30 years. As the Treasurer so enthusiastically stated earlier this year, home loan rates are the lowest since man stepped on the moon. He could have easily added that they are the lowest since the Beatles came to Adelaide. This is positive news for the many home owners in the electorate of Adelaide with families who, since the coalition came to government, are now saving on average $333 a month on a $100,000 mortgage&mdash;a far cry from when home loan interest rates reached 17 per cent and small business loans peaked at 22 per cent under the Hawke-Keating government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members might be interested to know that the hardworking taxpayers are paying $9,400 million in interest on the Beazley-Keating debt each year and that figure doubled in the last five years that Labor was in government. By the year 2000, this government will have halved that&mdash;and I take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister for Finance and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Administration (Mr Fahey) on his efforts in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I very much appreciate hearing from the large number of hardworking small business operators that things are beginning to look brighter in their area. This can only be good news for Adelaide. I am taking the opportunity as often as I can to communicate this good news to the wider community because I know that good news leads to confidence and therefore more jobs, which is good news for our young people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased that the elderly members of our community will face Christmas reassured that we have listened to their concerns on our aged care policy. This issue has received a lot of attention in the parliament, the media and the wider community. This is not such a bad thing, however, because for the first time in a long time a government is prepared to address this most crucial issue of nursing home accommodation standards. In a speech I gave in the parliament in June 1994 after the release of the Gregory report, which of course was commissioned by the previous government, I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This report by Professor Bob Gregory . . . reveals the crisis facing Australia's nursing homes, which look predominantly after the frail aged . . . There is a need for a substantial improvement in nursing home buildings, but because of the government funding formula there is a lack of incentive to maintain a good quality of nursing home stock.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I am also on the record while in opposition of reminding the then government of the findings of the Economic Planning Advisory Council's report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia's ageing society</EMPHASIS> , when it stated that the number of aged people will rise from 1.9 million in 1991 to more than five million by the year 2051 when more than one person in five will be over the age of 65 and that adequate government resources would be required to address this situation. Again the then Labor government chose to ignore yet another serious report calling for government action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The main aim of the changes made by the Howard government is to ensure sufficient money is in the system to provide quality care for those five per cent of us who will end up needing nursing home care. The recent announcement by the Prime Minister will relieve 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12231"> genuine concerns in the community while, at the same time, ensuring that more money is available to improve the standard of our nursing homes. A fair and reasonable contribution is being sought from those who can afford to make that contribution. The accommodation bond has been scrapped, a decision which guarantees that no-one will be forced to sell the family home to enter a nursing home. As the government has said all along, access to nursing homes will be based on the need for care, not capacity to pay. Places will continue to be set aside for people who cannot pay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When a family member enters a nursing home it is a stressful time for the whole family. Improving accommodation where necessary is important. As has been put to me recently in my own electorate, why should someone leave the comfort of their own home to spend the last months of their life and to die in a dormitory? I again pay tribute to those providers in my own electorate who do provide quality care in their hostels and nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To say that I am disappointed at the scare campaign undertaken by the members opposite is an understatement; yet this is a party who, when in government, turned its back on our elderly. The Australian Labor Party forced many senior members of our community to endure substandard accommodation and was a government that in its final years actually reduced the level of capital funding by a staggering 75 per cent. For a party that preaches access and equity, this is nothing short of disgraceful. The amount of distress and anxiety Labor has caused to many of the residents of my electorate is unacceptable. Labor has offered no solutions, other than raising taxes to fund extravagant claims. I remind the people of Adelaide that Labor will do and say anything to be elected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a member of this Howard government, I will continue to work hard to ensure that the needs of our elderly remain a high priority. The government is continuing to consult and listen to older people, their carers and families, the aged care industry and the broader community. I have spoken with a number of people over the last 12 months on this issue, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and I will continue to pass on to the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) the concerns of the people in my electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In health care the Howard government is again leading the way with its reform agenda. From 1 July this year low and middle income Australians have received financial incentives to encourage them to take out private health insurance. The program is designed to provide families with a $450 incentive, couples with a $250 incentive and individuals with a $125 incentive. As we all saw last week, the number of people registered as having taken out private health insurance has risen for the first time in seven years. It is to be hoped that that trend continues. We now have a government that encourages both the private and the public sectors to work side by side and recognises how one is interdependent on the other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently the Prime Minister took up the challenge to tackle one of the biggest killers of Australia's young people&mdash;drugs. It is an issue which for too long has been swept under the carpet. The coalition has an integrated plan to get tough on drugs. The Prime Minister has committed some $87 million over three years, with the emphasis on working with state governments, parents, teachers, health professionals, and volunteer and community organisations to combat this antisocial and harmful activity. The government has committed some $43 million on intercepting illicit drugs and the remaining funds are to be allocated to school education, rehabilitation and research. I reassure the many concerned parents and young people in my electorate that this government is determined to put an end to the drug couriers who are responsible for the deaths and harmful destruction of lives of our nation's youth. My office has received a number of congratulatory calls to the government for tackling this serious issue head on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind the House of the excitement of the day the Telstra shares were floated on the stock exchange&mdash;I again congratulate the Minister for Finance and Administration for the great hand, steady influence and great management he has displayed in this area&mdash; 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12232"> resulting from the one-third sale of the nation's telecommunications giant; another election promise delivered. With many Adelaide mums and dads purchasing shares for the first time in their lives, I am sure they are more than pleased with how Telstra is performing to date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can vividly recall the protests from the members opposite and their latest recruit, Cheryl Kernot, about how the selling of this particular government instrumentality was the end of the world, despite the fact that Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank were sold by Labor when they said that they would not be sold. This act of hypocrisy is well known amongst the people of Adelaide. Ninety-two per cent of Telstra's work force have taken up their employee share options; 1.1 million Australians have invested their hard-earned savings in an Australian company that has grown and will continue to grow. Labor have once again shown themselves to be out of touch with the people of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other side of the coin is the positive capital investment in our nation's precious environment through the $1.1 billion Natural Heritage Trust. In the electorate of Adelaide projects under way include `the scrub' Aboriginal food plant trail at Kilkenny and the revegetation of the River Torrens riparian sites.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The state of South Australia will benefit greatly from the trust. In June of last year when I spoke on the Natural Heritage Trust Fund Bill , I highlighted many projects that were to commence. One of the major projects is the Murray-Darling 2001 initiative. This project has some $300 million in funding set aside to deliver major benefits in water quality and quantity provided to South Australia from the Murray&hyphen;Darling river system. As the driest state in the driest continent on earth, and as the state which relies on the Murray River for significant agricultural production and most of the drinking water for its large urban areas, including Adelaide, this project is absolutely essential.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another vital area being addressed is the condition of our coastal and marine environments&mdash;85 per cent of Australia's population live on the coastline. The coast and clean seas 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> initiative, with a commitment of $100 million over four years, will greatly assist in tackling the difficult environmental problems facing South Australia's coasts and seas. Ocean outfalls such as the discharge of secondary treated sewage effluent from Adelaide's treatment works and its subsequent impact on the seagrass must be addressed. I would like to take this opportunity to remind the House of what Dr John Cole, Chief Executive Officer of the Environment Management Industry Association of Australia has said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Money, not good intentions and high rhetoric, is what is required to protect and improve our environmental resource . . . we have the scientific and technological answers, but environmental solutions cost money and the Natural Heritage Trust will provide significant amounts of money for environment investment.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is time for real action on the environment to match real concern. The coalition government is committed to ensuring a viable and sustainable environment for our future generations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Turning to the subject of Wik, I noted the comments of the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell). He said that the 10-point plan put forward by the Prime Minister was not enough and was not as strong as that put forward by the previous Keating government. His statements highlight the complex issues surrounding the government's  Native Title Amendment Bill , which is so little understood but so important. The uncertainty surrounding native title is hurting all Australians no matter what their ethnic background. Reconciliation with indigenous Australians is important. The sooner certainty is achieved, and with the best will, the sooner true reconciliation can take place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite large amounts of money being spent, the happiness, health and education of indigenous Australians are not being progressed as they should be. I have learnt from my experience in dealing with Aboriginal health and education issues that reform does not happen in a single moment or with a single gesture. It only comes with long&hyphen;term commitments aimed at practical reform and guided by a keen sense of fairness and equity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After years of platitudes, ministerial statements and policies by the Hawke and Keating 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12233"> governments, the health and education of Australia's indigenous people showed no sign of improvement. The symbolism of Keating's efforts in the areas of reconciliation would have been far more credible and genuine if they had been substantiated, for example, with initiatives in rural and remote Aboriginal health that achieved real results.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those who work and live on the land have attachments to it which are not well understood by others. Certainty for indigenous and non-indigenous Australians is important and, despite all the difficulties and complexities, cannot be run away from. The Prime Minister has personally consulted and negotiated with key groups for a fair position which while providing for certainty also seeks to achieve a workable framework for sharing and managing land into the future. Such agreements, and the mutual respect and goodwill required to achieve them, are examples of practical reconciliation at work. As the Prime Minister has said, with the passing of this legislation there can still be claims on 79 per cent of the land mass of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Land management, certainty, fairness and reconciliation are all issues to be worked on in a responsible manner. Some overly political or heated statements which have been made have not been helpful. I challenge those who know their local federal member to think about whether that person deserves the description of `racist scum'. Equally, I cannot support those who have made personal attacks on church leaders, but I do hope that church leaders consider all their flock and so work towards greater understanding of all the complexities surrounding the issues of native title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last week, along with my colleague the Parliamentary Secretary for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Ronaldson), I announced funding worth $1,110 million under the federal government's rail reform transition program for select projects based in South Australia. The rail reform transition program was established to help local economies adjust to the changes brought about as a result of the government's rail reform program. As someone who has been involved from the beginning as a member of the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cabinet subcommittee working on rail reform, this was an exciting stage to have reached. I pay tribute to the excellent work done by the member for Hume (Mr Sharp), the former Minister for Transport and Regional Development, in achieving some very satisfactory results in rail reform and the sale of Australian National. The reforms are important for Adelaide and for South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The announcement of the funding was at the headquarters of Overseas Pharmaceutical Aid for Life, in Ridleyton. OPAL was awarded $200,000 to further develop a unique service for collecting and disposing of unwanted medicines. OPAL also distributes pharmaceuticals to lesser developed countries. This is a very worthwhile project. It will create much needed jobs, ensures an environmentally safe way of disposing of unwanted medicines, and promotes the safe removal of unwanted medicines from the home as well as coordinating donations of essential pharmaceutical products to underdeveloped countries. As the local member, I am naturally pleased with projects which promote employment in the north-west suburbs of Adelaide. As Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Family Services, I was delighted that the safe collection and disposal of unwanted medicines was promoted, especially during National Medicines Week, another successful government initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Two other companies received grants. Glen Ewin Fine Foods received $460,000 as a federal government contribution towards the establishment of new processing, packaging and warehouse facilities, which is expected to employ 16 people when complete. TAB Australia Pty Ltd received $450,000 to establish a facility in the electorate of my colleague the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) to manufacture sheep derived antibodies for the treatment of human diseases and other conditions such as snake and spider bites. In all, 160 long&hyphen;term sustainable jobs will have been created by the year 2000. These initiatives are a further demonstration of the federal government's commitment to addressing the adjustment needs of regional communities in Australia. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12234">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Very briefly, I would like to speak about some of the areas for which I have responsibility as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Family Services. One of those&mdash;and it is a key one&mdash;is the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, which is growing at what has been described as a self&hyphen;destructible rate if it is not kept in check. Changes made in the last budget were not slash and burn. Even with the savings, which will be approximately $500 million over four years, the scheme will still grow at $200 million per year. It is worth noting what the opposition has had to say about this and what the shadow minister said back in 1990. The opposition are criticising the TGP initiative now but in 1990 they said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important to remember that four years ago this country allocated $500m from taxpayers' money to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. In the last financial year the allocation was more than $1 billion; in three years' time it will be more than $2 billion. And one can imagine how much we will be spending on subsidising the cost of drugs for our community by the turn of the century&mdash;a massive sum of money, if there is no change in the meantime.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I have said, there has been a massive growth in the cost of pharmaceuticals, so the Government has had to take some action.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And the current shadow minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Doctors should be trained to prescribe a family of drugs and not a particular brand.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We have taken that advice and looked at these issues very carefully and I am pleased to say that, having consulted widely with very well&hyphen;qualified independent experts, we have come up with a very good formula which is going to keep the PBS safe. There will be significant savings. The price premiums are 71c to $4.63, which is a long way from the horror stories which were told. Only four drugs will cost more than $3 and, more importantly, only 1.5 per cent of the 1,800 drugs listed on the PBS will have any premium at all. This has largely been achieved by the competitive pricing which has been put forward by the drug companies when they have been invited to take a competitive approach to this.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R425">Charter of Budget Honesty Bill 1996</XREF>  is a major structural reform of the way in which this country presents and runs its fiscal policy. The bill fulfils an election promise by this government to make sure that the Australian accounts are presented in a fair and honest manner and to enshrine in legislation a requirement which will govern our government and any future government as to the way in which it will present and improve its financial performance. This is the kind of reform which, when enacted, will be a permanent feature, making sure that Australia's economic policy is run better, making sure that the public is kept better informed and making sure that there is transparency in economic policy in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the same bill that was introduced into the House of Representatives on 11 December 1996 and passed by the House of Representatives on 10 February 1997. On 28 October 1997, the Senate passed the bill with 10 amendments. These amendments were unnecessary and made aspects of the bill unworkable. A number of the amendments related to the arrangements for costing election policies during the caretaker period. They would have made the process non&hyphen;transparent by allowing the costing of unannounced policies. They would also risk turning the bureaucracy into a research centre for the opposition, inconsistent with the conventions of Westminster government.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12235">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another amendment sought by the Senate required a detailed report on threats to the tax system and specific means necessary to counter these threats. This would have drawn attention of tax planners to the opportunities for tax avoidance, risking larger revenue losses than would otherwise be the case. Other amendments to the charter unnecessarily complicated the operation of the bill. The amendments were a stunt. If the Labor Party, in particular, had been interested in a charter of budget honesty, it could have introduced such a bill in any one of its 13 years of government. The amendments were not agreed to by the House of Representatives&mdash;and they will not be agreed to by the House of Representatives&mdash;and the bill was returned to the Senate. The Senate again insisted on its amendments and on 19 November 1997 the House again rejected those amendments. The bill was then laid aside.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is reintroducing this bill because it has a mandate to enact it. It was announced before the election. It was a specific election commitment and the government has a mandate to have it introduced. The government believes that the people of Australia deserve better fiscal accountability and improved fiscal outcomes. To show its commitment to this, the government has already been complying in full with the charter's requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The need for the bill is clearly demonstrated by the need for improved fiscal outcomes in Australia. There have been persistent Commonwealth budget deficits over the past 25 years. This has led to Commonwealth general government net debt ratcheting up to nearly 20 per cent of GDP by 1995&hyphen;96. This government has been repairing the fiscal mess left by the Labor Party. Before we came to office, we were told the budget was in surplus. It was not; it was in deficit to the tune of $10 billion. We inherited that problem. It became our responsibility to fix it and to put aside the mismanagement and the way in which the then government had sought to hide it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of the government's fiscal consolidation program, the budget is expected to move into surplus by 1998&hyphen;99. Continued 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> surpluses are projected until the turn of the century. This year we are paying off debt. We expect to do that next year as well and to halve the level of Commonwealth general government debt to around 10 per cent of GDP by the turn of the century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill will help to ensure that the fiscal profligacy of our predecessors is not repeated. It aims to ensure that all future governments are disciplined and that the process is transparent and accountable in operating fiscal policy. Fiscal discipline will be enhanced by requiring government fiscal policy to be formulated according to the principles of sound fiscal management. Transparency and the accountability of government will be substantially increased through improved disclosure of fiscal policy intentions and the regular reporting of information on fiscal developments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, the charter will prevent future governments going to an election on the basis of outdated and misleading information on the fiscal and economic outlook. In short, this bill will ensure that at all times this government and future governments can be held accountable for their fiscal and economic policies and thereby provide the basis for a sounder economic performance for the economy as a whole, sustainable job opportunities for our people and greater accountability of government to the electors whom they serve. I would like to highlight some of the main features of the fiscal framework that will be established by the bill.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Fiscal Policy Formulation</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill will reform fiscal policy formulation through introducing principles for the sound management of fiscal policy against which governments must develop their fiscal strategy. These principles will focus attention on a range of issues that must be addressed if fiscal policy is to be sustainable over time. The principles take account of the need to address short&hyphen;term issues, such as cyclical economic downturns, while recognising the importance of medium&hyphen;term issues such as the sustainability of government debt and national saving. The presentation of a government fiscal strategy, as required by the bill, will also increase public awareness of a govern 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="12236"> ment's objectives and establish a benchmark for evaluating fiscal performance.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Fiscal Reporting</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The charter of budget honesty will also ensure that up&hyphen;to&hyphen;date information is available so that a government's performance can be assessed against its fiscal objectives. To achieve this, the bill establishes a formal reporting structure. With each year's budget, a report will be released setting out economic and fiscal projections for the budget year and three forward years. These projections will illustrate the consequences of the adopted fiscal strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A further report released midway through the financial year will update the fiscal and economic projections contained in the budget report. The details of fiscal outcomes for the just completed financial year will be presented in a report to be released within three months of the end of that financial year. In addition, an intergenerational report will be produced every five years to report on the long&hyphen;term sustainability of current fiscal policies. These reports will provide fundamental information that will allow government performance to be assessed against the objectives set out in the fiscal strategy statement. However, the bill also gives particular attention to ensuring that important fiscal information is available during the election period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In doing that, we want to make sure that no other government in future behaves in the way in which the Labor government behaved in the March 1996 election. That government shamefully hid the true state of the books. That is why we intend to make it incumbent for a full and open report to be made about the financial state of the books at the opening of an election campaign and not to be found out by whichever government wins at the close. The only way to ensure that is done is for both houses of parliament, the parliament as a whole, to pass this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill requires the Secretaries to the Treasury and the Department of Finance and Administration to prepare a pre&hyphen;election report providing an updated assessment of the fiscal and economic outlook. Never again, if this legislation passes, would a government be able to go into an election without the public 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> being aware of the current economic and fiscal situation. Never again would a government be able to practise the deception attempted by the Labor Party in the last election. Never again would that be allowed if this legislation is enacted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, the bill provides for more equal access to Treasury and Finance costings of election commitments by the government and the opposition during the caretaker period. This will allow the electorate to be better informed of the financial implications of election commitments. These provisions are fair and balanced and consistent with the principles of Westminster government. The amendments to these arrangements that had been sought by the opposition are non&hyphen;transparent and unworkable. This legislation prepared by the government is state&hyphen;of&hyphen;the&hyphen;art legislation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, the government believes that the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill 1996 represents a landmark development in the conduct of fiscal policy and reporting of fiscal outcomes. It is the kind of reform which, when enacted, will change the way in which elections are conducted; the way in which policies are implemented; the way in which future generations are brought into consideration in economic decision making; and our economic policy for the better. The bill will provide a strong impetus towards achieving better fiscal outcomes by providing greater discipline in policy formulation, regular statements of fiscal objectives and increased accountability for fiscal performance. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill and I commend the bill to the House.</PARA>

These arrangements are already in place in respect of senators, following resolution of the Senate agreeing to a transfer of responsibility.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the members and supporters of this Gordon Gekko government continue to wend their way out of this House, they can be proud that an extra $40 million of Commonwealth government moneys is going to pay for an increase in sales commission as a result of an unexpected increase in the proceeds of the partial privatisation of Telstra. I think there would be no-one on the other side of the House, in this coalition government, who would nay&hyphen;say, or did nay&hyphen;say at any point in time, that Telstra should be sold. In fact, they have lauded that sale to the greatest heights.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For me, as the member for Blaxland, this is one of the worst decisions any government, and particularly this government, could have taken. I typify them as a Gordon Gekko government because this is an example of what we have seen previously in the states of New South Wales and Victoria. The most important publicly owned asset and publicly owned infrastructure that this country has&mdash;Telstra&mdash;is to be sold away to private interests. Some of those private interests will be individual citizens of this country. Some of those citizens took those shares up; some of them will then on&hyphen;sell them, because they were sold relatively cheaply and the price increased greatly, to institutions; and there may also be on&hyphen;selling to foreign entities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over a long period of time under Thatcher in Britain, and now here under coalition governments in the Australian states, we have seen the direct ripping away of important social and governmental infrastructure. With Telstra, we are dealing with the most significant piece of infrastructure that this country has ever had. Every citizen and resident of the Commonwealth of Australia owned 100 per cent of Telecom and then Telstra. There is no need now, and there certainly was no need before the float, for that entity to be sold and for some citizens and residents of this land to have to buy it a second time, because what 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12241"> they were and are buying into is a key element of the economy of the 21st century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Gordon Gekkos of the 1980s&mdash;those here in Australia, and those in the United States&mdash;who attempted to aggregate to themselves run&hyphen;down companies and strip them of their assets, understood that great wealth could be gained by working their way through companies and the share market. This coalition government has already sold one-third of Telstra; this Prime Minister, John Howard, is utterly determined to sell the rest&mdash;and he always has been. What he would sell is the technological infrastructure and the communications infrastructure that could be the backbone and framework of Australia's economy for the next century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What will happen with this one&hyphen;third change and, if this government stays in power directly&mdash;and I doubt that it will&mdash;the sale of the rest of a fully government owned entity? The reality would be that, instead of a strong central control and one central framework for telecommunications in this country&mdash;a massive locational advantage that Australia has when compared not only with other nations in the region but also with the United States of America, which has a dramatically fragmented and distorted telecommunications infrastructure&mdash;those moneys, the $40 million, that have been appropriated here to pay for the extra costs of that float could have been expended towards better, wider and more general support for the existing telecommunications structure we have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By the year 2030, 35 per cent of the gross national product of this Commonwealth of Australia will be in the telecommunications industry. If Telstra were maintained in full public ownership, then all its profits and proceeds would come back to Telstra, then to the Australian government and then to the Australian people. Because of the sale of one-third of Telstra, one-third of the profits will not be going into that entity. They will be going to private share takers&mdash;private share takers who are Australian citizens or residents. They will also be going to other Australian companies and to overseas persons and entities.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those profits should have been ploughed back into the Australian nation, the Australian people and Australia's infrastructure. If we are to look at the nature, scope and shape of the economy in the 21st century&mdash;and we have seen in recent times just how fragile our region is, and how important it is that the economies of those countries be restructured, and restructured effectively&mdash;an important key element is that our trade and our future depend on certain trade with the Asia Pacific region, Europe and the rest of the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had a massive advantage in fully owning Telstra; that is now one-third cut to pieces. The Prime Minister wants to sell all of it; he has always wanted to sell all of it. In 1991, in this House, in a debate in relation to the future of the Aussat satellite, he put his base position. His base position was that he wanted to see all of Telstra privatised. He wanted to follow what Nick Greiner had done in New South Wales when he privatised entities in that state. When he did that, publicly owned utilities went into private hands. Instead of building publicly funded roads, they built privately funded roads.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As coalition ministers from the State of New South Wales lost their seats and moved out into private life, one after another they took up positions on boards, such as those concerned with the privately funded roads in New South Wales. I can only expect and anticipate that it is possible that members of this House, as they move out of here, may be looking to similar positions on boards related to Telstra&mdash;a Telstra that is completely broken up into a number of different companies and entities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that this important piece of infrastructure, this central part of the economy for the next century, should have remained totally in the hands of the people who already owned it 100 per cent and supported it 100 per cent; that it should not have had one&hyphen;third ripped out of it just because of our having a Gordon Gekko government; and that there should not be the selling off of the other two-thirds by this Gordon Gekko government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this vital piece of infrastructure is ripped to pieces and sold off, and if public goods and public profits are transferred into the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12242"> hands of private people and institutions, it does the people of Australia, both now and in the future, no good at all. Telstra can remain the driving force of economic change within this country; it can remain the driving force of the telecommunications and information revolution in Australia and in the region. It can do that more effectively if it remains two&hyphen;thirds in public hands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But those people in the coalition are happy to see one-third gone; they are happy to see fully publicly owned entities&mdash;this one being far more important than any other&mdash;being handed off to private individuals and the private sector; and they would be happy if $40 million of Commonwealth money&mdash;more than the amount that was given previously&mdash;were to be handed over. At the same time, the members of this coalition government, led by the Prime Minister, John Howard, would clap their hands in joy&mdash;and they have&mdash;at the fact that the Department of Administrative Services is no more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prior to the Prime Minister taking the knife to David Jull, the then minister, prior to his taking the knife to the entire department and scattering it to the four winds&mdash;part of it became the Department of Finance and Administration and part of it became a reconstituted Department of the Special Minister of State&mdash;and prior to the sacking of the secretary and deputy secretary, we had seen a complete engorgement of the Department of Administrative Services' functions, which were whipped away and whittled away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is only one book that you need to find: a mid&hyphen;sized, yellow compendium of what this government is about&mdash;the National Commission of Audit. The bottom line of the National Commission of Audit is that the federal government of Australia should not intervene in anything in Australia; that its only job in the end is to set benchmarks and to monitor them; to do nothing positively, to be involved in no major campaigns and to deliver no direct services to the people of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that they have done a great deal of disservice over the past 19 or 20 months. That has been the case with Telstra and with a number of other issues. The heart of the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Department of Administrative Services was ripped out before it was cut to pieces totally and banished to the four winds. But here we have an appropriation totalling roughly $71 million and the minister has indicated that this is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . for managing surplus staff of the former Department of Administrative Services business units for which the actual costs could not be reliably determined until arrangements for the sale of the businesses had been completed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">These surplus staff have been sacked. These surplus staff will be added to the thousands of people who have already been sacked by this government. These sackings, these redundancies and this unemployment have led to a complete recession in the city of Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That has been allied to the fact that this government have got out of the business of being in government in relation to performing their IT functions: they have outsourced them. They have flattened Canberra with a mallet for more than 12 months. Private companies providing computer services to the government were flattened with a mallet for more than 12 months. They were told, `Hold it, don't do anything. We'll spend a little time&mdash;six to 12 months&mdash;working out what we are going to outsource and what we are not going to outsource. If you are still around in 12 months time, when we finally make a decision, good luck to you. Your business may prosper and your staff may go on.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A lot of businesses in those 12 months were flattened, as this city of Canberra has been flattened by this vicious government. Not only have they flattened people here; they entirely mogadoned the Australian economy. The Treasurer (Mr Costello) told us yesterday that the last quarter's growth was about 1.5 per cent, annualised to about six per cent&mdash;fast growth that has its basis essentially in pent&hyphen;up consumer demand. For more than 20 months they have been utterly traumatised by this coalition government. They know that the mallet has been taken to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They know that the mallet has been taken to the Bankstown Taxation Office, due to close in June 1998. That closure has been accelerated by the Department of the Treasury, I believe on orders from the Treasurer. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12243"> They want to get them out as soon as possible. Some 680 people working in my electorate in Bankstown in the Taxation Office, doing good work to protect the revenue of the Commonwealth, have been scattered. Where to? To Hurstville and Parramatta primarily and to the North Shore. These 680 people worked where the work was: right next to the small businesses that they were investigating. They were close to the people who needed their services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I see nothing in these appropriations&mdash;and I wonder where it is buried&mdash;about the cost for the next four years that this government is paying out on the property in Meredith Street in Bankstown which was leased for 10 years by the Commonwealth. Treasury took out the lease. They have now decided to entirely close down that space, and they are still paying out Commonwealth moneys and will pay out Commonwealth moneys when they are not using the space at all. They have transferred all of those people to other places.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government prides itself on cutting expenditures. I have outlined two increases in expenditures here which I believe have been for no good purpose. Those increases in expenditures underline the fact that the approach of this government is to sell off public goods to private purchasers for, in the end, their private profit; and to destroy Commonwealth government departments and functions because they see no essential service for them. Department after department have had their functions and their ability to perform their duties whittled and stripped away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In these papers we also see for the Department of Health and Family Services a number of interesting items. We know what impact there has been on regional affairs through the intercession of this government. Under point 5 in the schedule, under the heading `Residential care for older people, including expenditure under the Aged or Disabled Persons Care Act 1954', there is a saving of $7,535,000. I want to know&mdash;and this would be incredibly important to the people affected&mdash;whether those funds simply were not spent, whether they were delayed or whether they have been shovelled into the big bucket of savings in consolidated revenue.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For people who are aged or disabled or who are in residential care&mdash;and where services are given to rural, remote and other special needs groups&mdash;if more than $7&half; million is not being expended or being used for their benefit and care, or if it has been delayed, we can understand that there may have been some program problems. If it has been cut, it would give us a greater understanding of what this government is really on about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In point 6 there are some indications that there are cuts to funding for people with disabilities. In point 7, child&hyphen;care assistance, there is a saving of $6,300,000. The estimated savings in child&hyphen;care expenses for sole parents undergoing training are $2 million. Any society worth its salt is measured by the manner in which it treats the poor, the indigent, the disabled, the weak and the unhealthy. A society that can stare itself in the face and be proud of what it has done in that regard knows that it is healthy, knows that it is strong, knows that it cares. Because of its policies in relation to these areas and aged care generally, this government should be completely, utterly, totally taken to pieces and fully condemned. Because of its policies this government has heartlessly and viciously cut into funding for the aged, the poor, the indigent and those without resources in this community. This government has effectively told these people&mdash;but we will tell them even more effectively&mdash;that this government does not believe it is government's responsibility to provide direct services to the people of Australia who are the weakest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This coalition government believe what it says in this National Commission of Audit book&mdash;the big yellow book that they follow. It says that the government should provide no direct services to people. They increasingly believe that direct services should be paid for by the people who use them. They believe that is the case for child care and for aged care. Later, another appropriation for $20 million of capital funding will come before this House to provide for nursing home care. The key problem with nursing home care and nursing homes is that private providers have pocketed the profits and not reinvested in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12244"> their own entities, their own nursing home institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a Gordon Gekko mentality within those private institutions. The not for profit sector has reinvested, has used Commonwealth capital funds provided in the past by the former federal Labor government, to build high quality nursing home and hostel accommodation. With this government there is the question of a split between what can be seen in society and their approach. This Gordon Gekko government cares more about the individual rights and benefits of private people than the public good.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous speaker, the member for Blaxland (Mr Hatton), commented on the lack of resources provided by this government to rural and regional Australia. I suggest to him that at long last the people in rural and regional Australia are getting some acknowledgment and certainly some support from a government&mdash;this government. They certainly did not get it in the past. In fact, rural and regional Australia was grossly neglected and overlooked by the previous government in its pursuit to look after minority interests. Given that the member for Blaxland has almost no colleagues in rural and regional Australia now, he should take the time to go out and have a look. The people in rural and regional Australia will tell him what they think of the previous regime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Blaxland made a comment about this government cutting funding for people with disabilities. For the first time, carers and people with disabilities have the real focus of a government. Resources and recognition is being afforded to these very special groups by this government. I think that is commendable of this government. It is about time that it happened. Carers, in particular, are a group of people who were very rarely seen; they certainly were not heard. They were totally ignored by the previous 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government. I do not believe that it is appropriate for the member for Blaxland to stand up here and suggest that these areas have been totally neglected by this government. I think these people are starting to get the recognition that they have been screaming for for a long time. I can assure the member for Blaxland that we are starting to fill in the $10&half; billion black hole. Carers and other groups will reap the benefit because the government will be able to afford to put resources into those areas rather than continuing to have to focus on borrowing money just to pay our interest bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that, I would like to continue. The  Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 1997&hyphen;98  which is before the House today will allow the Public Service to better serve our national interests, not only ensuring well targeted funding to Public Service programs but also taking care of public servants themselves. Despite much of the criticism levelled at the Public Service in general terms, the Australian Public Service does a very good job, and career public servants should be commended for their lifetime service. I am using this opportunity to raise an issue that has affected one such public servant in my electorate. I believe he has been very badly treated. The situation needs to be addressed quickly to give him the justice that I feel is appropriate. There are, sadly, incidences when public servants are not treated well by their own bureaucracy. At this point I would like to focus the attention of the House on the plight of Mr Philip Crockford, who has given some 20 years of service to Airservices Australia as an aviation firefighter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 26 February 1994, Mr Crockford fell off a fire truck while on duty, due to a faulty rubber tread. He fell approximately 1.3 metres to the ground, severely injuring his knee. After this accident it was found that the rubber treads on the fire vehicle did not meet Australian standards and had been produced with manufacturing faults. Airservices quickly ordered the replacement of all the steps on the trucks and notified all personnel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following complications with his knee, Mr Crockford had an operation in March 1995. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12245"> His knee joint was found to be seriously injured and the surgeon declared him unfit for duty as a fire officer on medical grounds. He was then given light duties, which he performed until his retrenchment in September that year. Mr Crockford lodged a claim for compensation with Comcare, but they did not accept his claim. He appealed their refusal. They later accepted his claim&mdash;and this happened to occur on the same day he was officially retrenched from Airservices. Upon retrenchment, Mr Crockford received a superannuation payment of $151,068 gross. Airservices Australia assured him that this money would not in any way affect his appeal to, and compensation from, Comcare. Airservices, in fact, assured him of this in writing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After accepting his claim, Comcare advised him that he would receive his full salary for 45 weeks and 75 per cent of his salary thereafter until the age of 65. Any medical expenses incurred because of the injury would also be covered. Mr Crockford received his usual weekly salary until January last year. In the following month or two, his weekly payments were significantly reduced from $880 to $453. This was, of course, far below the 75 per cent he had been promised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Naturally, he appealed this steep reduction in his salary as it was contrary to the advice given to him by Comcare. He was then informed that, due to a mistake on Comcare's part from the start of the case, he had been overpaid by almost $11,000. Comcare also informed him that as he had received $151,068 in superannuation upon retrenchment and, due to an error, had initially been assessed under the wrong section of the Safety and Rehabilitation Compensation Act he was being assessed under section 19 when, according to Comcare, he should have been assessed under section 21A. Both Airservices and Comcare were at fault in this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Section 19, I believe, applies to employees who are injured and therefore incapacitated for work but who are not entitled to a superannuation pension or lump sum payout. They would be in receipt of 75 per cent of their weekly salary&mdash;and this is indexed until retirement age of 65. Section 21A applies to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> those who are incapacitated for work but who are entitled to a superannuation pension and not a lump sum payout. In these cases, 75 per cent of weekly salary, less the  employer's compulsory superannuation contribution plus interest and the normal superannuation contribution they would make if still employed in their former positions, is payable until the age of 65.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under this new section, section 21A, $84,136, including interest, of Airservices' compulsory superannuation contributions to Mr Crockford's super over 20 years, and $14,000 paid in tax, had to be returned to Comcare. In other words, this money will be put towards his weekly payments until the age of 65 as part of his compensation. It is interesting to note that the superannuation contribution equivalent to the amount he would have had to make while employed as a fire officer grade 2 is currently being deducted from Mr Crockford's weekly payments. To a layman, this effectively means that, after 20 years of faithful service, Mr Crockford will be getting a superannuation payment of only $41,648&mdash;that is in cash&mdash;and a rollover of $10,598 at the age of 55. In effect, he will also be funding his own compensation payments to a large degree from his superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe it is a travesty that because of an ineffective and faulty step tread on his fire vehicle Mr Crockford suffered an injury which is costing him a 20-year career and the loss of more than $50,000 in wages and superannuation per annum. He is only 49 years of age and he dearly wants to be rehabilitated back into the work force&mdash;as Airservices had once promised it would. If Airservices is unable to re&hyphen;employ him in a suitable position, it is only just that he should be appropriately compensated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the time of my initial representation to the minister for industrial relations on Mr Crockford's behalf in November last year, Mr Crockford was waiting for his third hearing from the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The minister wrote back to me in December last year and advised that Mr Crockford's case had been dismissed by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal on 19 November last 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12246"> year. He did not, however, elaborate on the reasons for the dismissal of his appeal. This was very disappointing. Unfortunately, we felt that, given the immovability of some of the bureaucracy and some of the regulations they have to enforce, maybe we were beating our heads against a brick wall.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it has been recently brought to my attention that the Administrative Appeals Tribunal did not dismiss Mr Crockford's case at all. They were simply not in a position to proceed further with his case on the grounds that the matter was outside their stipulated powers. It was clearly conveyed to Mr  Crockford that the Administrative Appeals Tribunal could only consider a case where an authority&mdash;Comcare in this instance&mdash;was correctly following guidelines at the time of the hearing. His appeal, however, relates to Comcare's earlier treatment of him when it was evident that Comcare did not follow the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 as it should have done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Crockford had little choice but to withdraw his case. This was done so on the advice of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Despite the fact that his appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal did not result in a determination, his efforts were not entirely in vain. Members of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal understood Mr Crockford's predicament and must have sympathised with him. It was suggested that he look up subsection 114B(5) and subsections 114D(1-5) of the SRC Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Subsection 114B(5) deals with the fact that any irregularities&mdash;overpayments, for instance&mdash;must be rectified within two working days by Comcare, whilst subsections 114D(1-5) make provision for Comcare to waive the debt. Comcare has certainly failed to comply with subsection 114B(5). It is very clearly stipulated in subsection 114B(5) that Comcare has two working days in which to rectify an overpayment. Comcare took much more than a couple of days to rectify their administrative error. It took them well over six months. Judging from the information that I have on hand and the treatment Mr Crockford has received to date, it is difficult not to conclude 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that he is being forced to pay for the mistakes and tardiness of Comcare.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As mentioned earlier, Mr Crockford is only 49 years of age. As a result of an injury suffered in no way through any fault of his own, his working lifespan has suddenly been cut short by some 16 years. This is enormously tragic for a man who has given over 20 years of service to Airservices Australia and total dedication to a job that he loved very much. As an aviation fire officer grade 2, he held an important and responsible position in the organisation. The fact that Mr Crockford had accumulated over 400 hours of sick leave at the time of the accident is indicative, I believe, of the depth of his commitment to his work and his loyalty to Airservices. He certainly did not abuse his sick leave and take time off just for the sake of it. He was very committed to his job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Crockford's 400 hours of accumulated sick leave could easily have carried him through to January 1996 on full pay. When he was retrenched in September 1995, he was effectively forced to forgo his sick leave entitlement. Had he not been in receipt of grossly inaccurate and misleading advice from both Airservices Australia and Comcare he would not have been in the unfortunate predicament that he now finds himself in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To deny Mr Crockford justice now is to add to his tragedy&mdash;and this, in my opinion, is totally unacceptable. It would be a disgrace if he were to be made to carry Comcare's shortcomings as well as the consequences of their attempts to cover up their errors. It is also disappointing that Mr Crockford was not made aware earlier of sections 114B and 114D of the SRC Act. I cannot see why the department could not have made him aware of that instead of its having to be quietly mentioned to him by one of the employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In light of the specific provisions made under section 114D for Comcare to waive the debt, the general nature of Mr Crockford's case, the inaccurate advice he received from Airservices and Comcare coupled with Comcare's inability to have their `administrative error' rectified within the stipulated time frame, it would appear that the use of section 114D in Mr Crockford's case could be very 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12247"> well justified. I therefore call on Comcare to get off Mr Crockford's back, accept responsibility for their errors, honour their original commitments and let him get on with his life. Not only should the debt resulting from the overpayment be waived, but whatever money Mr Crockford already paid back should be fully refunded to him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just as the various arms of the Public Service will be in a position to provide a better standard of service through funds made available through today's parliamentary departments appropriation bill, I urge that Mr Crockford's situation be addressed so he can at least enjoy a decent standard of living. I certainly commend the bills to the House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have with me a car tidy bag which has been produced by a company which rejoices in the name of the `No Worries Co. Pty Ltd', and it is described as the `AussieCare' car tidy bag. It has an Australian-made logo on it, with a green triangle and yellow kangaroo silhouetted against it. It even has the `Keep Australia beautiful' logo on it as well. When we come across a product like this we would be entitled to think that it was in fact made in Australia. The Australian-made logo, `No Worries Co.', `AussieCare', `Keep Australia beautiful'&mdash;you name it, it is there. But when we look inside the package we find a small label saying `Made in India'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That kind of thing has arisen following this government's decision in August last year to withdraw funding from the Advance Australia Foundation, which administered the Australian-made logo and the Australian-made campaign, causing the Advance Australia Foundation to go into liquidation. That has had disastrous effects, in my view. Firstly, there is no promotion of the Australian-made campaign. We no longer hear the `true-blue' jingle or see `buy Australian' ads. The campaign is waning for want of, firstly, promotion and, secondly, policing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we have ended up with situations like this&mdash;where any company can use the Australian-made logo and therefore diminish its significance. Certainly that is a fraud on the 1,800 licensees who have been paying 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> their licence fees&mdash;or who were paying their licence fees up until the middle of last year&mdash;to take advantage of the Australian-made logo and to market Australian-made products both domestically and overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's announcement on 19 November of their intention to enact some legislation concerning the Trade Practices Act is simply not good enough. Back in 1995, Labor had introduced legislation to amend the Trade Practices Act to make clear the circumstances in which companies could claim to produce Australian-made products. At the time the opposition were not supportive of what we were proposing, yet two years later they come back into the House and say they are thinking of introducing a bill which will indeed pick up where we left off&mdash;a bill which will be virtually identical to the one we had already introduced in 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I understand it, certainly the House is about to rise for Christmas and this legislation has not been introduced into the House. So it will be 1998 at the earliest until we see that legislation, which might be an important ingredient to policing; but that is not all that is required. What is required as well is to reintroduce the Australian-made program and to reinstate that money that the Howard government took from the Advance Australia Foundation in August of last year. Without that financial support, the Australian-made campaign is just withering on the vine. It is simply not good enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen the same pattern in relation to retail tenancies. We introduced the better business conduct bill in 1995 to provide better protection for retail tenants against retail landlords and for other small businesses which might have difficulties in their dealings with larger businesses. The opposition of the day were not prepared to support that legislation. They said, `We want to have a parliamentary committee. We want to do an inquiry.' They did an inquiry, the fair trading inquiry, which produced many recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But then what did the government come back into the parliament with? They came back with legislation which was virtually identical to the better business conduct bill, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12248"> and indeed Kim Beazley's private member's bill. So we have seen a two-year delay, during which time many retail tenants have been the victims of unfair contracts and unfair conduct and practices by landlords. It has been up to the opposition to move amendments to that fair trading legislation to bring it into line with the recommendations of the Reid committee report of the House of Representatives inquiry into fair trading and to try to make sure that retail tenants are put in a fairer situation in their dealings with retail landlords and shopping centre owners and managers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is part of a pattern of government inaction. I note, concerning the Australian-made campaign, that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS> in June reported that the industry was indeed exasperated with the government's lack of action on this matter, having done in the Australian-made program by its budget cutbacks of August last year and having failed to replace it. That is still the situation. We have seen the former Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs, the member for Forrest, Mr Prosser, have carriage of this and fall by the wayside. The former Minister for Administrative Services, the member for Fadden, Mr Jull, had carriage of this and fell by the wayside. Minister Ellison, I think, had carriage of it at one stage. Now I think the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs, the Hon. Warren Truss, has carriage of it. But, whoever is supposed to be responsible for it, it is not happening. It is simply not good enough. I call on the government to reinstate the Australian-made campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That kind of sloth is characteristic of this government and it is indeed the reason why the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) was unable to provide a 1997 progress report to the people of Australia. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) raised this issue just a day or two ago and quoted the Prime Minister's 1996 report to the people which said:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Prime Minister has set off from his base camp, lost five climbers off the first precipice and half his climbing gear, been cut off by a blizzard, been forced to skin and barbecue the huskies and turned around to see his fellow climbers&mdash;two of them in particular&mdash;heading off back down the mountain.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We have also seen a commentary this year on the conservative government come from Lindsay Olney in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Republican</EMPHASIS>  headed `Travelling PM on the last train to Klutzville'. He states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The images linger still: Howard rained out of his long awaited day at the cricket, Howard tripping in the White House Rose Garden, Howard boring Shirley McLaine to sleep, Howard going inexplicably to the baseball to meet an Australian relief pitcher for the Yankees who was four times his size and not even playing that day . . . so it went on.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We have also had the devastating comments from Paul Kelly saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Howard leads a government that is staggering under its own incompetence. This suggests a depth of political and administrative ineptitude that is generic rather than specific. It brings to a climax much of the private complaint from those who deal with this government that it lacks either the process or the talent to master the issues.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In hearing and reading those quotes, I was reminded of the observations of Joseph Heller in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Catch-22</EMPHASIS>  many years ago about Major Major. These might well be apt concerning the Prime Minister. Heller says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some men are born mediocre, some men achieve mediocrity, and some men have mediocrity thrust upon them. With Major Major it had been all three. Even among men lacking all distinction he inevitably stood out as a man lacking more distinction than all the rest, and people who met him were always impressed by how unimpressive he was.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The economic performance and political performance of the government this year ought to be contrasted with the situation which Labor faced when it came to office. Labor came in confronting Howard's Australia: 11 per cent inflation, 11 per cent unemployment and going up, negative economic growth and, in today's terms, a $25 billion budget deficit. By way of contrast, Prime Minister Howard came in confronting Labor's Australia: 2.5 per cent inflation, 8.5 per cent unemployment and coming down, 4.5 per cent economic growth and an $8 billion budget deficit&mdash;less than one third of his.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12249">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What he managed to do was to turn 4.5 per cent growth in our last year into 1.9 per cent growth in his first year. He took an economy which had generated 242,000 full-time jobs in the last 18 months of Labor government and turned it into one which actually lost 21,000 full-time jobs in his first 18 months. Instead of unemployment levels approaching six per cent at the end of this term, with a vibrant confidence in job security, it will be at best in the low eights or high sevens, with widespread job insecurity remaining. Talk about five minutes of economic sunshine; we are still waiting for the five minutes of economic sunshine to be delivered by this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you think that this year was pretty ordinary, you should look at what is around the corner for a lot of Australians. On 1 January 1998, 2,770 families are going to miss out on family payments because of the tightening of the assets test hardship provisions. On 1 February, a further 850,000 people who suffer from ulcers and blood pressure problems will pay up to $5 more per script for medicine their doctors say they need. On 1 March, nursing home residents will be slugged with up to $63 a day on top of their current $21 daily care fee and the $12 a day accommodation fee brought in after the nursing home bond backflip. From 27 April, families using outside school hours child care will be slugged with an extra $10 a week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During this period, as Employment Australia gets under way over the next few months, tens of thousands of unemployed Australians will pay a $250 job search fee. In addition, an estimated 700,000 taxpayers who do not provide their tax file numbers&mdash;mostly low and middle income earners&mdash;are going to end up paying an estimated $220 million in tax through the government's new superannuation tax, which was only supposed to affect high income earners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things that has troubled me most about this government's performance has been its treatment of older Australians. Let us have a look at the record. It has introduced new up&hyphen;front entry fees for nursing homes&mdash;and the nursing home accommodation bond debacle is well known; I think we are up to something like plan No. 6 now&mdash;that involve 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> residents having to find an extra $4,000 per annum or some uncertain figure of that order. Second, the government has imposed new income tested daily fees for nursing homes on top of the existing daily fees. Third, it has increased the prescription charges from $2.70 to $3.20; four million concession holders now pay 50c more for each prescription&mdash;$25 a year. Fourth, it has cut spending on Australian Hearing Services. Now 30,000 Commonwealth seniors card holders are no longer eligible for free hearing aids.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fifth, it has abolished the Commonwealth dental health program and four million concession card holders now no longer have access to free dental health. Sixth, it has slashed the spending on home and community care services so older Australians who rely on meals on wheels, home help and other home and community care services now have to pay for those essential services. Finally, it has changed the deeming amounts. Pensioners lose up to $2 a fortnight now that the first $2,000 in cash or deposits for a single person or $4,000 for a couple are deemed. These incessant attacks on older people smack of cowardice, and they are a very poor response to the contribution that a lot of older people have made to this community in war time and at many other times.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time as their costs have been going up, the incomes of older Australians have been reduced in a number of ways. Indeed, those who are saving for retirement have been attacked in a variety of ways through the government's changes to superannuation. Investment incomes for self&hyphen;funded retirees and pensioners are being reduced by cutting the deeming interest rate on the bank accounts of people aged over 55 years from four per cent to three per cent. Superannuation assets are also now being included in the social security means test for people aged over 55 who have been in receipt of an income support payment for nine months. The government is effectively telling Australians aged over 55 that they have nine months in which to find a job and if they cannot find one in that time they will be forced to retire. They are going to have to live on their superannuation. Those Australians will lose thou 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="12250"> sands of dollars of income in compound interest which would have accumulated on their superannuation moneys between 55 and retirement age. They will see their superannuation run out and they will then have to line up for the aged pension. This government made elaborate promises to older people, saying that they would be looked after, and those promises have been broken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, the government broke its promise to deliver Labor's three per cent plus three per cent government co-contribution to superannuation. I take the House back to the coalition's 1996 superannuation election policy. They said that a coalition government would:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> support the introduction of compulsory employee contributions to be phased in from 1997/98 at a rate of 1% rising to 3% by 1999/2000;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> provide in full the funds earmarked in the 1995&hyphen;96 Budget to match compulsory employee contributions according to the proposed schedule.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That co&hyphen;contribution plus the nine per cent superannuation guarantee would have lifted an employee's total  superannuation contribution to 15 per cent. At nine per cent, it is estimated that average Australians will have their total retirement income reduced by around $100,000 compared with what they would have achieved at the 15 per cent contributions level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nine per cent contributions will not produce an adequate income for the majority of Australians to enjoy a comfortable lifestyle in retirement. Research done for the ASFA retirement income blueprint and by the AMP Society shows that the nine per cent superannuation guarantee contribution alone will result in a replacement income of around 28 per cent of final income after 30 years. Twenty&hyphen;eight per cent is far below the expectations of most average Australians of around 70 per cent of final income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's second broken promise concerning superannuation was not to introduce any new taxes or increase existing taxes. But it did this in its first budget when it introduced a 15 per cent superannuation tax on high income earners. They said that they were not breaking the promise because this was a surcharge, not a tax. But it is going to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reduce the retirement incomes of low and middle income Australians, firstly, by forcing them to pay the tax if they do not provide their tax file numbers for the superannuation funds and, secondly, even if they do provide their tax file numbers to the funds they will still be hit with increased costs as a result of the wacky and bizarre collection method that the government uses for the tax. For example, Noel Davis from Clayton Utz has estimated that it will cost every fund member at least $30, regardless of whether they pay the tax or not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all remember the government's undertaking to produce a 50 per cent reduction in red tape for small business. Members of the House might be interested to see, if they have not already, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Superannuation Surcharge Member Contributions Instruction Guide and Statement</EMPHASIS>. This is not about reducing red tape; this is about doubling red tape. I understand it contains some 188 separate possible questions. Each of them has to be filled in individually&mdash;they cannot be photocopied. Something like 144,000 small businesses or their tax accountants and advisers are required to complete these forms some 10 days from now. It is an onerous and virtually impossible task for those funds and for those small businesses. It represents a massive increase in small business red tape.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By way of contrast, Labor is very proud of its superannuation record. We established the comprehensive three pillars retirement income system based on government guaranteed age pensions, compulsory superannuation coverage and incentives for voluntary superannuation contributions. It was Labor which positioned superannuation to make a significant contribution to national savings over the medium term. It was Labor which extended access to superannuation benefits throughout the work force, especially to women and to part&hyphen;time workers. When we assumed office in 1983, only 40 per cent of the work force had access to superannuation. When we left office, the figure was over 90 per cent. We established the foundations for bigger retirement incomes with the superannuation guarantee. We put in place a strengthened prudential regime through the SI(S) Act which 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12251"> provides greater confidence that the benefits promised by superannuation will in fact be realised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government's shortcomings are ever more obvious, whether they be in its treatment of older Australians, in its treatment of superannuation, in its treatment of small business or in the way it approaches the Australian&hyphen;made program, having scuttled that program. In all these areas, this is a government which is adrift, a government which is paralysed and a government which, frankly, sounds as convincing as Winnie Mandela. We desperately need the government to get out of the straitjacket it has been in in 1997, to recover from its paralysis and to get onto some of the job security and employment growth issues which are most affecting ordinary Australians. We need the government to revisit some of the poor decisions that it has made concerning superannuation and the Australian&hyphen;made program. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have listened to a number of speeches in this debate on the appropriation bills. It is very instructive to examine some of them. One speaker I probably enjoy listening to more than many others is the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell). He is one of the few people in the place who really listens to his electorate, hears what they are saying and speaks his mind. A disappointing aspect of being in the parliament is that members are not listening properly to their electorate; rather, they are listening to what their parties are telling them to say. Accordingly, we, in this parliament, are frequently getting expressions of view that are not necessarily the views of the great majority of people out there. Nowhere is that better illustrated than by the statements of the member for Kalgoorlie about native title procedure. When speaking about the amendments to the right to negotiate in the original Native Title Act, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> which have been knocked back by the Senate, he mentioned Bill Hayden's comments on that. I think it is instructive to quote Bill Hayden in his letter to the Premier of Queensland on 21 March 1997, bearing in mind that he was a negotiator involved in the Century Zinc negotiations:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What became abundantly clear to me quite early is how complex, even confusing, the drafting of the relevant legislation is&mdash;the opportunities the legislation offers for outside manipulation of processes and for the adoption of measures which come perilously close at times to being extortion; the absence of any definition of who can be a claimant and the seemingly unlimited opportunities for people to register as such; the unrepresentativeness of some who register as claimants; the confusion and tensions which can become rampant as longstanding factional and family disputes within a tribal group manifest themselves at the expense of the issue to be settled; the jealousy and mistrust which can arise between different tribal bodies and which can impair negotiating processes. And this is by no means an exhaustive list of the problems which stud the present Native Title Act.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Incidentally, it is as clear as a pikestaff that the Keating Labor government and parliament more generally believed that it had enacted legislation with the Native Title Act which established, inter alia, that the issue of pastoral lease extinguished any native title which might otherwise have existed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is important to bear in mind the words of a distinguished Australian, someone who was very much politically to the left of Australian politics and who has experience on the ground.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Why I relate that to what I have said about the member for Kalgoorlie is that it is that first&hyphen;hand experience on the ground that gives a very different view of this particular issue. I endorse what the member for Kalgoorlie had to say. I could not fault his criticism of the media. The media reporting of this issue has been absolutely scandalous. It echoes what happened in the Hindmarsh Island fiasco. It echoes the great conspiracy to defraud in that particular case that was manipulated by the media, the churches, the Greens, the Democrats, the Labor Party and a whole host of other groups and finally found to be a monumental fraud.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth quoting what Michael Warby said about journalists, and journalists should hang this up on their walls:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12252">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Journalists are not the moral guardians of either public debate or the community and should not act as such: indeed they can only act as moral guardians by betraying their role as reporters of the community to itself.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I fully agree with those comments. I wish that reporters would not only heed those comments but try to understand what they mean.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the earlier speakers was the member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran), who in his exuberance referred to the former leader of the Australian Democrats turned Labor Party bedmate. I agree with everything the honourable member said except that his welcoming of her to the House&mdash;his exuberant expression of the inevitability of her appearance in this place&mdash;is not shared by all. Perhaps time on the back bench will eventually bring him back to some reality on that issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue I want to speak about, though, relates to one of the most crushing bureaucratic systems that this country is facing and that this parliament has to deal with&mdash;the Child Support Agency. I want to describe a particular process in law for the recovery of a debt. First of all, in law to recover a debt you must prove your claim. In proving your claim you have to set out your statement of claim; the other side has a right to reply to that claim, and then the claim is justiciable in a court of law. After the court considers the merits of the particular claim comes execution, which may mean an oral examination of the debtor. It may also entail, of course, proof on oath verifying the debt is still in existence&mdash;all the way an established procedure which gives the rights to the creditor and the debtor and protects against abuse. That is the way that the courts work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Imagine having all of that power for the benefit of one side only&mdash;that is, there is no court; there are no checks and balances; there is an administrative procedure with the enormous power to make a determination of where the merits lie&mdash;and frequently that is done with a stroke of the pen; and enormous power to execute, to make judgments of law without hearing any arguments and to make decisions that can literally destroy lives without the slightest equity attaching to the life being destroyed.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have this in the Child Support Agency, and I want to give you some examples of that. It is important that one reflects on that, particularly those who know how the law works, to just see how we have got this powerful body which can do all these things and yet is not sufferable and not subject to the constraints of a court of law. The following example is a real one from my electorate. My constituent worked in the public service in Victoria for 10 years. In that time he was a single man, he had bought his own home, had a car and led a fairly comfortable lifestyle. He met and married a woman who brought no assets whatsoever into the marriage. The marriage was relatively short&mdash;seven years. It produced three children. He continued in his occupation. When the marriage broke down, there was a property settlement. As a result of that property settlement, my constituent no longer had a house or a decent car. Then his former wife and three children moved interstate and he, anxious to be with his children, moved interstate as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question arose then about how he could negotiate a redundancy. He managed to negotiate a redundancy with the relevant public service department but an issue arose as to liability in respect of the redundancy payment as far as the Child Support Agency was concerned. A bureaucrat decided that for the purposes of child support the agency would take one third of the whole of his redundancy payment. He, not unnaturally, protested that for 10 years of the slightly longer than 17 years that he was in the public service he was not even married to the woman, so 10 years of that redundancy payment was arguably his. But the Child Support Agency&mdash;acting as judge, jury and executioner, as I said&mdash;said that 10 years would be levied to the extent of 30 per cent. So what position does he find himself in? He has no car of any substance&mdash;it is an old bomb&mdash;and he resides in rented accommodation, while his wife has a $30,000 car, her own house and recently had a breast enlargement job at his expense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the sort of incredible injustice that is going on in relation to the Child Support 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12253"> Agency. It can interfere with orders of the court. I have two examples of that. I have a constituent who went to the Family Court and had a consent order in relation to property and maintenance&mdash;all of those things were sorted out at the consent order stage including the property settlement. Within a few days of the consent order being signed, the wife went to the Child Support Agency and the agency said, `As far as we are concerned, we are not interested in the consent order; we will make a retrospective assessment.' They made a retrospective assessment in relation to child support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact of the matter is that is not the only case where they are making decisions of law on orders. There is another case where a couple had a property settlement and an undertaking was given by the husband to pay maintenance at a certain figure&mdash;an undertaking, not an order of the court&mdash;but, of course, the Child Support Agency are not interested in those sorts of legal subtleties. The property settlement was deliberately entered into so that the constituent and his wife would not be subject to the Child Support Agency. They could only not be subject to the agency if they reached an agreement whereby he gave an undertaking to the court&mdash;which was not an order of the court, and the agency has got jurisdiction only where there is an order of the court. The Child Support Agency were not interested. They said, `That is an order as far as we are concerned and we will enforce that particular order.' How do you change that? `You can change that if you want to, but you have got to go back to court to change it and you have got to pay the costs of doing so.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are a few examples of an absolutely deplorable system which is breaking a million families in this country, and we are not listening when we sit back and say, `Well, send the person here and send the person there and ring up the child support registrar.' Mr Roger Price, the member for Chifley, told me when he was chairing the committee that the day they had a phone&hyphen;in here on the Child Support Agency there were 100,000 hits that particular day in Parliament House. That is the sort of stuff that is going on in relation to that agency. The number of complaints 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> surrounding the Child Support Agency is just incredible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a solution for the Child Support Agency debacle, and it is a solution which I hope my side of politics and the other side of politics will listen to, because it is the only solution. We should be different as Liberals from the other side of politics, because we did not devise the Child Support Agency; the socialists did. It is a socialist system. There is no question of that. It is a socialist system which makes everybody the same whereas each couple wants their own individual circumstances to be considered.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member who interjects would have to accept that that is the biggest problem. People complain that they do not get a fair hearing on their arrangements. How do we do it? We set up a small claims child support tribunal. That tribunal will be attached to the magistrates' courts and courts of petty sessions around this country. There is where the expertise is for dealing with ordinary people in the suburbs with their ordinary problems in relation to child support. What would that tribunal do? It would be cheap, it would be efficient, it would be quick and it would not be a place where lawyers would be allowed except with leave; and leave would be given only in exceptional circumstances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would work on the fundamental principle that the child support system tore up and threw out the window. That principle would be the needs of the child and the capacity to pay of both parents. That is the fundamental principle that has been ignored. It has been ignored in such a way that a man who came to one of our child support meetings, a waterside worker on reasonable income, was paying $200 a week for a three&hyphen;year&hyphen;old child&mdash;the same figure that would be assessed for a 16&hyphen;year&hyphen;old child. How is that fair? How is that equitable? How does that relate to the needs of the child? That was a free lunch for the mother, not to do with the needs of the child. We should set up a system which will assess child support, which will enforce payment of child support and enforce orders. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12254"> I do not mean any weak and wimpish system, because when people do not pay there should be a very strong system to deal with those who do not pay. Any person should be able to very cheaply make an application to that tribunal to have a departure order from child support, and there the principle would be explored, with evidence on oath from both sides, with the guiding principle being needs and capacity to pay. Both sides could apply for a departure order.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, there would be no legal representation except in cases of contempt. Why do we need contempt? There are people who do not pay, and those people should be subject to contempt proceedings in certain circumstances. But the people who do not pay frequently are those who are able to arrange their affairs in business so as to hide their income and their assets in various trusts and companies and siphoning it off to other parties and so forth. Those people would have to go before the tribunal and the tribunal would have the power of oral examination on oath. How many of those people who do not pay would want to go to such a tribunal and have their affairs examined on oath? Very few. It is, generally speaking, mothers involved who are not getting their money from these sorts of people, and they would find themselves getting a settlement very quickly in those circumstances. So the magistrate is best suited to deal with this issue; not a bunch of experts in a university determining what a child costs. We know what figures they will come up with. They will come up with $500 a week; that will be the theoretical basis. The magistrates in the local suburbs, like Petrie in my electorate, are the people who are in touch with the community and in touch with the needs and capacity to pay principle. As I said, evidence would be given on oath. Rules of evidence would not apply, but the magistrate would be careful to consider all the evidence submitted to him or her.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Failure to pay, where it is wilful and deliberate, could in some circumstances amount to a contempt of the tribunal, with consequent penalties&mdash;including, in appropriate circumstances, although I would envisage it to be rare, imprisonment. That is if failure to pay 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> was deliberate and wilful. After all, we are talking about children whose fathers or mothers, but mostly fathers in that situation, would be saying, `I am not paying for him; let the state pay for that child.' That is just not on under this system. There would be fairness, and that is the essence of it. There would be our philosophy, the Liberal philosophy, the rights of individuals, coming into this process. We seem to have forgotten about that. The lines seem to be far more blurred than they used to be in this parliament, I can assure you. Where there was a clear distinction between us and them, the lines are getting more and more blurred. I can tell you that the people of Australia are seeing that and are concerned about it. They are saying, `You are no different from them.' Well, there are some in this parliament who are different and who are prepared to stand up for the old principles for which the Liberal Party stood when I joined it in 1974. There would be a saving to the community under this system. Ultimately it would give the individual couples the right to be heard. The biggest cause of anguish and despair in this system is the fact that people are shut out by this administrative monster which is the Child Support Agency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I urge the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams), who is sitting at the table, to look at this system I am proposing. It is a good idea, if I say so myself. The problem with the old system was the failure to enforce. As long as you put the enforcement part of this particular system in place, it will be a good system. It will get these people who are being crushed by the system out of their administrative malaise and at least get them before a court. There would be plenty who would not want to do that, but there would be a lot of people who would, and we have to listen to the voices of the people who are saying that to us. I commend that proposal to the House, and I hope that those who are in a position to do something about it are listening, because the community is expecting us to do something about this terrible issue. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the 1980s the rise and extent of economic and social change, often caused by forces which are remote, global and impersonal, has led to a dramatic loss of confidence&mdash;both personal and collective&mdash;in the political process. Government is, at worst, seen as `the enemy' and, at best, has suffered a loss of legitimacy. I cannot remember a time when the political system has been in such low repute. I used to be proud to be a member of parliament. Now I feel uneasy to admit it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The computer&hyphen;communications revolution, the development of a global economy and the pre&hyphen;eminence of free market economics contributed to a collapse of faith in governments, notably in the command economies of the former Soviet bloc but also in democratically elected ones. Governments might have been expected to take the lead in planning for an era of unusually rapid change but collapse of confidence in political processes had a serious impact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At a time when technology provided a unique capacity to break down hierarchies and promote individual autonomy, citizens felt confused, marginalised and frustrated, and fear encouraged desperation. Voters complained of a leadership vacuum and a sense of being disenfranchised. This was understandable when the impact of rapid change and globalisation&mdash;its pluses and minuses&mdash;were never explained to them. Workers suffered from change fatigue. In 1996 a deep sense of accumulated grievance contributed to Labor's massive defeat.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The term `economic rationalism' may be an Australian coinage. Dr Bruce Moore in the new <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Concise Oxford Dictionary</EMPHASIS> thinks it is. Every value was assumed to have a dollar equivalent. If not, it was disregarded. The bottom line became paramount in policy making. Economics displaced the concept of the public good. Changes were rarely explained to voters. Indeed, they were sometimes told the contrary: for example, that the Commonwealth Bank and Qantas would not be sold. Elites reached a consensus on a major policy and then imposed it top down. The political process was compliant. Then came the voter backlash. As Isaac Newton proposed in his Third Law of Motion, `To every action is always opposed an equal reaction.'</PARA>

Commitment to traditional reliance on `comparative advantage'&mdash;that is, the idea that all wealth comes out of the land&mdash;and rejection of `competitive advantage', the important distinction made by Harvard's Michael Porter, illustrated by Australia's failures in innovation and industry policy and its deep international isolation on greenhouse issues.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and, earlier, the collapse of the Soviet system, and the Gulf War.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">5. The disappearance of the public intellectual. How many of them are under 50?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Globalisation appears to be unstoppable, but it poses serious threats to national political, economic and technological autonomy. It may make democracy irrelevant; it certainly contributes to the sense of powerlessness of ordinary citizens. My friend Kimon Valaskakis, now the Canadian Ambassador to the OECD, argues that at present 200 economic entities rule the world: 160 of them are corporations; only 40 are nation states. Who, he asks&mdash;perhaps the Attorney-General (Mr Williams), who is at the table, might respond&mdash;legislates for the 200, or can legislate? We have, he says, one world, but `one world without government'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The market system has no rules and is, in the end, a basic threat to democracy. In a democracy, one person equals one vote; in the market system, $1,000 equals 1,000 votes. National autonomy is also threatened by three movements: upwards towards supranational entities such as the EU; sideways toward bilateral arrangements or links with non-government organisations, NGOs, or international government organisations, IGOs; or downwards towards regionalism&mdash;autonomy for Scotland or Catalonia, for example.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the ending of the Cold War, there is a search for enemies within, and the rise of conspiracy theories. In the US in 1990, quite suddenly, communists ceased to be the main enemy and were replaced by practitioners of `political correctness'. Democracy and populism are confused, with appeals to emotion and fear, refusal to examine evidence or provide analysis. Propaganda displaces information, with growing emphasis on what Norman Davies&mdash;in his recent book entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Europe: A History</EMPHASIS>&mdash;calls the rule of simplification, `reducing all data to a simple confrontation between "Good and Bad", "Friend and Foe"'; and the rule of disfiguration, `discrediting the opposition by crude smears and parodies'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia suffers from leadership failure and lack of vision. In my brief tribute in the House to Isaiah Berlin on 24 November, I 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12257"> referred to his 1953 book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Hedgehog and the Fox</EMPHASIS>, where he took up the words of the Greek poet Archilochus: `The fox knows many things and the hedgehog one big thing.' Berlin was a fox, so are Whitlam, Evans, Hawke, Keating and Beazley&mdash;and, in my own limited way, I suppose, myself. Each reacted to new experiences and insights by taking them up and adapting them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this analysis, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is the classic hedgehog. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New Columbia Encyclopedia</EMPHASIS> states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When frightened a hedgehog rolls itself into a tight ball with its spines pointing outward; when rolled up it is invulnerable to almost any predator.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Prime Minister reacts like a hedgehog to external challenge in areas that he feels uncomfortable about, whether it is Wik, global climate change, what he calls, but does not define, `political correctness', or confronting darker elements of our history. The one exception where he showed decisive leadership qualities was in gun control, an area where he received total support from the opposition and Democrats. I was also grateful for his support for Australia's continued membership of UNESCO.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At a time of psychological stress in the community, there is a risk that major issues in economics and history will not be given serious debate, and this may lead to grossly oversimplified stereotyping. The past can be fantasised both by advocates of the cheer squad or what is attacked as the `black armband' view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some nations have adopted the position of refusing to recognise, let alone respond to, unpleasant aspects in the national record, calling it a `black armband' view of history. Switzerland was in denial about its close collaboration with Nazi Germany and the disposal of Jewish gold; Japan censored, and indeed still censors, textbooks which expose atrocities in China and Japan; France suffered collective amnesia about the wartime occupation record until Jacques Chirac let in some light in 1995. This suggests a failure of nerve and compassion and the loss of a moral base for government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In Australia, the idea of a national apology to Aborigines because of past cruelties and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> misjudgments led to strong government resistance and a complete failure of empathy. There was a confusion between guilt and shame, two very different concepts. The converse of guilt is innocence; the converse of shame is pride.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister has attacked the habit of introspection; that is, examining one's own thoughts. As you can see, a very dangerous practice! An uneasiness about close or critical scrutiny of Australian history or our own political processes seems to be closely related to attacks on the independence and adequate funding of the ABC and well&hyphen;publicised concern that the Fairfax papers were `out of control' and `too liberal', needing the discipline of a more profit oriented ownership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The political backlash to the dramatic changes of the 1980s was a long time coming, but the swing against Labor in the March 1996 election was severe. One of the most important, but unrecognised, themes of the One Nation Party is the rejection of intellectual leadership, elitism and professional knowledge. The honourable member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) has coined a great phase: if she wants to dismiss evidence or statistics, she says, `That's just a book fact.' Department of immigration statistics on Asian migration? Only book facts. 1996 census returns on Australian residents of Asian origin?  More book facts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Hanson phenomenon feeds on a deep sense of alienation, with its appeal to the politics of nostalgia, reassurance, and the world of childhood and simplicity, offering simple explanations for complex phenomena. She is a symptom, not a cause. The honourable member for Oxley echoes the world, with some honourable exceptions, of talkback radio. Words can be used as bullets and they can cause instant damage&mdash;damage that can take years to be repaired. It is a gross misuse of the principle of free speech to insist on the right to attack but not to accept accountability for damage done. Target groups are demonised, ignorance is regarded as a strength, questions are answered with slogans or opportunistic appeals to patriotism. The right of free speech is a very precious natural right and must be preserved at all costs. However, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12258"> the right to be taken seriously has to be earned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's response to the challenge of global warming and the issues being raised right now at the Kyoto conference have been profoundly depressing. While Europe, the US and Japan are all agreed on containing emission standards, Australia engages in special pleading. We say that, if we were expecting CO2 emission increases of 28 per cent by the year 2010, and are now proposing to cut it down to 18 per cent, that should be considered as a significant reduction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The saddest thing is the failure of the government to grasp that the whole pattern of energy use world wide is likely to change dramatically in the next 20 years. Australia is putting most of its money on coal because we are still bemused by the concept of comparative advantage&mdash;that if we did not have the coal, where would we be? We take no interest in energy efficiency because we see that as being against the national interest. Energy waste? Now that is a different matter. We'll drink to that. We are in grave danger of making the same mistake that Telecom made years ago, when communications providers were moving to optical fibre&mdash;that is, internationally&mdash;which is a silica based technology. Australia's response was to say, `We have no comparative natural advantage in silica, but we do have it in copper. Let's concentrate on coaxial copper cables.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I talk to people in industry about the huge opportunities which will arise in energy efficient devices over the next 20 years, I am often told, `Why don't we leave it to the Swedes? They can do that. We'll concentrate on the coal; they can concentrate on energy efficiency.' How extraordinary that, when ABARE was doing its computer modelling for the government about alleged `worst case' scenarios if we adopted international greenhouse gas abatement targets, only organisations which paid an up-front fee of $50,000 were allowed to help design the model. Not surprisingly, the coal industry was up front; the environment movement was absolutely nowhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Universities and other research bodies, notably CSIRO, are now increasingly depend 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ent on market forces. If knowledge did not produce a product, what was its use? Lawyers, doctors, dentists, accountants, and MBAs were assumed to have a value. But linguists, historians, philosophers, classicists, musicologists, archaeologists, theologians? Forget it. The retreat of the academies, fearful of offending sponsors and perhaps unsure of their own non-economic value, has seriously diminished the quality of debate in Australia. On paper we have never been so well educated. But is this reflected in the quality of our public discourse?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This phenomenon that I have been talking about, the retreat from reason, is not confined to Australia. In the US, powerful, rich and well educated, a significant minority repudiated the open society, mainstream politics and sceptical detachment, leading to the revival of fundamentalism and a growing conviction that government itself was the enemy. This led to what has been called `the revenge of the powerless'. It is striking how many popular films and television series show the US government acting brutally and deceptively against the interests of its citizens&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Rock</EMPHASIS>, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mission: Impossible</EMPHASIS>, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The X-Files</EMPHASIS>, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Millennium</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Dark Skies</EMPHASIS> all illustrate that view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">California, oddly, links very high levels of formal education with extraordinary credulity and suggestibility, illustrated by the mass suicide of members of the Heaven's Gate cult at the time that the Hale-Bopp comet appeared. The Pathfinder landing on Mars coincided with the 50th anniversary of the alleged Roswell, New Mexico, invasion by aliens. To many US citizens, Roswell may have seemed more real.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Czech President, Vaclav Havel, has referred to a `loss of transcendence', the decline of an overarching belief system which makes sense of the contemporary world, contributing to the rise of cults committed to a conspiratorial or apocalyptic view, with cult members seeing themselves as victims, leading to an absolute commitment to a cause or leader of the world, all too often including the use of killing and terror as ideological instruments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope that parliament and the whole political process, including the parties, will play a central role in promoting the ethos of democ 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="12259"> racy. However, a revival of the political process will not just depend on parties, parliaments and voting. It will require more use of intermediate bodies, including churches, trade unions, environmentalists and business groups; a fearless judiciary; stronger and more diverse media and research communities; and the encouragement of knowledge, analysis, scepticism, transparency, curiosity and understanding. A revolution in education will be needed to redefine values, as well as a critical spirit, with heavier emphasis on history, philosophy, English and foreign languages. The election of a Beazley Labor government in 1998 or 1999 will be an essential first step.</PARA>

I am reliably informed that the Senate is now well advanced in its consideration of the native title amendment legislation, and we are hopeful that it may conclude its deliberations around 6 o'clock.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, it is my proposal to have the House here and available to receive that material from the Senate so that the issues can be dealt with. I am proposing that the House will have an extended evening meal break from 6 p.m. to 8.30 p.m. We can then resume on the appropriation legislation which is currently before the House. As there are quite a number of speakers on the appropriation bills, that could last for some time. We would hope to get the appropriation bills finished by the end of this evening. Even though it is a long list, there might be some who would drop off, so we would see ourselves concluding the debate. There are two other bills which could then be brought on, even if not concluded, tonight. We could then also have an extended adjournment, which we have done in the past, for an hour or so&mdash;so that, if anybody has anything that they finally want

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to consider this situation seriously. I understand the position that is being put. But it is now almost 5.30 p.m. and, if this is to be a 10-hour exercise and we assume the worst, we will not get onto this Wik legislation until a significantly later stage tonight. The other thing we need to know in terms of forming a judgment on this issue is how long the government intends to go in responding to what comes back from the Senate. Is it intended to keep the Senate standing by for what is determined in this chamber?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not just an exercise of all of us progressing this matter. All of us want to get home. All of us have commitments, and all of us know the importance of this particular piece of legislation. But it is very difficult for us to respond in a sensible manner if we are given no notice of what is now before us, if we have changed arrangements in terms of the procedure associated with the paperwork, and if we have no indication of what the government's intentions are when it comes back in here as to how it handles the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We really need to have a sensible assessment of that. If the Leader of the House is not in a position to advise us of that now, it would seem to me to make sense that we adjourn now so that a dinner break can be held.

I am suggesting that we go through to 8.30 p.m in order to have a civilised break for dinner.

They are in the situation where Aboriginal people they call outsiders, particularly, for instance, from Brisbane, are claiming land in Far North Queensland that traditional people have lived on for many years and believe to be their land. Some of these things need to be looked at very closely to see that this act is not working and is causing divisions even within the Aboriginal community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The area of title is very complex. There are many leaders in the Aboriginal community, particularly the more prominent ones, who are preferring to fight these things through the courts. The reason they are doing that is they believe they will somehow get a greater win out of this. When you talk to prominent legal people who have come before the committee and asked questions, they say that if this is to be done by case law it can take 30 years to 50 years to try to clarify some of the issues that have been raised by the High Court decision. I do not think this country can afford to wait 30 to 50 years to clarify some of this law. It will not do anyone in this country any good, including Aboriginal people. So there is a necessity to try to clarify some of this law. This particular amendment has been moved in the native title debate:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5A After section 11</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Insert:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">11A Extinguishment of native title on freehold land.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2(b)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> where a grant of land registered as freehold title is made by the Crown in any capacity to the Crown, or to a statutory authority of the Crown, in any capacity . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That amendment is saying that, if that land had been registered as freehold by the Crown, extinguishment of native title would not be necessarily granted. If we look very closely at some of the developments around the country, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12262"> we can see the danger of that position. For instance, a situation has been brought to my attention of a very major development in Brisbane. Admiralty Towers Stage II development is a 36-storey, 189 unit tower which was completed in 1997. It comprises 106 two&hyphen;bedroom units, 77 three&hyphen;bedroom units, and eight penthouse units, plus basement parking for 260 cars over three levels. The building also includes two pools and gymnasium and recreation areas&mdash;one in the high rise and one in the low rise sections. Stage I of the development, on property 27, was completed towards the end of 1995. The combined total project cost was $155 million&mdash;a very major development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The title, if we look very closely at it, is rather interesting. Properties 24 and 27&mdash;then defined differently&mdash;giving a total site area of approximately 5,620 square metres, together with map 19 property 5, were bought for $11,700,000 in June 1987 by Seymour Developments. Properties 24 and 27, as they were then defined, reverted to the Crown in January 1988. A special lease was issued to Ariadne subsidiary Seymour Developments Pty Ltd, which later changed its name to Adnam Pty Ltd. This is a lease which was reverted to the Crown and then was leased back to the developer, even though it supposedly was bought under freehold conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1994, Seymour CBD entered into a new special lease of this property together with the area shown on the map. This leasehold was transferred to Seymour (Admiralty Towers) Pty Ltd in March 1995. Only part of the transfer was officially recorded, being $5,200,000 for lot 902. The freehold of this property was to have been acquired for $6,500,000 on completion of stage II of the apartment tower. This shows just how complex some of these areas are. When we get people trying to fiddle with a complex issue that has been gone through very carefully by the government to see that some of these issues can be clarified it really does show the problems that can arise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The same situation occurred in New South Wales. Something like $80 million has been expended and we have had one claim settled. I will go through that claim fairly carefully 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> because the House should be interested in what happened there. I happened to be Minister for Lands in New South Wales at the time that the first approaches were made by the local council to develop that particular piece of Crown land. They wanted me to supply to the council free of charge Crown land so they could develop it for residential. I naturally said no, because the land belonged to the state. I said that I would sell it to them for the market value at the time. They replied that they could not afford that total value.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we subsequently entered into an agreement that the land would be supplied by the state, the local council would develop it and, after development, the profits that were made would be shared by the state and the local council. What happened was the circumstances of history: the 1994 act intervened before the land had been converted from crown land to freehold; the council had developed part of the land and sold off the blocks; and people had built houses and units on that particular land. Technically, they did not own the land because it had not been converted to freehold and had been claimed by the Aboriginal people under the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We say this was a settlement, but it really was not a settlement. Some people tend to criticise the Aboriginal people for the fact that it was sold very quickly. I have to say to you: it does not matter which government was in power in New South Wales, that had to be dealt with because it was a problem between the jurisdictions of the state government and the law that had been passed by the federal government. I do not classify that as a settlement. Undoubtedly, negotiations took place, but really the whole issue had to be resolved because of the fact that those people had claimed the land, rightly, under the federal act, yet the land had been sold to people who built houses and units on it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is where you have to be very careful in this whole area when you start to move amendments&mdash;politically based many of them&mdash;and not understand the full ramifications of what is going on here. This is a very difficult process. I think it has to be treated as such in this parliament.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12263">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to talk, under  Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1997&hyphen;98 , about some forest issues in New South Wales, particularly the federal government's involvement in the national forest policy and the negotiations that are taking place at the present time under forestry. As the honourable member at the table, the honourable member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson), would understand, I have had a longstanding interest in forestry from my involvement in the New South Wales parliament. I think I do understand it a little bit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The facts are that, with all the rhetoric that is being put forward at the present time about a better, a more value adding and a more competitive forest industry in Australia, what we are seeing&mdash;particularly in New South Wales&mdash;is the closing down of the forest industry. There is no doubt that the state government of the day, the Carr government at  present, is using the national forest policy to do that. If you look very closely at the actions and procedures that were put in place by the previous Labor government in Canberra&mdash;and carried on by this government&mdash;for a national forest policy and adequate reserves being put in place, the whole area is being distorted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bob Carr has made promises that he is going to go out there and declare wilderness areas and national parks regardless. The fact is that he is not taking into consideration some of the key points in the national forest policy and, in particular, the socioeconomic effects on small regional centres that the policy is going to have if he continues down this track.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The interim forest policy was such that areas would be set aside to be investigated, that we would have a close look at the science involved to decide whether the areas were needed to be set aside for those reasons&mdash;because we were saying in the national forest policy that we should endeavour to preserve 15 per cent of species and that areas of special significance should be set aside. I do not think anyone had any problems with that, particularly under the guidelines at that time when we were looking at larger areas&mdash; 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">we were looking at five or six areas across Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what has happened is that, because the greenies have absolute control of the New South Wales government, these areas have now been split up into smaller areas. They are ignoring the reserves that are already in place; they are ignoring reserves of species that are already there. The whole process has been distorted to the extent that I believe on the far north coast of New South Wales, where my electorate of Page is, we could have 60 per cent of the forest resource locked up under these plans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That has severe repercussions for small country towns. Areas up on the Queensland border like Woodenbong, Urbenville and Bonalbo&mdash;small country villages with a few hundred people in them&mdash;depend exclusively on forest industries and grazing. If this process is allowed to continue, then we will see the demise of those particular towns. I do not think that is what we need in Australia, particularly when we are importing $3 billion worth of forest products into this country. It is an absolute disgrace that we are allowing this to continue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt in my mind that we have to draw Bob Carr back to the national forest policy. We have to say to him that we are not going to continue to go down this track, that we are going to take into account the socioeconomic effects of these policies. The Prime Minister has clearly said, after a number of members of this government made representations to him, that if the 15 per cent of pre-1750 species was going to have an effect on small communities, then he believed it should be in some way amended to show that these people would not be destroyed by these policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem with all of this is that the whole process is being developed on a lie&mdash;a lie that has been peddled extensively by the environment movement; a lie that always seems to curry favour with the media. But the fact is that Australian forests today are probably better forests than they were when Europeans first came to this country. When you talk about the 15 per cent of 1750, we have no documentation of what the forests were in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12264"> 1750. But if you go extensively through the journals of the old explorers, almost universally you will find the explorers talking about open woodland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of the forests we have today did not exist. In fact, the pilliga scrub, which has been in the news in the last two days because of the severe fires, did not exist before Europeans&mdash;it was open grassland. The only reason the top end of the Clarence, where the famous Yugilbar station, a big cattle station, used to stand, was settled was that it was open grassland. It was open grassland because Aborigines used fire regularly and extensively and the trees did not grow in those areas&mdash;they were burnt at a very young age and did not exist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first explorers up the Hunter River reported seeing grasslands for 20 miles each side of the river. They are not the types of forest that the greenies are now telling us existed across Australia. I think we have to get to some of the facts. Our country's foresters were very proud scientists. Undoubtedly mistakes had been made in the past&mdash;of course there had&mdash;but these people were very efficient managers of the forests and they could provide a resource on a sustainable basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard time and again right throughout this debate that we are closing down these forests because of overcutting of forests. The government and particularly the greenies like to accuse the previous New South Wales coalition government, of which I was the minister responsible for forests, of overcutting the forests, but they neglect to say they made that assessment after another national park was declared. A percentage of the area available to the industry has been locked away. They look at the Crown quotas for timber and say, `This is terrible because you have this Crown quota but you now do not have the resource to provide it.' Of course we do not&mdash;because it has been locked away. That is the great lie that gets peddled right across the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people of Australia have to start waking up to this fact because it is having very severe effects on our national economy. As I mentioned earlier, $3 billion worth of product 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is imported into this country and our country is selling something like $700,000 worth of product. So there is a huge deficit in forest products in this country&mdash;and there need not be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our plantations are not the panacea. The greenies like to paint them as being the ultimate answer because it sounds sexy to the city. They say, `You don't have to cut down the forests. You can grow plantations.' I challenge anyone to get into an aeroplane at Eden and look under them as they fly to Coolangatta. They will see very little land available on which forests can be planted. Don't tell me that knocking down the forests that are already there to grow plantations will be allowed, because that is not going to happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I was a minister in the New South Wales government I did a study on this subject, and I have to say the policy is flawed. There is no doubt that plantations can augment the natural resource we have&mdash;and they should&mdash;but land on which we could grow forests is not there. Some greenies have the audacity to say we should grow them at Moree. Why do you think trees do not grow there at present? Because the rainfall and climate are just not suitable for growing them in that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem we have with this plantation policy is that, first of all, it takes 15 years to get the first thinnings. Who has the money to carry on with no cashflow for 15 years? Then of course we have to find something to use the thinnings for. They are not good for milling. They are too small. There needs to be a chip or pulp industry. But the greenies say we cannot have that. So how do we get this resource up to mill log size? Even if we do&mdash;as we have seen at the APM plantation at Coffs Harbour which was planted by private industry for the pulp industry&mdash;there are koalas in the plantations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The New South Wales government have not yet come up with legislation&mdash;and they have been promising it for some time&mdash;that can adequately protect investment in plantations. The absence of a policy that can adequately protect an investment means we will not get 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12265"> any. Obviously people have seen exactly what has happened in this debate in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also concerned about the FISAP process that is being developed in New South Wales. This process has been put in place to retrain and relocate workers and also to help industry either get out of the industry&mdash;and that is an admission in itself&mdash;or upgrade some of those processes. There seems to be a divide and conquer attitude. People are being forced out of the industry with no compensation. Workers are being forced out of the industry with no compensation. A few people are gaining, but quite a number of people are losing. Quite frankly, I think the whole process is flawed in the way it is being managed. I think the New South Wales government need to look very closely at that process because it will come back and bite them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been no research into what value adding there should be. In New South Wales everyone seems to have said, `There is a pot of gold out there being supplied by both the federal and state governments. Let's go out and dip our fingers into it.' So everyone is value adding in the same way and there is a surplus of that particular product on the market at present. No-one has done the research to see whether there will be a market for that product. Now we see that one of the major mills at Walcha, New South Wales, Fennings, which has been a long time player in this industry, is about to close. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The appropriation bills that we are debating tonight give us the opportunity to look at expenditure that the government is proposing in a number of specific areas. Tonight I want to talk about industry policy and also to make a few remarks about small business. In the first instance, industry policy or the lack thereof coming from the government is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12266"> reflected by the fact that, after several inquiries and after many months of deliberation at cabinet level, it is only going to be next Monday, after the parliament rises for three months, that we will see the government announce its response to those industry reports and bring down some semblance of an industry policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was staggered last week, when the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) was asked a question about the steel industry and the future of a report that had been done by a bipartisan committee on the steel industry, that he remarked that he had no intention of responding to it. As a representative of the Illawarra and of the steel industry in this nation, I could not believe his response. It says plenty about the qualities of the particular member who occupies the position of minister for industry in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite frankly, if there is one glaring omission in this government's approach to looking at the ways in which the unemployment rate can be brought down&mdash;a glaring omission that has been in place for all the 20 to 21 months that they have been in government&mdash;it is their failure to address an industry policy; it is their failure to address a manufacturing policy; and it is their failure to address the difficulties in the steel industry in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much has been said about Newcastle and, yes, it is true that BHP have taken a decision that they will no longer manufacture steel in Newcastle in about two years time. But that does not mean that BHP are not going to have a future in Newcastle, because they are. Steel products such as wire, rod and bar will continue to be manufactured in Newcastle. Some 500&hyphen;odd employees will still have jobs in that city. But, of course, it will not replace those 2,000 to 3,000 other jobs that will be lost directly because steel will no longer be manufactured there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I just share this with the House: some two weeks before BHP made their announcement about Newcastle, the general manager of the Port Kembla steelworks gathered all the community leaders of the Illawarra in the Church of Christ  hall in Wollongong&mdash;and there was some symbolism about that, I 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> think&mdash;to tell us that the steel industry in the Illawarra was in for another bout of rationalisation. The term `rationalisation' is code for further unemployment of steel workers. As we have now seen through BHP's announcements, there has been rationalisation of not only those on the shop floor&mdash;many of whom have been replaced by technology anyway&mdash;but also of middle management and technical people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have seen in the steel industry in Wollongong is that, from 1983, a steel industry work force directly employed by BHP of some 26,000 people has shrunk to what it is today&mdash;6,800. On the estimates given by BHP, a shrinkage of a further 2,000 in the coming 12 to 18 months is a distinct possibility. Productivity is up, yes; investment in technology is through the roof, yes&mdash;and I commend BHP for doing that. But I would also point out that BHP striving to achieve an output of 1,000 tonnes per man per year comes with a cost. That cost is the employment of people in Wollongong and, more broadly, in the Illawarra region. The downstream effect that that has is also quite significant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When these sorts of issues were brought to the attention of the minister for industry last year&mdash;when people were talking about the future of Newcastle and whether it would survive; when people were talking about Whyalla; when people were talking about the new steel production capacity in Western Australia&mdash;it was the Labor Party that said strategic intervention may well be necessary in the steel industry again to develop a second steel industry plan, such as the one that we developed within 100 days of coming to government in 1983. That steel industry plan in 1983 actually saved the steel industry in this country. Many people have forgotten that that is the case. Many people have forgotten that it was a tripartite arrangement between the government, who played a very small role, the union movement and management in saving the steel industry. The simple fact was that BHP were quite happy to continue with minerals, oil, gas and overseas developments and to walk away from steel production at the time. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12267">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to give consideration to the fact that we are again faced with retrenchments in the steel industry. We are faced with smaller operations, starting with mini&hyphen;mills in different parts of Australia, that are largely geared up for local consumption. After these concerns were brought to the attention of the minister, the government finally&mdash;dragged kicking and screaming by BHP, the unions and the Labor Party&mdash;decided to do something about it and asked a bipartisan committee of this place to examine the steel industry. That report was produced with the assistance of the minister's own department and officials and was given to him some months ago. The minister's response to that report, when asked about it last week in the parliament, was to tell the people of Newcastle, Wollongong and Whyalla that he had no intention of responding to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We shake our heads in Wollongong about the attitude that this government displays to our region. We shake our heads at the fact that we can see that within 20 months of government the Liberal Party has shut down an Immigration office in Wollongong, where there are over 80 ethnic nationalities represented. In an area where close to 50 of people come from overseas countries and are of a non&hyphen;English speaking background, they shut an Immigration office down! They have got the Commonwealth office block up for sale, like most other things. They have obliterated the CES and DEETYA and the other organisations which provided real assistance to people in the Illawarra. The Medicare office in Corrimal, which is opposite my electorate office, shut down on 7 November. The one in the electorate of my friend and colleague the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) shut down at the same time, leaving two Medicare offices now for the entire Wollongong area. This is the contempt which this government has for people of the Illawarra. What has been their sin? They have returned Labor members to the federal parliament and to the state parliament. That is the sin of the people of the Illawarra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I return to industry policy. As we know, on Monday the minister&mdash;or the Prime Minister (Mr Howard)&mdash;is intent on announcing the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government's response to the Mortimer committee report and a number of others in respect of industry policy. A few strategic leaks have occurred over the last couple of days. One is in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph</EMPHASIS> of Thursday, 4 December under the headline `Steel City hits back'. I thought, `You beaut, they are talking about Wollongong.' But, alas, it was not; it was Newcastle. Under the headline it says, `Duty free plan to create 2,000 jobs.' And the article talks about this concept that has been pushed for some time to give, as is explained in this article, `a first industrial estate in which factories making goods for export won't pay duty on imported components'. It is this trade free or free trade zone that people have been talking about.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable members that have had some experience in this place&mdash;unlike the member for Dawson&mdash;would recognise that places such as the Northern Territory and Darwin, in particular, experienced an approach to industry policy very similar to the one that is being advocated here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If it is true that as part of the industry statement on Monday, the Prime Minister or the minister for industry&mdash;it is actually the Prime Minister according to this report&mdash;is going to respond to the Mortimer review, the Goldsworthy report and a number of other inquiries that have been undertaken into industry policy, and if indeed they are going to announce this concept of a trade free zone or some import duty relaxation zone for the city of Newcastle, then, if that announcement is made on Monday and this becomes part of the policy of this government to ensure that those sorts of zones will be created around Australia, Illawarra is No. 2 on Tuesday. And I suspect Geelong will be No. 3 on Wednesday. I suspect that western Sydney will come along on Thursday. I suspect that western Melbourne will come along on Friday, and on and on it will go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope that that is right. I hope that there will be some incentives provided to industry in this country. I would hope that the people that have been decimated by the policies of this government already in the Illawarra will 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12268"> get some benefit for some industry policy and a bit of leadership out of this minister for industry because, when he is asked questions in this place, it is all he can do to struggle from his seat to get to the microphone to turn around and say nothing. That is the way he treats people with legitimate questions in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it does not stop there. Another issue that has been brought to my attention in respect of the combined areas of small business&mdash;and I am delighted to see the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) here&mdash;and industry policy relates to the issue of the Australian Made campaign and also to the idea of origin labelling that has been brought forward by the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs (Mr Truss). I have received, as have my colleague the member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson) and my colleague the member for Hotham (Mr Crean), some considerable correspondence from Mr Kevin Chambers, who is the Managing Director of Kevron Plastics Pty Ltd.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you start to read this letter and start to understand some of the concerns he has, you have to stop to think that he has got a few points, given the fact that he also specifies that he is a long&hyphen;term Liberal voter and that he is particularly concerned about the way in which the use of the Australian Made logo has now fallen into disrepute and the fact that the licensing arrangement, which is operational in respect of that Australian Made logo, is also under question as to what its future is going to be. This is the case  because, for a measly $2 million a year, the Howard government has cut funding for the Australian Made campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All these people like the member for Dawson and others on the other side go around Australia saying, `We must have Australian Made. We must look after Australian producers.' She sits up there in cockies corner and then sells out the sugar industry. She sells out the tourism industry with the reef tax. On and on it goes. Then she says, `Hang on, I support Australian jobs and I support Australian manufacturers.' And here is a case in point: a lousy $2 million a year and it was cut; and the Australian Made campaign fell over.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Mr Chambers points out in his letter to me, he actually had the opportunity to raise this with the Minister for Small Business and Workplace Relations recently at a breakfast that he attended in Melbourne. A product had come in with Made in Australia labelling on it, but on the inside it showed it was made in India. Mr Chambers, who has been running a bit of a campaign on this in Melbourne, decided he would raise it with the Minister for Small Business and Workplace Relations. He said that he showed it to Mr Reith but that  unfortunately he, the minister, had expressed little interest in taking the matter further. He said that when the new Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs, Mr Truss, was asked about this on a radio interview he said he would look into it a little further. But then he got on to talk about origin labelling and said that by the end of this year&mdash;that is, 1997&mdash;there would be some announcements made about that. Mr Chambers has also written in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">National Business Bulletin</EMPHASIS> of December 1997 about this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The whole point of the comments being made is that under the concept of Australian Made, encouraging people to buy Australian products to give our kids a job&mdash;and we always know that people in this place on both sides of the chamber like to say, `Buy the kids a job and get the unemployed young people off the dole and into something'&mdash;for a measly $2 million this thing could have been given further legs. And it has not. What has happened now is that there are something like 2,000 licensees with this product. Everybody knows what it is: a little green triangle with a yellow kangaroo in the middle. It is a terrific symbol. I remember we started the program. Little badges were handed out, and people on both sides of the chamber were running around with these little badges and promoting Australian Made all over their electorate. All of a sudden, the government changes; you mob come in and say, `This is not a very good idea. Two million dollars: we will save that in the budget.'</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12269"> licensees, genuine small businesses and large businesses who are accredited because they go through a testing procedure and are given this licence to advertise Australian Made product&mdash;there is a check made on them and the ACCC is given responsibility under the Trade Practices Act to ensure that those products are Australian made&mdash;do not know where they are anymore. The licensees are in limbo. They are in limbo because the Howard government, for the want of saving a couple of bucks here and there, decided that the Australian Made campaign was not worth the effort. ACCI, a private organisation subsequently given the responsibility for running this particular program, again is not forthcoming with funding for it or indeed any concept as to how it is to work in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I simply reiterate what I said earlier. Here you have a classic small business person, a classic, as he describes himself `Liberal Party voting small business person', who is disgusted with the attitude of the incumbent government in their approach to an Australian Made campaign that he has been championing. He has been championing it because he is a manufacturer himself&mdash;a small businessman who wants to get on, make Australian made products, be proud of it being made in Australia and giving kids a job, as the slogan went. It has not happened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this demonstrates is the fact that this is a mean&hyphen;spirited, penny&hyphen;pinching government that does not care for the ordinary people of Australia, the people that the Prime Minister talks about as being mainstream Australians. He does not care that people who are part of his own constituency now are saying that this government has lost the plot. In industry policy, in nursing home policy&mdash;in any policy you care to name&mdash;this is a government that has lost the plot. It is regrettable that a government, having succeeded in the election to the extent that it did, has squandered an opportunity in 20 months. To be at the stage that this government is, is extraordinary. I have been in this place only 13 years, but I have studied politics for a lot longer.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the amendments be disagreed to.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The government has no alternative but to reject the Senate amendments to the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R269">Public Service Bill 1997</XREF> , the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R270">Public Employment (Consequential and Transitional) Amendment Bill 1997</XREF>  and the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R360">Parliamentary Service Bill 1997</XREF> . I am deeply disappointed at the actions of the Senate. Significant legislative reform in this area is vital. Throughout the development of these bills, the government has shown a willingness to seek reasonable compromise and bipartisan support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister Peter Reith and I met directly with groups of administrative service officers around the country. We negotiated for many hours with public sector unions, agreeing to more than 30 changes to the original proposals. I then introduced amendments in parliament to take account of each one of the 20 unanimous recommendations of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is disappointing, but not surprising, that many of the Labor amendments are at odds with the Public Service reforms promised by Labor in 1995. Kim Beazley, when Minister for Finance, foreshadowed:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Australian Public Service will be integrated into . . . the broader Australian community . . . Commercialisation of government activities will continue. Competition will become a commonplace, in some cases through privatisation . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Labor minister, Gary Johns, urged that the APS `be placed on a similar footing to the private sector' and `proposed that secretaries and agency heads be given employment powers in their own rights'. The Labor Party when in government recognised that unrestricted appeal rights were a major barrier to performance. Minister John Dawkins an 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="12276"> nounced in May 1984 that there would be no promotion appeals for the Senior Executive Service. Similarly, in October 1986 Minister Ralph Willis removed promotion appeal rights for senior officers, arguing:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is not appropriate for an external body . . . to be substituting its view for that of departmental management as to who is best suited to do the job.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Yet Senator Faulkner, through his actions, now seeks to introduce such appeal rights. He also suggests that his party would only be willing to support regulations providing for Australian workplace agreements in the APS for certain categories of employment in certain circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is not going to have its Australian Public Service employment arrangements subject to the fickle moods of the opposition and minor parties in the Senate. The ALP has introduced more than 50 amendments in the Senate. Together they would return the APS to the past, burying employment actions in layers of unnecessary prescription. The Senate's actions have prevented the government from placing the values, standards and conduct necessary for an apolitical and impartial Australian Public Service on a statutory basis for the first time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is now unable to remove age discrimination, protect Public Service whistleblowers, provide a separate and independent parliamentary service or place limitations on ministerial involvement in employment decisions. This is unfortunate. But it will not weaken the government's resolve, nor will we slacken the pace of Public Service reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The devolution of management decision making is already being achieved under the Workplace Relations Act. The process of reform is now to be accelerated. All secretaries will be expected to finalise Australian workplace agreements with their senior executives in the near future, and the majority of secretaries will have concluded making certified agreements with their staff by the middle of next year. At the same time, the government will now proceed administratively with a number of the proposed legislative reforms. I have today instructed the Public Service Commissioner to issue directions to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> all agency heads to set in place many of the initiatives required for a modern Public Service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course I am disappointed for those many public servants who had eagerly anticipated legislative reform. I well understand their frustrations at working under an act which is 75 years old and has had to be patched up more than 100 times. I assure them that the government will not waiver in its commitment to reform. The Australian Public Service is a great institution which the government of the day holds on trust. The coalition government is determined to do all that it can to ensure that it is handed on in a better shape to future governments. It is precisely for that reason that the government will not agree to amendments. It is now up to the Labor Party to seek common ground.</PARA></SPEECH>

But no, what we want is a bit of a debate about a double dissolution trigger. We want to build up a bit of a back 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="12277"> log. We want to have a series of bills to legitimise tomorrow's stunt about double dissolution triggers so the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) can come in here and grandstand to his heart's content&mdash;not tonight, when we actually could do it, but tomorrow morning so that maybe the publicity will be a bit better. And we will not do it with that bill but with this bill and the unfair dismissal bill, the other triggers they are trying to build up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not about outcomes; it is about political posturing. It is not good policy. It is an absolute disgrace to pretend that you are doing this in the interests of developing a strong public service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For this government&mdash;of any government since Federation&mdash;to pretend that it is coming in here because its commitment is to public service, and to a strong, efficient public service, is the height of hypocrisy, Mr Deputy Speaker. It is absolutely breathtaking&mdash;and there are 22,000 sacked public servants who can testify to that. They talk often about people leaving the Public Service but, for those 22,000 Australians, the Public Service left them&mdash;and it left them in the lurch. And then the government says, `We are really about a strong public service, a coherent public service, except for those 22,000 and the others in the agencies'&mdash;I am talking here about mainstream public servants&mdash;when in fact what they are doing is tearing apart the great tradition of a career public service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are heading towards more differentiation and dissipating the cohesion, which will make change and restructuring more difficult because you will easily create a series of fiefdoms around the Public Service run by powerful agency heads who will be individually accountable only to their ministers and to whom individual public servants will be accountable. It is bad public service policy; it is against the long&hyphen;term interests of this country; it is particularly against the long&hyphen;term interests of those Australians in greatest need who most depend upon a strong, efficient, effective Public Service capable of delivering good policy and the efficient delivery of the services that flow from that good policy. It is against the interests of the employees.  </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My most profound concern with this bill is that the government's industrial relations agenda has got in the way of its public service agenda. Anything that pretends any longer that this is a bill about making the Public Service better is destroyed as soon as you analyse the fact that what it is really about is imposing the government's industrial relations agenda on public servants because they cannot get any sensible people in the private sector to take it up.

<PARA STYLE="Para">As I indicated in my remarks a few moments ago, the government is not prepared to agree to the amendments made by the Senate which will take the Australian Public Service backwards. The opposition and Democrat senators who spoke in the Senate debate have indicated that they support reforms to remove the restrictions that bind the Public Service in red tape and which prevent it from operating efficiently, yet in the rhetoric that the various speakers used, and in the proposals that they have made, I have not found the slightest indication that they either understood the need for reform or appreciated what the nature of those reforms should be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say it was very disappointing to hear the empty and hypocritical rhetoric from the member for Canberra (Mr McMullan) just a few moments ago.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;By 40,000. All this shows is just how empty and misconceived your rhetoric is. The changes that the Senate has made to the bill reflect a political process which has caused so much difficulty for this country, because it is a process in which there is a surrender to narrow sectional interests. The Labor Party is the voice of those narrow sectional interests. It has put their interests above the public interests, and it is seeking to place itself as an obstacle in the pathway of proper and appropriate reform to the Public Service. In some cases, reforms which the Labor Party itself supported in office it has now attempted to reverse in the Senate. And it is that empty opportunism, it is that shallow political attitude to this legislation which is so deeply disappointing to those who have committed themselves to a very substantial and major reform which will improve conditions for members of the Public Service and improve service to the wider Australian community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments in the Senate do no more than attempt to reintroduce the rigidities and inefficiencies that lie at the heart of the problems being faced by the Australian Public Service. They focus on process, not on outcomes; they look to the past and not to the future. The opposition and the Democrats seek to regulate and proscribe, to control from the centre, and to ensure that whatever flexibilities the government is attempting to provide to agency heads and their employees are removed or thwarted. They seek rigid, mandated service&hyphen;wide processes that do not provide the capacity for public servants to tailor their operations to the work they perform or the needs of the clients they serve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the amendments that the Senate has proposed. The Senate amendments with which the government has most difficulty are those which prevent secretaries and agency heads from entering into an Australian workplace agreement&mdash;an AWA&mdash;with their employees unless the AWA covers a particular category of APS employees which has 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> been exempted from this provision by a regulation under the Public Service Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government does not support these amendments because they attempt to override the provisions of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 and place the APS on a different footing to the private sector. There is also a lack of clarity as to the operation of the clause. Other Senate amendments attempt to establish the primacy of awards and certified agreements over classification rules and determinations. The government does not accept the amendments because they are largely unnecessary or may be handled in other ways. To the extent that awards may cover matters contained in the classification rules, an award would override any rule that sought to diminish the provision in the award.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Department of Workplace Relations and Small Business will be making regulations under the Workplace Relations Act allowing agreements to displace agency head determinations to the extent of any inconsistency. With respect to determinations made by the public service minister, it is the intention that a special ministerial determination should be able to override agreements made under the Workplace Relations Act in the interests of the APS as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate has also sought to omit the provisions that the termination of employment provisions of the Workplace Relations Act will not apply to the termination of an SES employee, a secretary to a department or the head of an executive agency. The government does not accept these amendments because they treat these employees differently from their equivalents in the private sector and their counterparts in other public sectors in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another major concern for the government are those Senate amendments which attempt to establish the merit protection commissioner as an independent statutory agency and retain and expand the current tripartite appeals process. The government does not accept these amendments because they impose binding decisions on agency heads and unduly constrain their employment powers. The amendments would also indirectly continue the costly focus on process within agencies. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12279"> Furthermore, there are significant technical problems in the proposed amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further Senate amendments propose to move the definition of merit from clause 10, where it relates directly to the APS values, to clause 7, which sets out the definitions in the act. The amendments also change the definition, including the requirement for merit to be the sole consideration in a selection process rather than the primary consideration. The government does not accept these amendments. The original clause 10 provides a more workable definition than the Senate definition. The new reference to the sole consideration is more restrictive and may raise issues as to how this requirement interacts with other legislation and processes affecting employment decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government also has significant concerns with those Senate amendments which attempt to limit the powers of agency heads to engage persons as employees on other than a permanent basis and to transfer employees to other duties and locations. The government does not accept the amendments because they unnecessarily restrict the flexibility of agency heads to employ staff efficiently and economically to meet the needs of their agencies from time to time. There are also significant technical problems in relation to the application of the proposed provisions. Of a similarly limiting nature are those Senate amendments which place restrictions on the powers of agency heads to terminate employees. The government does not accept these amendments because they unnecessarily limit the exercise of termination powers and would contribute to the current emphasis on process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments, although presumably they seek to be comprehensive, preclude termination for other necessary reasons such as abandonment of employment or failure to complete a training course. They would also result in confusion in relation to the interaction of the grounds specified in the bill with those in the Workplace Relations Act. The Workplace Relations Act already protects employees by prohibiting termination on a number of grounds and by setting out procedural requirements as well as conciliation procedures and remedies.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another group of Senate amendments attempts to expand the coverage of the APS values and to require the Public Service Commissioner to issue directions in relation to each of the values rather than those which the commissioner deems appropriate. The government does not accept these amendments as the expansion of the values is unnecessary and confusing and because of the vagueness and lack of clarity in the proposed amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, the insertion of new subclause (j)(ii) is at odds with long established principles of remunerating APS employees and, because of its narrowness, would be at odds with Australian Industrial Relations Commission principles on wage fixation. With regard to the issue of directions, the commissioner should not have his or her functions unduly prescribed but should have the flexibility to decide when the issue of directions is appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A further group of amendments proposes to vary the provisions relating to breaches of the code of conduct, making them more prescriptive and less flexible. The government does not support these amendments because they unnecessarily restrict the flexibility of agency heads in dealing with breaches of the code of conduct and create technical problems with respect to their application. The Senate has also sought to prescribe the matters on which the Public Service Commissioner may issue directions in relation to SES employees and require certification by the commissioner prior to termination. The government does not accept the amendments, which propose unnecessary process in the legislation. The amendments are also unclear in their operation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, Senate amendments require annual reports prepared by the Public Service Commissioner, secretaries to departments and the heads of executive agencies to be prepared in accordance with guidelines approved by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit on behalf of the parliament. The government does not accept the amendments as they are unnecessarily prescriptive and hinder the intended flexibility in relation to the submission of annual reports to the parlia 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="12280"> ment, which is aimed at assisting a better alignment of key accountability and reporting mechanisms in respect of APS agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate has sought to require that the remuneration of the Public Service Commissioner, secretaries to departments and the heads of executive agencies&mdash;remuneration is to be determined by the Prime Minister or the agency minister, as the case may be&mdash;be set on the advice of the Remuneration Tribunal and published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS>. The government does not accept these amendments, because they are unnecessarily prescriptive. In practice the Remuneration Tribunal would be consulted and the remuneration range published in annual reports. The Senate has also sought to prescribe in greater detail the responsibilities of secretaries to departments. The government does not accept the amendment, because it is unnecessarily prescriptive and is uncertain in its operation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further Senate amendments relate to the establishment of executive agencies and the responsibilities, appointment and termination of heads of executive agencies. The amendments insert accountability requirements for executive agencies; prescribe in greater detail the responsibilities of heads of executive agencies, similar to the amendment in relation to secretaries to departments; and require the involvement of the secretary to the Prime Minister's department in the appointment and termination of the heads of executive agencies, rather than the relevant secretary, and the additional involvement of the Public Service Commissioner in a termination. The government does not accept these amendments as they are unnecessarily prescriptive. The accountability requirements in particular raise significant issues about the proposed operation of this amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A further Senate amendment proposes the omission of subclause 72(3), which specifies that the termination of employment provisions in the Workplace Relations Act do not apply to terminations of employees of agencies affected by machinery of government changes. The government does not accept this amendment as the removal of this subclause would potentially allow employees transferred under this clause access to the unlawful 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> termination provisions of the Workplace Relations Act, even though their employment continues by virtue of the operation of subclauses 72(1)(b) or (c).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The protections afforded by the Workplace Relations Act against unlawful termination are not justified in these circumstances as the termination is of a largely technical nature. Proposed replacement clause 72(3) would reduce the flexibility available under the Workplace Relations Act for both APS and non&hyphen;APS agencies to reach agreement with employees regarding the terms and conditions of employment for staff transferred to their agency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is also concerned with the proposed amendment which prevents the delegation of a power or function to a person who is not an APS employee or a statutory officer unless the Public Service Commissioner approves in writing the proposed delegation. The government does not accept this amendment, because it would cause considerable administrative inconvenience in requiring the commissioner's approval for such situations as Defence Force personnel, persons on secondment from other public services or contractors who may supervise APS employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate has proposed the insertion of an additional object in the act which the government requires or regards as quite unnecessary. The Senate has also inserted provisions for the recovery of additional remuneration from agency heads, the Public Service Commissioner and the Merit Protection Commissioner. The government does not accept this amendment because it adds unnecessary detail and prescription to the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker Reid, I am sure you will have noted and members will have noted that the most frequent verbs and nouns in this speech have been `prescribe' and `prescription'. That reflects the nature of the amendments proposed by the Senate. The common theme of these amendments is that they add unnecessary and ambiguous detail to the act and, through a culture of central control, seek to inhibit the ability of agency heads to manage their agencies efficiently and effectively for the benefit of their employees and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12281"> of the Australian people. The amendments look back fondly to a Public Service governed by rules and regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These amendments will be deeply disappointing to members of the Public Service who have worked so hard to achieve reforms. I know they will be deeply disappointing to members of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, such as the member for Kooyong (Mr Georgiou) who has worked so hard to put together a bill which could be acceptable to both sides of politics. They reflect the fact that the Labor Party has regrettably in this area&mdash;as in so many other areas in opposition as in government, but it is even more noticeable in opposition&mdash;made itself the mouthpiece for the relevant union. What we have here is the Labor Party walking away from its own reforms. It is now walking away from matters that it stood firmly on behalf of in government and matters which it championed in government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members of the public will ask themselves, `What does this tell us about the Australian Labor Party?' What it tells us is that the Labor Party is a party which is prepared to play shallow and shabby politics with one of the most important institutions in this country. It is a party which has no guiding principles. It is a party which is purely prepared to take shallow decisions without any vision for the future. It stands for nothing. It is the mouthpiece, the voice, of sectional interests, and that is deeply regrettable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Throughout this whole process the government has shown that it is prepared to work towards a compromise piece of legislation that will provide a framework for the present government and alternative governments. The Labor Party has not been prepared to accept this process. I deeply regret that. I believe that the detailed rebuttal that I have just provided of the amendments that have been made by the Senate give the lie to the claim by the member for Canberra that the government is simply seeking to politically posture in relation to this piece of legislation. Our objections to these amendments are substantial. That is why the government proposes that the bill now be set aside.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12282">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We did have a bit of an argument and we almost, Mr Deputy Speaker, got a little unruly, to your surprise and chagrin, I am sure, about the discussion concerning cuts to the Public Service. Nobody could deny that the previous government over 13 years made some tough decisions about the Public Service, and those of us who are members of parliament representing the ACT had to deal with those and we spoke to our constituents about it. I am happy to say they continued to vote for us, but I do not pretend that they enjoyed all of those decisions. They did not. They were critical of some.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But you cannot say that those things took place and that is an indication that we are similarly approaching this matter, when we had a reduction of over 40,000 in seven or eight years. On top of that, the coalition promised at the election that there would be only 2,500 Public Service jobs lost over three years. I said at the time that I thought there was a nought missing, and I was attacked by my opponent and others during the election that mine was an outrageous proposition. Once again, I am happy to say the good citizens of Canberra were wise enough to see through their ridiculous assertions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have found is that I was actually too modest; there was more than a nought missing. We have had more than 10 times the number of jobs lost in half the period. The rate has been 20 times that which the government said it would be at the election. It was double the rate that was occurring at the height of the previous government's tough decisions about the Public Service and building over and above all the decisions that were previously made&mdash;not in place of them, but over and above them. So let us just put that in some sort of perspective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One thing that did become clear in the minister's so&hyphen;called detailed rebuttal was that this is very much a bill about an industrial relations agenda in addition to some Public Service agenda. The opposition agrees with some of that, as is evident from the fact that some parts of the bill have not been amended. There were some matters out of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts with which we all agreed. So there are some matters of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Public Service reform we could deal with on a bipartisan basis if the government wished to, but they do not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A substantial amount of this bill is about changing the way in which industrial relations operates in the Public Service and not in a way that is likely to leave the Public Service better placed to serve the Australian people. It is simply using it as the advance guard for industrial relations changes the government would like to make and would like to see applying more widely but cannot get sensible employers and employees to agree to in the private sector. So they are seeking to use the Public Service as the advance guard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That has been done before. It was done a long time ago by a previous Labor government and, while I agreed with a number of the individual things they did, the consequences were not good. All I could say at the time is, `I told you so.' They listened as little then as some people did later, perhaps about as much as this minister will tonight. That is not a strategy which I recommend and it is an analogy which is becoming more and more apt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In reasonable consideration of the time&mdash;the time pressures on the House and the 10 minutes I have&mdash;I cannot possibly deal with all the amendments and the detailed rebuttal that the minister gave. It would, anyway, be quite pointless. It is appropriate for the government to put its point of view about all the amendments on the table because that is why it has moved the motion. All of them require detailed consideration either when it is reconsidered here in the consideration in detail stage or if and when it goes back to the Senate. But I did want to deal with some of the amendments because they go to some of the principles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One is the question of unfair dismissals. We have had a lot of debate in this place about unfair dismissals. I am happy to say the most outrageous debate about unfair dismissals occurred prior to the last election and I did not have to put up with it. But there has been quite a fair bit of debate in the period since March 1996. One of the things the government said was that its changes instituted a fair go all round; that this set of provisions was 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12283"> reasonable to both sides of the employment contract. Ironically, it is not a fair go that goes all the way round to the government's own employees, only to some of them. We do not think that is a fair, reasonable or appropriate way for the Commonwealth to deal with its own employees and we will continue not to support that. If the unfair dismissal provisions are to remain as they are, they ought to apply to the Commonwealth's employees across the board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not the time to go to great lengths, but I am very concerned about the proposal that&mdash;if I can paraphrase&mdash;the merit protection operations of the Commonwealth Public Service should in effect become an advisory function, should be like the Ombudsman, and provide a view to which people can say, `That is very interesting. I intend to take no notice.' That seems to me to be a profound problem. There is a lot more detail in it that one would want to talk about and we will talk about it in the consideration in detail stage here subsequently or in the Senate subsequently, but I am very concerned about that. I regard it as almost a derisory proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had a commentary about the definition of `merit'. I realise it is not easy, but the proposal in the opposition's amendments sounded pretty extraordinary and I thought I must have forgotten what it was, so I went back and checked. We are saying that merit is&mdash;and I quote only in part&mdash;`based on the relationship between an applicant's work&hyphen;related qualities and the work&hyphen;related qualities identified by the Agency as required for the job'. What an extraordinary definition. It is obviously very unreasonable that nobody should ever consider that merit should deal with the relationship between the qualities an individual has and the qualities identified as required for the job&mdash;in other words, excluding those matters that do not relate to the job requirements. That is the definition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The definition does not seem unreasonable. If we were looking for an agreed basis on which we might go forward, certainly I think we can proceed from a basis something like that. Maybe the government would want to come back with a further slight modification. We will see what they are proposing. But the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> flat rejection does not give us much prospect of reasonable agreement. We did have a mantra that was obvious and that the minister referred to is in his final remarks just before he flipped out in the last few paragraphs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the minister was talking about consistent themes, he talked about how it was prescriptive. The counterpoint to that was his continued emphasis on the word `flexibility'. Flexibility is, in certain things, such as gymnastics, a very desirable characteristic. But in many aspects of the law, `flexibility' is code for enabling those who are powerful to use their power with less constraint. It is particularly so in the employment relationship. It has been code very often in the debate around the Workplace Relations Act. `Flexibility' is code for taking away the restraints upon the capacity of the more powerful party to the agreement to exercise their power.</PARA>

We have a concern that the government is expressing a profound concern, trying to elevate as a matter of principle the fact that the remuneration outcomes might need to be published. What a shocking suggestion: they might be public. The financial arrangements made for the higher echelons of the Public Service might have to be published. Requirements suggest that about executive agencies. Once again, I thought they had seemed reasonably modest, when we formulated them. The way the minister described them, I thought they must have been changed in the course of the debate. They must have said something other than that which I recalled. The relevant 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12284"> paragraph of the proposed new clause 66 says:</PARA></TALK.START>

I have had quite a large number come through to my office each day. I have constituency operations. At every social function I attend, there are usually a few public servants there. They are not all Labor voters, of course&mdash;I am happy that two&hyphen;thirds of them are, but not all of them are&mdash;but I have not yet had one express that view. I have had quite a few express concerns about the government's bill and most of them say, `Yes, it is improved by the consideration of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts,' and I agree with that. But in all this time I have not yet had one come in and say, `I am deeply,' or even slightly `disappointed by the opposition's approach on this matter.' Everybody who has discussed it with us has said that they think what we are doing is preferable to what you are doing. Some of them would like other changes, but I have not found one who agrees with your view. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate amendments be disagreed to.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Senate also moved three amendments to the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R270">Public Employment (Consequential and Transitional) Amendment Bill 1997</XREF> . These amendments were also unacceptable to the government. Of most concern is the amendment which seeks to retain the complex, outdated and inflexible mobility provisions of the current Public Service Act for those employees who currently have rights under those provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These rights impose heavy management costs in terms of the contingent liabilities represented by return rights for more than 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12285"> 50,000 people. The government was prepared to allow a transitional period under which these employees could return to the APS. What it is not prepared to do is to continue these rights indefinitely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A further amendment extends the period from 12 months to three years during which agencies can amend or revoke the existing service&hyphen;wide determinations which translate across to individual agencies before they lapse. The amendment also prevents agency heads from diminishing or revoking any determination provision unless that provision is incorporated in an award or certified agreement. The government does not accept the amendment because it is of the view that 12 months is an adequate transitional period. Moreover, the amendment would reduce the flexibility of agency heads and prevent them from rationalising existing determinations which will have no relevance to the employees of their agency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Canberra (Mr McMullan) suggests that the government has not been interested in compromise and that public servants will not be concerned over the attitudes of the Labor Party to this bill and the amendments in the Senate. Let me say that the process of consultation which the government has undertaken in the preparation and development of this bill with administrative service officers is absolutely unprecedented in the development of Public Service legislation. There has never been a process of that kind, and certainly none adopted by the Labor Party. This government has undoubtedly consulted more widely with individual public servants in relation to this legislation than the Labor Party has ever done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the government's willingness to compromise, I simply make the point that there were 30 changes to the original draft bill before it was introduced. There were 15 hours of consultations with the trade unions. There were amendments introduced to the bill to meet all 20 recommendations of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. The government also accepted the suggestion of the committee in relation to the Merit Protection Commissioner. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to make the point that it is not the government which is confusing industrial relations reforms and concerns with Public Service reforms. Regrettably, what we see in relation to this bill is the determination of the opposition to attempt to roll back the effects of the Workplace Relations Act, which has already been passed by the parliament and which is currently being applied within the Public Service. The simple fact is that, for ideological reasons and because it is the sectional voice of the trade union movement, the opposition is using this important piece of legislation to conduct a rearguard action against the decision of the parliament to pass the Workplace Relations Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am afraid that it ill becomes the shadow minister, the member for Canberra, to suggest that the government has lost focus in this area. The Labor Party should accept the decision of the parliament; it should recognise that the Public Service is already operating with provisions of the workplace relations legislation and doing so most effectively. I urge the opposition, if there are discussions at a future time about this legislation when it is reintroduced into the parliament, to keep in mind that there are many people in the Public Service who would like it to get off its traditional hobbyhorse, to get the public interest firmly in focus and to support this outstanding piece of legislation.</PARA></SPEECH>

This is the transitional and consequential bill and the arguments with regard to it are essentially those which you have already traversed, and I do not wish to waste anybody's time about that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This debate provides an opportunity to speak on the appropriation bills, an opportunity to take stock of the current economic climate in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12290"> Australia and an opportunity to look at the government's strategies and implementation of policies and the positive impact these strategies and policies have on an electorate such as Bendigo and the nation as a whole.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just want to quote some figures to the House. The Australian economy has grown at an annualised rate of almost six per cent for the September quarter and there is talk of strong expansion for several more quarters. For the month of July, department stores reached their biggest monthly increase in sales on record. For the September quarter, retail sales in this country were at a record for the 15&hyphen;year history of the Australian Bureau of Statistics. We are told that lending for the construction of new homes grew by almost eight per cent in the month of September. Sales of motor vehicles and trucks will reach over $700,000 for the first time ever in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other surveys tell us that business conditions are the best they have been for more than two years. Business investment is forecast to increase by eight per cent this financial year. In the mining sector, capital expenditure has jumped by over 26 per cent. We have already recorded the best inflation performance for 35 years. Average mortgage home repayments are down by almost $70 a month&mdash;around $850 a year. The Telstra float was over 4&half; times oversubscribed. Australia is literally swimming in good statistics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to talk about the impact of that on my own electorate because similar conditions apply there. The population has grown quite strongly. In fact, the population in the city of Greater Bendigo between 1991 and 1996 increased by 3,786 persons, according to ABS figures. That beats the combined increase of 3,473 for Geelong and Ballarat. That is a very favourable increase in the population in Bendigo.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was reflected in an article of 29 October 1997 in the famous <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bendigo Advertiser</EMPHASIS>. The headline reads `Boom time for city'. The article refers to the very large building boom that is currently occurring in Bendigo and which will continue in the future. Some $70 million a year is to be spent on Bendigo over the next three years. According to the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> article, in terms of projected spending for the next 12 months, the big spenders are: Coliban Water, $60 million; Bendigo Mining, $35 million; Bendigo Health Care Group, $32 million; City of Greater Bendigo, $20 million; Bendigo Regional Institute of TAFE, $16 million; Mount Alvernia Hospital, $9 million; Sandhurst Farms, $3 million; and La Trobe University, Bendigo Campus, $2.3 million. From that it is obvious that the economic climate and what both state and federal governments are doing in the Bendigo area are having a significant impact.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Through the Department of Defence, Australian Defence Apparel won a contract for defence service uniforms&mdash;and it is now a private operation and is doing extremely well. The army topographical establishment was granted $1.5 million for new capital facilities. That government money is all going into the electorate of Bendigo. And there is more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is coming in from the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs is very impressive. It is a pity that the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Dr Kemp) has just left the chamber, because he would be very proud to hear about what he has achieved in Bendigo and the substantial amounts of money that have gone into employment, education and training there, including: $318,000 for NEIS training; $555,000 for skillshare; $2.4 million for SES programs; $3.3 million for jobskills; $770,000 for the LEAP scheme&mdash;a program established by the previous government; $79,000 for the CES; $118,000 for Central Victorian Group Training; $2.8 million for schools capital funding; $22.8 million for general recurrent grants for schools; and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12291"> $50,000 for the area consultative committee for administrative costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Department of the Environment has given $450,000, particularly for water projects&mdash;and I mentioned Coliban Water. The Department of Health and Family Services has put in $602,000 for the construction of a hostel and $110,000 for relief housing. The figures are most impressive&mdash;and there is more. Health has given $4.2 million for children's services; $21.5 million for aged care&mdash;and I am pleased to see that there are some members in this House at the moment who will take note of that; $2.4 million for disability programs; and $12.6 million for HACC funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Industrial Relations has given $6,541 for workplace bargaining. Primary Industries and Energy has given $840,000 for the national Landcare program; $150,000 for the farm forestry program; $560,000 for the natural resources management strategy; $92,000 for the rural community access program; and $13,000 for the farms surveys program. Then the schools department has given $892,000 for Big Hill Primary School; $280,000 for Girton Grammar; and $369,000 for Holy Rosary School&mdash;and still it goes on.

Trade export market development grants have totalled $255,000. The black spots program, under Transport and Regional Development, has received $1 million; the Calder Highway, $3 million at the Bulla Diggers Rest area, the Black Forest area $3 million, and, of course, under the roads of national importance program, $80 million has been committed to improvements to the Calder Highway, one of the major contributions to the Calder Highway under the federal&hyphen;state agreement&mdash;a substantial allocation 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of funds. I mentioned the veterans' affairs portfolio: $40,000 at Heathcote, Natte Yallock $2,000 and Mirraburra $2,000.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to concentrate on the additional estimates for the Department of Veterans' Affairs. I note that the department is seeking an increase in appropriated funds of over $300 million, which represents a nearly five per cent increase in the budget estimate for the department. Whilst the portfolio additional estimates detail some 20 pages of extra appropriations, it is notable that an extra $245 million is sought for one single appropriation item, namely, the maintenance of patients in non&hyphen;departmental institutions under the health care and service subprogram. This budget item was allocated some $826 million, so the additional appropriation sought by the minister involves a 30 per cent increase.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would be guilty of a massive understatement if I said that this was only a minor variation. It is amazing to note that the additional estimates statement devotes less than 30 words to explaining this massive additional spending now anticipated. Two less than informative explanations are given. One element of the $245 million increase in the appropriation to maintain veterans in non&hyphen;departmental institutions is that in the portfolio additional estimates statement it is indicated that an extra $189 million is required by DVA because of the transfer from health and community services of the payment of residential care subsidies to entitled veterans. This is a bookkeeping change that is part of the government's regressive changes to residential aged care funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As has become painfully clear over the past few weeks, with the solitary exception of ex&hyphen;prisoners of war, veterans and war widows are as much affected as other senior citizens by the coalition's up&hyphen;front nursing home entry fees, and its new system for nursing homes and hostels. No&hyphen;one would begrudge the fact that ex&hyphen;POWs have their resident contribution paid for them by DVA. This welcome measure was an initiative of the former Labor 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12292"> government that was introduced at the urging of my predecessor, the Hon. Tom Uren, who was himself an ex&hyphen;POW. I note that the department's annual report indicates that 267 ex&hyphen;POWs living in nursing homes are benefiting from this measure. Whilst this is commendable, 267 veterans are a very small minority of our ex&hyphen;service personnel and the war widows. For many weeks, I have been calling on the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) to stand up for the thousands of other veterans and war widows who face the threat of paying up&hyphen;front entry fees and high weekly fees under the coalition's aged care changes. He has constantly failed to do so, and appears content to leave the matter to the Minister for Family Services (Mr Warwick Smith).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, veterans cannot expect any benefit from the extra $189 million which is being appropriated for residential aged care under these bills. According to advice to the Senate additional estimates hearing, this is merely a bookkeeping change. From 1 October, the government has determined that the payment of residential care subsidies for veterans and war widows who have gold or white treatment cards will be the responsibility of the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Previously, most of these subsidies were payable by health and community services. So what we see in these bills is an extra $189 million being charged against the Veterans Affairs' budget. But it is not really extra money, and it goes to the service provider and not to veterans. At the same time, we see a minister who has so far failed to get one extra cent to exempt veterans and war widows from the coalition's changes to nursing homes and hostels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result, veterans and war widows who enter nursing homes now face paying an additional entry charge of up to $4,380. This charge is on top of the standard resident contribution and is to be imposed on veterans with total assets, including the family home, of more than $22,500.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">None of this is about the ageing of the population or about improving the quality of care provided by nursing homes. It is all about the coalition's ideological commitment 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to user pays and a reduced role for government as an incentive for self&hyphen;provision, as exemplified by the claim by its National Commission of Audit that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a high proportion of our retired population are in a position to meet at least a significant share of the costs of their own health and care needs. The Commission is not questioning the policy objective of providing nursing home assistance to those in need but is questioning whether the preservation of clients' wealth, at the expense of the rest of the community, should be part of that policy objective. More importantly, a large share of those currently working have the potential to prepare for their future health and care needs but face a substantial disincentive through current government funding arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There we have the genesis, the ideological bent and the driving force behind these measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would seek clarification from the minister as to what measures he will implement to spell out to the ex&hyphen;service community the details of the aged care changes that so severely impact on them. In the September issue of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Vetaffairs</EMPHASIS> there were a full two pages of government propaganda with ludicrous, almost laughable, headings, such as `Bonds to lift accommodation standards in nursing homes' and a further article `Looking after the veteran community'. This was all before the Prime Minister's famous `I was wrong' backdown. It was notable that the October&hyphen;November issue of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Vetaffairs</EMPHASIS> wisely chose to ignore the aged care changes completely, presumably because no&hyphen;one could tell them what the government's policy actually was.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now we see the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) has written to the Prime Minister saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will be vital to avoid reigniting the issue in the media. Accordingly, I propose not to make a formal Ministerial Statement to the House nor any other highly visible public announcement in relation to the technical details of the policy . . . Instead I propose to have the Department of Health and Family Services issue fact sheets and information products clarifying issues as necessary . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is an appallingly cynical approach to the community's right to know the details of a major government program; one that has generated considerable controversy and uncertainty in the community.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12293">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other aspect of these budget changes comes under the title of `Cost of veterans' usage of non&hyphen;departmental hospitals'. This is now expected to be more than $56.2 million higher than the budget estimate. Through questioning by Labor senators at the additional estimates hearing on 13 November, the government revealed that an extra $9.5 million was due to the sale of Lady Davidson Hospital and $5.7 million was due to greater than expected usage of public hospitals. By implication, this means that $41 million was due to increased usage of private hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Previously, Lady Davidson Hospital was funded under a number of separate appropriate items. Variations in these items have to be reported as part of the additional estimates process, thus providing the parliament&mdash;that is, the people of Australia&mdash;with at least some hazy insight into the financial transactions. Until recently, the only information on the public record about this sale was the minister's release of 26 June announcing that the hospital had been sold to Australian Hospital Care with effect from 1 October, and indicating that there would be a Mirvac housing project and a RAAF Association aged care facility developed on vacant parts of the site. No financial information was provided, and my office was then informed that the details of the service contract between the department and the new owners was commercially confidential information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Subsequently, we learnt in the department's annual report that the government received $16.5 million for the sale of the hospital and that a parcel of land worth a further $5.8 million had been transferred to Australian Estate Management. What is more interesting are the further revelations in the additional estimates statement. As Lady Davidson ceased to be a federally managed facility on 1 October, some $4.2 million that was previously allocated is now no longer required. This is to be offset against the additional amount of $9.5 million that I have already referred to which is to enable the department, under a separate appropriation item, to contract for Australian Hospital Care to provide care for veterans for the remainder of the financial year. The fact that there is a $5.3 million 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> variation between the two figures raises some interesting issues. One possible explanation is that the government has contracted out the running of the hospital to the private sector to increase the cost to the taxpayer compared with what applied when it was run directly by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would not be surprised if this was the correct interpretation. But the government hides behind the confidentiality of commercial transactions to prevent the parliament&mdash;that is, the people&mdash;ascertaining the truth. A further possible explanation is that the sale took effect from a different date than was anticipated when the budget was finalised. This could well be part of the story, but I do not see how an adjustment to the date could itself produce such a substantial variation in the outlays involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 16 October, the department is probably the largest purchaser of private hospital services in Australia and, seemingly, the minister supports a mindless increased reliance on private hospitals. Thus I am becoming increasingly concerned that we are being asked to appropriate ever increasing amounts of taxpayer funds to private hospital operators without being fully provided with the necessary information. I stress that in raising this issue I am not pursuing an agenda against the new owners and operators of Lady Davidson Hospital. They operate 17 other hospitals in Australia and I am sure they are dedicated to providing a high&hyphen;class service to veterans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to highlight the minister's complete and utter silence on the future of Victoria's specialist repatriation hospital, which is now part of the Austin and Repatriation Medical Centre, A&amp;RMC. This hospital has clearly suffered under the destructive policies of the Kennett government. Members do not need to take my word for this. They only have to read the annual report of the minister's own National Treatment Monitoring Committee. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although hospital data presented by the Department during the year indicated good usage of the facilities on both campuses, a continuing drift of patients away from A&amp;RMC was evident . . . Members raised a number of concerns during the year about the A&amp;RMC, relating mainly to access to the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12294"> Heidelberg campus and long waits during emergency after&hyphen;hours admissions.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The accompanying report of the Victorian Treatment Monitoring Committee contained more specific details. It revealed that the number of veteran separations from the hospital had fallen to around 9,000, which is 45 per cent less than the number that occurred when the Commonwealth last ran the hospital. I would suggest that a 45 per cent fall in veteran usage of the hospital is more than the drift referred to in the annual report. A full scale evacuation would seem a more appropriate description.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part of the fall could be explained by veterans choosing to access hospitals closer to their home. However, I find it hard to believe that this is the only factor involved and very much doubt that any other repatriation hospital has seen such a fall in veteran usage. In reality, veterans are voting with their feet against the Kennett government's management of the hospital.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald&hyphen;Sun</EMPHASIS> of 6 June staff claimed the hospital's operating theatre walls were now washed only once a month&mdash;previously this was a task undertaken daily before Kennett's cuts&mdash;and that services and staff conditions were at risk because of the coalition's contracting&hyphen;out agenda. In this context there has been total inaction and total silence from the minister, as has been detailed earlier, in regard to aged care and nursing care in this country.</PARA></SPEECH>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government. This government does not want to dwell on that but, rather, accept that, having been elected, we take up the challenge to fix those problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of funding proposals have gone into my electorate. The other night I mentioned some $52 million which has gone into Ballarat itself. Indeed, that was only a part of it. Tonight I would like to talk about those other parts of my electorate that I so proudly represent: the region surrounding Stawell, Avoca and Ballan; the new parts of my electorate, Daylesford, Creswick and Clunes and the regions surrounding those areas; and the area in the Golden Plains shire around Haddon and Smythesdale. These are terrific areas, and I am very proud to represent them. There are numerous smaller towns and some fantastic farming families in between those major centres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To give the House a small indication of some of the funding that has gone into my electorate, the Hepburn Shire Council&mdash;that is Daylesford, Clunes and Creswick&mdash;received $593,000 last year for HACC services for the community visitor scheme, which is a terrific program; emergency relief funding for the Wimmera Community Care Centre in Stawell, which was desperately needed; the Golden Region Development Organisation&mdash;or the Golden RDO&mdash;a farm forestry program, some half a million dollars; the Shire of Pyrenees, emergency relief funding; and financial assistance grants for the Northern Grampians Shire, Golden Plains Shire, Hepburn Shire, Moorabool Shire and Pyrenees Shire, which takes in the areas of Avoca and district, the Moorabool Shire, Ballan and district.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Lexton Landcare Group, the Project Platypus Committee, the Elmhurst Landcare Group, the Walwa&hyphen;Lubeck Landcare Group, the Navarre and District Landcare Group, the Northern Grampians Landcare Group, the Amphitheatre Landcare Group and the Ullina Landcare Group are just some of the marvellous organisations in my electorate that are doing so much for the environment. We have also given money to the Avoca and District Bush Nursing Hospital, which has a terrific group of people providing a marvellous service; emergency relief funding for the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12295"> Shire of Pyrenees, as I mentioned earlier; emergency funding for the Western Highlands Health Service; and the Northern Grampian Shire Council&mdash;40 extra long day care places for Wimmera Community Care in Stawall. Money for schools&mdash;for looking after our children in regional and rural areas&mdash;is money very well spent. The Daylesford Primary School, the Avoca Primary School, the Myrniong and Natte Yallock Primary School are just a few.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today I proudly announce half a million dollars to the University of Ballarat for incubator funding, which is a three&hyphen;year program. Jobs in information technology and general manufacturing are good for Ballarat, good for job opportunities, good for those who want to start up a small business and good for the people they will eventually employ.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my speech the other night I started to quote the Hon. Bill Hayden in relation to a letter he wrote in his position as the chief negotiator with the Right to Negotiate Team in respect of the Century Zinc mineral project. I will table the letter in due course, but I want to go through some of the quotes here. I will quote parts of the letter, not because I want to selectively quote it but because it is a very long letter which I note was sent to the state opposition leader Mr Beattie; the Prime Minister, Mr Howard; the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Tim Fischer; the federal opposition leader, Mr Beazley; and the Democrats leader, Senator Cheryl Kernot before she jumped. Mr Hayden obviously believed it was important enough to write to all those people. The letter states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What became abundantly clear to me quite early is how complex, even confusing, the drafting of the relevant legislation is&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is the Native Title Act, I hasten to add, not the legislation that has just been rejected by the Senate&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the opportunities the legislation offers for outside manipulation of processes and for the adoption of measures which come perilously close at times to being extortion; the absence of any definition of who can be a claimant and the seemingly unlimited opportunities for people to register as such; the unrepresentativeness of some who register as claimants; the confusion and tensions which can 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> become rampant as long standing factional and family disputes within a tribal group manifest themselves at the expense of the issue to be settled; the jealousy and mistrust which can arise between different tribal bodies and which can impair negotiating processes. And this is by no means an exhaustive list of the problems which stud the present NTA.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Incidentally, it is as clear as a pike staff that the Keating Labor Government (and Parliament more generally) believed that it had enacted legislation with the Native Title Act which established,<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> inter alia</EMPHASIS> , that the issue of a pastoral lease extinguished any native title which might otherwise have existed. The Chief Justice of the High Court and two of his colleagues ruled in that way recently, and with a common, and I might add a good common sense judgment. A majority determination of only one (ie. four justices) ruled otherwise, for a variety of expressed reasons as between the different justices and in this prolix and unreassuring manner law was made and imposed on the community at clear odds with the quite apparent intent of the representative and accountable legislature. This surprising majority judgment will make an already difficult process for determining issues related to claims for native title even more complex, (much, much more so as things stand right now), extremely time consuming and add further to the costs of what is already a very expensive procedure.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I sincerely hope that the Howard Government is able to remedy these grave defects. But allowing for the nature of the Senate at times this will probably be a very difficult task.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Prophetic words, indeed. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The tragedy of failure to rectify these shortcomings will cause major national economic detriment. I doubt that many Australians realise that Australia's comparative advantages as a venue for large scale investment in mineral development projects is apparently facing stiffer competitions around the globe.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Further on it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I expect that I should propose some positive alternatives after expressing these criticisms of aspects of the present processes. First, the right to be a claimant should be clearly defined and limited by statute to some person or persons or a body who or which is genuinely representative.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Resolution of the issue of Native Title, now that the High Court has made it a permanent part of the national social&hyphen;political&hyphen;economic landscape, is beyond me, in spite of the simplistic nostrums 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12296"> some have recommended. First, we do not have a clear, precise meaning to this concept, one which can be applied generally and practically. The recent High Court judgments make that clear. Every case has to be considered separately and from a fresh start. This overall process, in contested cases, will be extraordinarily complex and time consuming and could go on exhaustively and without conclusion through the lifetime of a generation of Australians. If that sounds like hyperbole look at the record of the National Native Title Tribunal. In spite of being staffed by diligent, able and committed people not one contested native title claim has been resolved by that body after four years of operation. It is, furthermore, confronted with a huge backlog of claims, many yet to be properly addressed and in all, representing, I suspect, an almost impossible task in any practical sense. And it is, because of the requirements imposed on it and the procedures which, accordingly, have to be adopted, a costly organisation to maintain. Imagine the resources which it will require for this expanded function arising from the recent Wik decision! Consider then the likely delays in adjudicating claims!</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What fascinates me is that most ordinary members of the public, from my experience with them, mistakenly presume that native title is the equivalent of the right of Aboriginal entry onto leased land for traditional ceremonial and hunting purposes. It is, of course, much more than that. The best way I can describe the concept, as a simplistic and easy working guideline, is that Native Title is somewhat akin to freehold land ownership in circumstances where, for instance, the valid conditions of a pastoral lease have not extinguished that right. Costly and lengthy legal disputes will occur, of course, over whether any degree of extinguishment has taken place or not. And what a congested legal process will build up.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is a long letter. Bill Hayden has the respect of many Australians right across a broad political spectrum. Quite frankly, for Bill Hayden, who has been involved, to express these concerns is a very clear indication that this government's decision to put up a 10&hyphen;point plan has been vindicated. It is an utter tragedy for this country that the Senate did what it did today.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this debate on the appropriation bills, I wish to make some comments on the transport appropriations, and in particular appropriations that have not been adequately explained by this government. In fact, on several occasions, we have had a refusal to explain. I refer to consultancies regarding the water 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> front which have been awarded to a variety of people who have very good qualifications with respect to their Liberal credentials&mdash;including working in the Liberal Party secretariat and working for former Liberal ministers, former Liberal premiers and the like&mdash;but who have very little in the way of expertise on waterfront reform.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note that the minister representing the then minister for transport in the Senate, Senator Alston&mdash;when refusing to table the report from one of these consultants, ACIL Economics, which is headed by David Trebeck, formerly of the National Farmers Federation and former Liberal Party operative&mdash;indicated the reason for refusing to table this report was that individuals may be under threat of physical violence if the report was tabled. He did not actually indicate which individuals would be so under threat, nor did he indicate who would potentially be threatening them. In recent days, we have become aware of some other issues associated with prospective violence in waterfront matters&mdash;not necessarily of the sort that Senator Alston had in mind but, nonetheless, equally or even more serious.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We now perhaps know what he was referring to in this issue. We have evidence that there is a group of industrial mercenaries being created to work on the Australian waterfront, headed by Mr Michael Wells and Mr Peter Kilfoyle, with expertise in areas such as: crowd control; electronic surveillance; training in small arms; close quarters personal control, including unarmed combat techniques, restraint holds and blocks, use of a baton, attack blocks and holds, use of handcuffs and various methods of searching offenders. It has been drawn to my attention this evening that, on 24 September 1987 at the Magistrates Court in Goulburn, Peter Kilfoyle was convicted of possession of a sawn&hyphen;off shotgun and for failing to stop after an accident.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have also been advised that in September 1994, Peter Kilfoyle worked for a very brief period as a bodyguard for Victorian Premier, Jeff Kennett, while he was in Ballarat. I do not contest Mr Kilfoyle's right to work and apply the skills that he clearly has in certain 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12297"> circumstances. Clearly, there is a need for these sorts of skills in some situations in our community. That cannot be contested.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what I do criticise is a situation where this government is endorsing, approving and supporting the deployment of ex&hyphen;military&mdash;and until now current military&mdash;people on the waterfront, organised by people such as Mr Kilfoyle and others of this background. It is extraordinary that the government has refused to answer so many questions. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has refused to answer on two occasions whether there is any government money involved in this exercise. The Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) has refused to answer, both in this chamber and outside to the media, whether his staff had any prior knowledge of this exercise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a situation where probably the most serious industrial relations drama in this country's history is about to unfold over the next few months. The government is pretending that it knows nothing and pretending that it has had no involvement; yet, day by day, the indications of its complicity are mounting. It is an absolute disgrace that the Howard government is supporting a covert operation to put troops on the Australian waterfront organised by people of this background.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have indicated, Mr Wells and Mr Kilfoyle are entitled to work in various forms of activities, various occupations, making use of the skills and expertise that they have. But their skills and expertise are entirely inappropriate for industrial relations&mdash;be it on the waterfront or anywhere else&mdash;they are entirely inappropriate for the sort of activity that they are now engaged in, and with the overt support of the government. The government is claiming that it is not involved in organising this exercise, yet the indications are mounting that it very clearly is. The Prime Minister is refusing to answer questions that indicate whether or not that involvement is there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, even if we can believe that there is no involvement, even if we can believe Peter Reith when he says that he had no previous knowledge and that it does not matter if his staff did or not, this government 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is approving of this exercise. The Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan) stood up yesterday and said, `Great stuff. Fantastic. If it is going to improve competition on the waterfront, I am all for it.' Those are his very words. The government, the Prime Minister and the various ministers involved have all indicated that they approve of this process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a total disgrace that the federal government can approve of what is now unfolding, where you have got troops&mdash;former military and current military people&mdash;being organised in a covert operation; so covert that it involves them being locked up for three weeks in a hangar somewhere in New South Wales when they get back in order to train additional people. They are not even going to be let out in case they might frighten the locals. It is a covert operation with the involvement of a foreign government in order to use their port facilities for training purposes and in order to displace existing Australian workers who are complying with the law, who are not breaking any law or any industrial regulations, who are complying with their industrial agreements, putting them out of work and putting troops onto the waterfront.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a legitimate debate in this country about waterfront reform. The government has one view; the opposition has a different view. That is a legitimate debate. But, regardless of what position you take in that debate, regardless of your view as to whether the government's perspective on how good or bad the waterfront is is correct or our perspective is correct or what the appropriate approach is, this is not the answer. This is a disaster for this country. This government will live to regret its involvement in and its endorsement of this outrageous activity.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;The parliament has been debating the additional estimates in the appropriation bills and, as is the normal practice on occasions such as this, reflecting on a very wide range of topics, some about the general state of the economy and the prospects for the future, some about the administration of the range of government programs and, in some instances, the specific appropriations the government 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12298"> proposes to make for various portfolio departments. I note that on some occasions the members opposite have gone nowhere near that and have sought to use the occasion for more wide&hyphen;ranging comments on a number of topics which do not seem to be relevant to the bill before the House. But, be that as it may, that has typified that type of debate on occasions such as this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In essence, it has been an opportunity for members to put forward their views on the state of the economy and its management by the government, and they have done so. I thank the members for the manner in which they have contributed to the debate. I do not accept the criticism levelled at the government by the members opposite. The government's management of the economy continues to receive the resounding endorsement of the Australian electorate, from economic commentators and the whole of the business sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">First and foremost, in a fair and equitable manner, the consolidated measures of the government have turned around the $10.3 billion deficit left to the government by Labor into a sizeable headline surplus this financial year with an underlying surplus forecast for the 1998&hyphen;99 year. This year, for the first time in almost a decade, the Commonwealth has no net borrowing requirement. Indeed, it is estimated that the Commonwealth will repay over $5 billion of government debt, freeing future generations of Australians from the debt and associated debt servicing costs that were threatening to drown them. It is estimated that by 2000&hyphen;01 this government will have halved the Commonwealth's net debt to GDP ratio, ensuring Australians can face the new millennium in the knowledge that Australia's future has been secured.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All Australians have benefited from the substantial and sustained reduction in interest rates of some 2&half; percentage points. These reductions are a positive mark of confidence from the financial markets on the success of this government in addressing the black hole and the structural problems left to us by the Labor Party. The recent release of the September quarterly national accounts provides a positive report card for the government's 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> endeavours to get the budget back on a even keel: GDP grew by 1.5 percentage points in seasonally adjusted terms in the September quarter and by some 3.6 percentage points in the year to September.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Encouragingly, private consumption growth in the September quarter was very strong and there has been solid growth in business investment and new assets in both of the last two quarters, though this growth has been masked to some extent by the impact of the large public sector asset sales. After making adjustments for a number of one&hyphen;off transactions in both the June and September quarters, the national accounts data is consistent with the economy growing at around four per cent per annum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The September quarter national accounts describe the strength of the domestic economy and imply that growth may remain solid despite the instability in Australian financial markets. As the Treasurer (Mr Costello) has said on a number of occasions, Australia now has high growth and low inflation. They are very good signs for the future, and they are very good signs for an increase in employment in the course of the next year. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that if the Leader of the House is suggesting that this is an approximation then the opposition is not unhappy about that, but we think that the opposition should at least have about an hour to discuss whatever comes back to us from the Senate, because there are a number of people on this side who wish to speak. Indeed, the government has said that they wish to accommodate the views of all sorts of members, including our dear friends from the Independents, and we would like to think that they should have something to say on this as well. Around an hour is what we think should be done. The Minister for Finance and Administration (Mr Fahey) has suggested there should be a little bit longer, and I think the Minister for Finance and Administration is a very decent fellow because he understood, out of the New South Wales parliament, that you have to be reasonable about these things.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we want to cooperate with the government. We would like to see us get out of here around 11 o'clock tomorrow.

We think that should take about an hour. The government, I think, suggests there will be a division and we would all be happy with that, but the government should understand that, if it wants to suggest that we will do this in a shorter period of time, that is a bit unfair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I really think, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, that your constituents and the people of Australia would want us to consider these amendments properly. If the Leader of the House thinks that many amendments from the Senate that are not known to this House should be dealt with in five minutes, or 15 minutes or 50 minutes, then the people of Australia will think that something better should be done by us. I would say to the government, on behalf of the opposition, that around an hour is an honest thing for us all to do so that all points of view can be canvassed. This is a bill that the government says they are going to go to an election on. They 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12300"> may not say that tomorrow, but they will say that and they have said that, and if this is so important that we should go to an election on it, then it deserves some consideration by this House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said to the Leader of the House earlier tonight that part of my job as Deputy Manager of Opposition Business is to be a nasty piece of work, but I am also aware of the view that I had when I sat in your chair, Mr Deputy Speaker, and in the Speaker's chair, that the House of Representatives matters. And it does matter&mdash;it matters a lot. If this House matters for anything, if we are going to have an election about this piece of legislation, then this House should discuss it. We should not discuss it for five minutes or 10 minutes or for 50 minutes; we should discuss it for at least a respectable amount of time and we should hear from a respectable number of people on this side.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Leader of the House has other pressures upon him. He has got all these terrible government members who do not care about this legislation and want to go home.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. My point of order is that it is a discretion open to you to withdraw the indulgence. I thought we had an agreement about the handling of matters for tomorrow. We obviously do not have an agreement, and we therefore need to discuss the matter further. I was only advising members of the House of what I understood to be the agreement because I thought people would like to know before they leave tonight. Given that the Chief Opposition Whip does not believe that to be the case, then my seeking indulgence was obviously premature. I suggest that rather than having a debate, let us discuss it later.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I will always bow to your generosity. I would love to bow to the generosity of my dear friend the Leader of the House, and we will both sue each other for those words. If we are talking about an approximation, we are understanding about that. But we would just say to the Leader of the House that flexibility tomorrow will be very useful for everybody. A decent canvassing of the views about this piece of legislation tomorrow is important not just for this House but for the Australian people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But if this House only wants to talk about this piece of legislation for a little while after the Senate has talked about it for a long while, I would suggest to the government that they are abrogating to the other place, where the real rights about where the government of this country is made. Tomorrow we hope that we will have an hour, just an hour.</PARA></SPEECH>
