<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The purpose of this bill is to give effect to the transfer of responsibility for the University of Canberra from the Commonwealth to the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) and to amend the Maritime College Act 1978.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The transfer of the University of Canberra from Commonwealth to ACT jurisdiction was first proposed by the University of Canberra. The university considers that its future is bound up with the growth and development of the ACT, since the university is a key provider of professional education and advice in education and research. The transfer will bring the university closer to ACT activities such as infrastructure and land development, health education and the ACT school system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth and the ACT governments agree that there will be considerable benefits to the university and the Canberra community in the university being more closely identified with the city. The university's comprehensive undergraduate teaching programs and expanding presence in graduate education, research and international education services are of great importance to the continued economic and cultural life of the city. There are strong mutual benefits to be obtained from facilitating collaboration between the university and territory government agencies, businesses and community organisations. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In order to facilitate the transfer, this bill:</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">&hyphen;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> amends the University of Canberra Act 1989 (the act) where appropriate and necessary prior to the conversion so that the act will reflect the change of jurisdiction;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">&hyphen;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> amends the Australian Capital Territory (Self&hyphen;Government) Act 1988 to make the act an ACT enactment;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">&hyphen;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> provides consequential amendments to the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973; and</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">&hyphen;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> provides certain transitional arrangements in relation to preservation of the rights and accrued entitlements of University officers and staff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth government is transferring the act with its existing framework intact. Any changes to it are appropriately made by the ACT Legislative Assembly after the transfer is made. However, any employee rights of coverage under Commonwealth occupational health and safety, industrial or administrative law for incidents occurring prior to the transfer day will continue. Coverage for incidents occurring after the transfer day will be determined according to the law of the territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill also amends the Maritime College Act 1978 to provide the council of the Australian Maritime College with the power to make statutes for or in relation to the regulation or control of traffic or parking. Currently, parking spaces at the Australian Maritime College are being used by others to the detriment of the college staff and students. The act is amended to allow the college to enforce car parking regulations. I commend the bill to the House and I present a signed copy of the explanatory memorandum to the bill.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, I present the following report&mdash; 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2546"> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report 351&mdash;Advisory report on the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill 1996</EMPHASIS> .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ordered that the report be printed.</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZT4">Mr SOMLYAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The Charter of Budget Honesty Bill had its genesis in a recommendation from a previous report of the Joint Public Accounts Committee in the previous parliament. That report was tabled in November 1995. I believe that the government had adequate opportunity, if it wanted to, to adopt the recommendations of that report. It did not so do. It was left to this government upon election to adopt the principle of the charter of budget honesty. In adopting that principle, it then embodied the principle in the legislation of this bill. In the budget speech on 20 August 1996, the Treasurer said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before its election defeat on 2 March, the previous Government maintained that the budget would now be in underlying balance. The truth was nearly $10 billion to the contrary.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The reason why this charter of budget honesty is being introduced and given effect is so that no other government will ever be placed in that position again. As I said in my speech on this bill in this House, I did not believe that this bill ought to be referred to the JCPA; but the Senate in its wisdom so did and we reported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As honourable members are aware, the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill was referred to the JCPA on 3 March for tabling today. As a consequence of this tight deadline, the committee held only one public hearing, taking evidence from the stakeholders in the public sector and from peak representative groups in the private sector. Those groups which were unable to attend managed to make submissions within our tight timetable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee supports the framework in the bill as it implements mechanisms for improving the accountability and transparency of government fiscal policy objectives, strategies and outcomes. The JCPA believes that the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill is another element in the improvement of the overall fiscal accountability framework. Transparency is the essence of such a framework, and this bill legislates for the provision of regular 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> published reports so that the public may be better informed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Speaker, it should be noted that there is no opposition to this bill as such in the House. The opposition has been supportive of the need for such a charter as was indicated during the second reading debate in this House. Although for 13 years they did not adopt one, they support the adoption by this government. It is very simple to support these measures in opposition, but it is another thing to have the intestinal fortitude to introduce them and to give them effect when in government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During its review of the bill, the committee encountered widespread general support and very little criticism. However, there are several important aspects which I wish to draw to the parliament's attention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Schedule 1, clauses 12(3), 16(3), 19(2) and 24(3): while the committee applauds the requirement for fiscal reports to be prepared in accordance with recognised external reporting standards, the committee believes firmly that the reasons for any deviations from those standards should be fully explained in the reports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Schedule 1, clauses 12(4), 16(5) and 24(5): although the committee recognises the need to suppress information of a confidential commercial or national security nature, it believes that a statement providing a general description of the information being suppressed and its aggregate amount should be included in the reports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Schedule 1, clauses 13, 17, 28 and 32: the committee is pleased that the fiscal reports being legislated by this bill provide an approximation of whole&hyphen;of&hyphen;government reporting. However, the above named clauses enable Commonwealth agencies to withhold information. Where this occurs, then a statement showing the effect of this omission and its aggregate amount should be included in the reports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Schedule 1, clause 22: the committee notes that a pre&hyphen;election economic and fiscal outlook report is to be released within 10 days of the issue of the writ for a general election. Given that a writ can be delayed up to 10 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2547"> days after the dissolution of parliament, the committee believes that it would be more sensible to have the pre&hyphen;election reports released within 10 days of the dissolution of parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My final point, Mr Speaker, is to seek the agreement of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) to include a review component in the schedule of the bill so that the full reporting process can be assessed after the next election. I am confident that our report reflects the concerns of the parliament. The JCPA looks forward to receiving the government's response to report 351.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I am glad to be here today as Deputy Chair of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts for the presentation of report 351, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">An Advisory Report on the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill 1996</EMPHASIS> . I concur with most of what the chair of the committee, the honourable member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay), has said with regard to this legislation and this report. It certainly has the support of the opposition. I might say that in some of the discussions we had at the committee there was not always that high level of agreement. However, I think the report we have come down with is quite a modest but important contribution to the consideration of the bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of issues around this legislation which were mentioned by the chair, and some others that were not, need to be looked at with respect to its operation. I will briefly mention some of those in the short time that I have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly it is true that the comments regarding the bill that came before the committee either from witnesses or, in some respects, in submissions were generally positive. I think generally there was strong support out there. However, there is certainly a question as to just how this bill will actually work, and certainly some concerns were expressed at the hearings regarding the detail of that in practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The consultation process around this particular piece of legislation and the consideration of it by the committee was quite short. In the circumstances we only had submissions open for, I think, a matter of days because of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the very tight time line placed on the committee by the motion through the Senate. As I understand the position of the government, they need this legislation through during this session. I think that has limited the capacity of many individuals and groups to go through the detail of how the operation of the bill will occur and what the circumstances will be of the actual utilisation of this legislation in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that, certainly there is an expectation publicly that this legislation is not only a good thing but that it will lead to a material change. I am not so sure about the material change aspect. As the chair mentioned, this is a bill more suited for opposition than for government, but certainly in my position I hope for significant change. But I remain to be convinced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of issues were raised regarding this bill, and a number of them were covered by the chair of the committee, but I would like to pick up on a couple of comments. This legislation is largely a codification of existing practice. There are some improvements, and I commend those improvements, but it is largely a codification of existing practice. I think the circumstances were summed up best, from my point of view, by Professor Marc Robinson who made a submission to the inquiry. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No legislation can compel fiscal responsibility . . . The most positive view of the Bill is that it is merely the latest in a long series of incremental improvements in fiscal reporting requirements.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What it does is largely build on what the previous government had done over some 13 years. It makes some improvements but, with respect to some of those improvements such as intergenerational reporting and the pre&hyphen;election statements, we will have to see how they work in operation versus the question of what the expectations are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another issue which came up during the inquiry is the question of forecasts made by Treasury particularly but also in general terms regarding the private sector. The thing about the forecasting of economic indicators and projections is that it is crucial in terms of the political debate, not only in terms of budgetary implications with respect to actual judg 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2548"> ments being made and produced by government and by departments as being where we are really going on a financial basis, but also in terms of the expectations of what will occur in the future. A comment was made by the Secretary of Treasury on this issue, which I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is in the nature of forecasts that they will always be wrong and we have to do our best to minimise those errors.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Obviously that statement is self-evident, but I do not think it is a statement which is really understood in the broader situation of the media and the public. Quite often, things do go off the rails but it is not on the basis of some form of chicanery, as is suggested on occasions by some. It is more in terms of the fact that the detail that is there is not sufficient and the circumstances change.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have just had a recent black hole from the current Treasurer (Mr Costello)&mdash;which maybe gives an example of that, I do not know.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another issue I would raise briefly is the question of the signing off by the secretaries to the Treasury or Finance with respect to economic and fiscal reports produced by the government. The proposal under this bill is for that to be done with the pre&hyphen;election report. That is fine, but members of the opposition raised the issue&mdash;and I believe it to be true&mdash;that other reports such as the budget ought to be done in the same way. It ought to be done on a regular basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this bill is about honesty, then let us have that honesty out in the open. Let it not only be honest but be seen to be honest by having reports like that signed off. I will leave my comments there. I commend the report to the House and I wish the bill a speedy passage in the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I will be very brief. The first point I want to get on the record is that I do not believe it was necessary for the Senate to refer the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill back to the JCPA, and certainly we were given limited time to have a look at some of the elements of it. So on that basis and on behalf of all 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> members of the committee and the chair, I would like to thank the witnesses who appeared at short notice on the one day of public hearings we held. I suppose to a certain extent that was constructive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I commented yesterday when tabling the report on the Auditor-General's reports, the Department of Finance people reiterated that the process of introducing accrual accounting is very slow. This is not going to speed it up, but it is one area that is going to be very necessary in this process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The one comment the committee has made in this extra review of the bill is that we believe a review component should be included in the bill so the full reporting process can be assessed after the next election to see whether the highlighted benefits that the bill will provide will actually accrue to the public. We believe they will.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the bill is an important step forward for the public management of Australia by government and as far as the transparency and accountability of the operations of government are concerned, particularly with the pre-election reports. It means the people of Australia will be able to understand clearly and know the economic situation of the country prior to elections. I commend the bill to the House and, along with the member for Bruce (Mr Griffin), trust it has a speedy passage through the Senate from here.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB2></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There has been an agreement to bring the AIDC Sale Bill on at this time because we in the opposition have been pushing for a provision to be made to allow for grievances and 90-second statements today. There was a reluctance on the part of the government to embrace that and I know it is not listed on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>  today, but the understanding is that, between now and 2 o'clock, we will be aiming to complete the AIDC Sale Bill and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2549"> allow 90 or so minutes for grievances and 90-second statements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mention that not only to reflect the agreement and our intent but to indicate that at some stage the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) or a representative may need to move a motion to enable us to get into grievances and 90-second statements. We on this side respect the importance of those debates for backbenchers, and they should not be crowded out by government business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But turning to this bill. The bill was introduced into the parliament on 27 February. It makes legislative amendments to enable the sale of the Australian Industry Development Corporation&mdash;the AIDC as it is known. It was established in 1970 as an investment bank to finance Australian industry. Its role when established was essentially to fill a gap that was not then adequately covered by the banking sector and other financial lenders. It essentially was established to cover cases where the development would not otherwise take place or would have only been possible in circumstances, unless local finance was available, that involved ownership and control going to foreign investors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the years the AIDC has pioneered infrastructure financing, and it has a unique capability of turning public policy into reality through reacting as a policy lever for national development. It developed widely recognised project, resource and infrastructure financing expertise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the many significant examples and developments which occurred with AIDC financing include the Woodside North West Shelf gas project, which involved $US1.6 billion of financing, and the Argyle Diamond project, where the AIDC was the only Australian financier. There would have been no Australian equity in it but for the AIDC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also mention the Eraring Power Station project, which was financed through AIDC, and the nucleus telectronics pacemaker, which AIDC underwrote the initial financing of. In addition to all of those very worthwhile and significant infrastructure investments, the AIDC has contributed some $130 million in dividend payments to the Commonwealth since 1983.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The AIDC did undergo some substantial losses several years ago. As a consequence, it restructured its operations and it has subsequently recovered well, with annual after tax earnings forecast to be around $60 million this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We recognise it was the coalition election policy to privatise the AIDC. They confirmed this in last year's budget. It is against that background that, overall, Labor will not be opposing the bill. However, we do have some concerns about the legislation and the way the sale is to be conducted. Many of these concerns are reflected in our second reading amendment as well as the amendment we will move in the detail of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Overall, the AIDC has performed well. It did make a loss in 1991, but most banks reported major losses in that period. But it did not, through its difficult period, need to draw on the government guarantee. The loss occurred largely because in the mid&hyphen; to late&hyphen;1980s the AIDC had moved away from its core business of infrastructure and resources. We, as a Labor Party, believe there is still a need for activity in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It moved away from those core businesses&mdash;infrastructure and resources&mdash;towards a far greater emphasis on fee based merchant banking and business. Following its restructure, it did make pre&hyphen;tax profits of $175 million over the last four years. As I have already indicated, it expects to make a pre-tax profit of some $60 million this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The AIDC currently employs some 200 people. The Labor Party does not want to see overly generous golden handshakes&mdash;or, in the case of some, golden handcuffs&mdash;going to AIDC senior management. But, apart from that group, we are concerned that the ordinary workers in the organisation are not disadvantaged by the sale. I note that concerns were expressed about this during the Senate committee hearings earlier this week. Labor is pleased that assurances have now been given that the existing terms and conditions of employment for these workers will be maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The AIDC is one of two Australian controlled and independent investment houses. There is a real chance that, through this sale, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2550"> it could be purchased by overseas interests, particularly as there are no special provisions in the bill to deal with foreign ownership. Labor notes the assurances of the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp) in the Senate earlier this week that, if the buyer is overseas owned, AIDC's 48&half; per cent holding in the Australian Submarine Corporation could be excluded from the sale. We welcome that assurance but believe we need to legislate to ensure that assurance. That is the purpose of the amendment that we will be moving when we consider the detail of this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will be essentially moving at that stage that the Australian Submarine Corporation component be removed from AIDC Ltd and located within the corporation which is to stay in place under this legislative arrangement to manage the borrowings and loan portfolio and to manage such national interest assets as the Commonwealth's Australian Submarine Corporation shareholding. Essentially, the AIDC will remain in existence. It needs to manage certain activities. We are saying that this is where the Australian Submarine Corporation shareholding should be parked to ensure the guarantee, the assurance, that was given by Senator Kemp in another place. It will also ensure that the ASC does not become foreign controlled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">AIDC has also been a significant investor in Australian infrastructure development. I mentioned some very significant examples a little earlier. Approximately half of its activity in the infrastructure development field has been in regional Australia. The sale of AIDC, without a genuine effort to replace it, will be seen as part of the government's continued assault on regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many reasons why regional Australia feels, rightly, that they have been betrayed by this government. The first act of the Howard government in relation to regional development was to cut $150 million in regional infrastructure projects, despite the fact that they promised during the election campaign that they would not do it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the announcement was made by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp)&mdash;he still calls himself the regional development minister but, as his first 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> act, abolished his own department&mdash;the statement justifying this breach of election promise was that `there is no clear rationale or constitutional basis for Commonwealth involvement in regional development'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker, I ask you this: this comes from a National Party member in this House, a person who is touted as a future leader of the National Party, but if the National Party does not stand for regional development what does it stand for? Yet he has come into the House and justified the abolition of $150 million of the regional infrastructure fund saying that there is no constitutional role for the Commonwealth in regional development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor believes there is a Commonwealth role in regional development. We believe that there is a role for all governments in regional development. We are sick to death of this buck&hyphen;passing between levels of government when the issues become too hard for the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The simple fact of the matter is that what is good for regional Australia is good for the nation. It therefore requires, if we are to support regional Australia, all levels of government to get behind that work. Instead, what do we see from the present government and from the minister for so-called regional development? They are washing their hands as a government of involvement in regional development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it got worse. The first budget brought down by the Treasurer (Mr Costello), on behalf of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), confirmed the approach of a massive betrayal of regional Australia. Those who rely on regional roads and infrastructure are the big losers. Higher education funding has been slashed, with the cuts falling disproportionately on the regional campuses. Assistance to the unemployed has been cut by over $1 billion, again falling heavily on regional Australia. ABC funding has been cut. There has been a massive attack on regional welfare and service delivery, with cuts in areas such as dental services. We are seeing closures of regional CES, Tax and Medicare offices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that there is an enormous sense of bewilderment and betrayal wide 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2551"> spread among regional Australians resulting from the cuts throughout regional Australia&mdash;a part of the nation that voted overwhelmingly for this government and expected better of it. But it has been dudded. It has been betrayed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to the cuts to regional infrastructure alone, first we saw in July last year this $150 million regional infrastructure fund totally abolished. I have mentioned the pretext used&mdash;there is no role for the Commonwealth in regional development, which are the words of the minister. Second, there was the axing of the infrastructure bond program with only the vague promise of a replacement program to be brought forward in the budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor indicated at the time that we would support any measure to remove unintended consequences from tax concessions. However, what we are saying is that the failure to announce a replacement program has put at risk billions of dollars of regional development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just understand the lethargy and lack of ideas resulting from this government. This issue of infrastructure bonds has been around now for over 12 months in this government's term of office. They indicated that they wanted to stop excessive use and excessive claims under the scheme. But what was the decision of the government after 12 months? It was to freeze the fund, to not allow any projects to go forward. After 12 months, having frozen 72 regional infrastructure projects, all around the country, the best that they could say is, `We'll freeze them&mdash;not that we have an alternative, not that we have really thought through a policy change; the best we can come up with after 12 months of looking at this issue is to freeze the funds, to stop further regional development occurring in this nation.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we have the scrapping of the $150 million infrastructure fund. We have the freeze now on infrastructure bonds with no alternative having been put in place. There are 72 projects sitting out there all waiting for approval&mdash;all necessary to regional development and all prepared to be financed by a combination of the private sector and government authorities. But, no, this government 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> will not allow them to go ahead. No wonder regional Australia feels you have betrayed them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not as if these are pie in the sky projects. These are essential projects to the regions of this country&mdash;road funding, infrastructure such as gas pipelines, and water supply. Yet we have a double whammy from this government: not only have they scrapped the fund that assist in getting some of these projects going but also they have scrapped the infrastructure bond program and have put nothing in place. On top of all of that, they are now coming along with the sale of the AIDC, again without any alternative being put in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sale has been announced. But there is no hint of the government's plans to do anything to address the future need for private sector investment in our national infrastructure, except perhaps the institutional investor information service, which was announced with some understated fanfare by the Minister for Regional Development. He said it was a world first, but all he did was copy the original scheme of Brian Howe, who announced it back in 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only statement made in this chamber by the minister for so-called regional development after more than a year of activity and which gives any sort of hope is something that copies Labor's plan. They have broken promises all over the place. They have told regional Australia that they would support the infrastructure funds. They have told them that they would back them in regional infrastructure. All they have done is cut the very programs that give that support, and the best they can do is copy a scheme from Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We thank you for copying Labor's scheme, but why do you not copy more of them? Why do you not reinstitute the regional development fund? Why do you not put a replacement up for the infrastructure bonds that enable these projects to go ahead? And why do you not put in place a replacement body for the AIDC to support the financing of infrastructure in important parts of this country?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The AIDC, it must be said, was involved in some significant infrastructure bond projects. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2552"> For example, the Wyuna water project, with two water treatment plants in New South Wales, was funded and backed by the AIDC. Yet it is now frozen because of the government's decision on infrastructure bonds. There is also the Oakey power station in Queensland&mdash;a 270 megawatt gas&hyphen;fired power station, essential if you are about supplying energy source to regions to enable them to value add. This, too, was frozen out by Treasurer Costello's announcement on the infrastructure bonds. The Redbank power project in the Hunter Valley&mdash;a $300 million project which uses coal tailings as fuel&mdash;is frozen. I know that the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) has serious concerns about this particular project being put on ice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What do we have from the Treasurer on this? We have an assertion that he has frozen the scheme because it was being rorted. None of these projects was a rort. I challenge the Treasurer to come into this House and identify where the rorts have been occurring. This was the same excuse he used when he wound up the syndication of research and development in this country. This is the classic dupe that Treasury and Finance always put forward. Wherever a worthwhile project overruns as to revenue forgone implications, Treasury says, `Minister, we have a submission for you. There is an overrun. Call it a rort.' Any time there is a project that is worthwhile and should be persisted with but Treasury does not like it, they get the minister all wound up and say, `Call it a rort.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what the Treasurer has done in terms of R&amp;D syndication. He has also said it in terms of infrastructure bonds, but he has not had the decency to come into this chamber on any occasion and identify and spell out those rorts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember a debate that we were having in this House towards the end of last year on the scrapping of the research and development syndication. He had to sit in the same chair as the duty minister at the table is sitting in for some six hours of debate, squirming away&mdash;signing Christmas cards, as I remember, to try to avoid attention&mdash;because we gave him the opportunity, time and time again, to get up and list the rorts. He would 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> not do it. He cringed because he knew, if he tried to do it, that he could be guilty of misleading the House. I challenge him again to come in and tell us where the rorts are in terms of the infrastructure bonds. In particular, I ask him why those three projects that I have just outlined cannot go ahead&mdash;the Wyuna water project, the Oakey power station in Queensland and the Redbank power project in the Hunter Valley. Let him explain why his mismanagement, his blinkered approach, is preventing these important aspects of regional infrastructure from proceeding to fruition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that government does have a role in renewing our regional infrastructure. We believe it does have a role in working with industry to build exports, smart research and jobs. There is still a need for the type of service that the AIDC was originally designed to provide. Although the details have changed to some extent, the need is still there, particularly because investors have a reluctance to put money into regional Australia. The AIDC moved away from that role. Unfortunately, its focus became directed to fee based merchant banking, which could just as easily be met by the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> today on page 32, we have the AIDC entering vendor finance. The simple fact of the matter is that we do not need a body to enter fees and interest charges. We do not need another body to get into vendor financing, but we do need a body that supports regional infrastructure, a body that is prepared to back these significant projects where they matter to the development of our regions, getting value&hyphen;added up, making sure we do not rely on commodities as our sole basis for exports, supporting the huge surge in manufacturing which we have seen over the last decade. These things only happen because governments are prepared to play a role. We think that there is still a role for a body to be established to perform what was originally intended and commenced by the AIDC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact of the matter is that there is a gap in patient investment capital in this country, both in relation to infrastructure investment and in meeting the needs of small high technology, export focused firms.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I'm not anticipating further cuts to government business programs because when you have a balance of payments problem the role of exports is vital.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I hope he is right, but it does sound a little bit like pre&hyphen;empting the budget process. We will find out when he returns to this parliament whether he has been successful in that regard. I hope he is more successful than in his discussion the other night at Canberra's most exclusive club with the Treasurer. There they were at the Commonwealth Club, finished dinner, and over port and cigars the Treasurer of the country and the industry minister were discussing the future of the car industry. The Treasurer said, `Minister, my vision for the car industry in this country is to wipe out Mitsubishi.' That was his plan, his secret vision for the car industry, to wipe out one of the manufacturers. This is the person who is running your government and it is about time people on the back bench stood up to him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor recognises that, to some extent, the AIDC has moved from its original charter and that the need for patient capital and private sector investment in major infrastructure projects, while just as significant, does now need to be addressed in different ways. The AIDC itself has confirmed that there is no function that it now performs which cannot be carried out equally as well by the private sector. But there still remains a significant gap in the market. The AIDC is no longer specifically focused towards filling that gap.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor sought examination of the issue through the Senate legislation committee&mdash;and that took place on Monday. It was a process which yielded some useful informa 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2554"> tion, including the fact that the legislation had been drafted without reference to the AIDC board. This is a great government of consultation. It said, `We are going to wipe you out, board members, but we will not tell you about it. We will keep it secret. We will drop it on you in the parliament. You can read about it in the newspapers.' It was only through the hearings that we had in the Senate that the board was able to flag three problems that they had with the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unless Labor had actually gone to the accountability exercise over there we would not have known about this. This government would not have sought to ask them about this. These difficulties should have been sorted out well before the legislation was tabled. It does reflect this undue haste, which the government seems to continually get itself into in introducing legislation, and its inability to manage the processes of government. Labor has a second reading amendment with regard to this legislation. I move:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On a more tempered and focused note I would like to initially reflect on the original goals of the AIDC and where the AIDC is at now. A little later I will speak about the management and board of the AIDC, which the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) raised in his speech in this second reading debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the record, AIDC Ltd is now an investment house that provides infrastructure, resources and corporate advice and financing in Australia and Asia. It is a specialist in equity investment and funds management and financial markets and securitisation. The AIDC Sale Bill, which was introduced by the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey), puts in place the commitment of the coalition government in the March 1996 election campaign to privatise AIDC Ltd.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Industry Development Corporation was set up in 1970 as a statutory corporation. Its mission was to facilitate and encourage the establishment, development and advancement of Australian industries. It is fair to say that the AIDC has had some great successes&mdash;for example, the North West Shelf gas project financing for Woodside Petroleum Ltd; the project financing for the massive Eraring power station in New South Wales; and, an issue that is very dear to the heart and mind of the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott), the establishment of a consortium of institutional investors in Optus Communications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">AIDC's business activities have expanded to fee based merchant banking activities. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, AIDC experienced some substantial losses. In 1988, the AIDC went through a colourful period, including a recognised capital shortage by the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2555"> Commonwealth government which led to the creation of AIDC Ltd and the Australian Stock Exchange listing of 19 per cent of AIDC Ltd in 1989. Of course the Commonwealth retained 81 per cent of the listed entity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For some years, and particularly during the Labor years obviously, the government talked of selling off the remaining interest in AIDC Ltd. As a result, there was great uncertainty regarding the future of the company. It is fair to say that this does have a damaging impact on the morale of staff and management and also of the board and that that may have contributed to some of the less than profitable years towards the end of the 1980s and the early 1990s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am prepared to recognise that, particularly when in the 1992-93 budget the Labor government announced its intention to sell down, to 51 per cent, the government's share in AIDC Ltd. It was in August 1992 that the government recognised that this was going to prove very difficult and withdrew the sale. In 1993-94, we saw the Labor government do a backflip yet again on another issue when it said that it was going to pursue the sale. But then in April 1994 the Labor Party said that it may change its mind in relation to the sale process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1995, the former Labor government announced that they were going to go into the market and buy back from private investors the remaining 19 per cent of AIDC Ltd, the minority shareholding. They suggested that this was going to take place so they could properly prepare AIDC Ltd for a full sale at a later date. The takeover offer closed in January 1996 and AIDC was delisted one month before the election last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The federal government wants to sell AIDC because it is a good idea. It experienced losses in the late 1980s and early 1990s. It had a profit turnaround in 1993 and significant before tax profits in each of the years since. In 1995-96, AIDC Ltd had a record $50.3 million profit, which I will talk about a little later. It is, however, not in the public interest to retain public ownership of a merchant banking operation. There are, of course, many other investment banking 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> operations in the Australian financial marketplace, but the government should not be involved in an operating business on a commercial basis in a competitive environment, especially where that competitive environment is related to the issuance of capital and the use of capital for profit purposes. This is entirely consistent with the recommendations of the National Commission of Audit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, it is fair to say that Australia enjoys very sophisticated financial markets and there is no public benefit for the Commonwealth in continuing to have an extensive involvement in the financial marketplace. For example, AIDC can enter into swaps agreements, foreign exchange agreements, forward rate agreements, option agreements, futures agreements and hedge agreements, all of which start to become complicated financial instruments once you start getting involved in derivatives of each of those and exotic agreements. These businesses have no place in the public sector other than to hedge the overall risk of the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is pursuing the competitive neutrality principle. There is an existing funding advantage for the Commonwealth, and the AIDC has enjoyed access to the Commonwealth's AAA domestic guarantee, which means that it should be an even more profitable enterprise than it is at the moment. I understand that the AIDC does not pay any guarantee fees to the Commonwealth for the benefit of enjoying the AAA status domestically and AA status on S&amp;P rating in international markets. The termination of access to the government guarantee facility will place the AIDC business where it belongs&mdash;on exactly the same footing as the rest of the financial services industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is an issue that has been brought to my attention over the last few weeks as I have been researching the sale process for AIDC Ltd. It is a matter of grave concern not just to this parliament but to all Australians, who in fact have a stake in the future of AIDC Ltd. It comes down to the fact that the AIDC management has taken a regressive approach to the sale process. AIDC management has served only its own interest during the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2556"> sale process and there is a good reason for that, which I would like to elaborate on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As of the figures of 31 December 1996, a contingent liability for employee termination is in the accounts amounting to around $32 million. This $32 million&mdash;most of which benefits around 50 of the total of 200 employees, which would be a rule of thumb application&mdash;would suggest that management has set for itself amongst the most lucrative employment contracts in the financial services industry in Australia. The company has net assets of around $246 million. So up to 15 per cent of the net asset figure would have to be allocated to the termination of employees and, particularly, senior management. That is an extraordinary figure. But it goes further.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to the 1996 annual report, the executive remuneration in AIDC Ltd has reached preposterous levels. As I referred to a little earlier, profits have improved. In 1994, the profit for AIDC Ltd was $47.3 million. In 1995, the profit was $25 million. In 1995, with a profit of $25 million, there were more than 10 executives in AIDC Ltd receiving over $700,000. More than 10 executives were receiving over $700,000 per annum in an organisation that has a total of 200 employees. That is an extraordinary figure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is even more extraordinary, if you take the levels a little bit further, that 16 people received more than $250,000, and that was on a profit figure of $25 million. On a 1996 profit figure of $50.3 million, 18 executives received more than $250,000. Some would say&mdash;and it is fair, and I agree with it&mdash;that it is only appropriate that executives should receive benefits on the basis of the profit projections. But my concern is the fact that the 1995-96 so-called profit is primarily made up of a write back of asset values and loans. So, essentially, what the management has done, or is seen to have done, is revalue everything upwards to create a profit result in 1995-96 of $50.3 million, which seems to be almost a 100 per cent improvement on the previous year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would not deny&mdash;nor would anyone, or very few, in this House&mdash;the right of senior management or talented people on the staff to have very generous salary packages based on 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the level of profit in the organisation. It is only appropriate in the financial services sector and particularly in the markets, where there are extraordinary pressures on individuals and there is extraordinary risk associated with decisions made less than every minute of every hour of every day. There are only too many examples where imprudent financial management has caused grave harm to organisations such as Barings, more recently Natwest in the United Kingdom, and a few other organisations. I think it was Nomura that was the unfortunate recipient of a billion dollar mistake.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But when salary levels are pitched at such a high point and the underlying profit of an organisation does not indicate that they should be, then what they are doing is ripping off the shareholder. And that is exactly what the AIDC management have done. They have ripped off the shareholder by taking such excessive salaries and putting in place extraordinary termination agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1996, $25.9 million was the total salary package for AIDC Ltd&mdash;this puts it in perspective&mdash;and yet their termination agreements and the contingent liability in the accounts is $32 million, which would indicate that every employee in AIDC Ltd is guaranteed more than an entire year's salary for termination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You and I know, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the hardworking personal assistant or hardworking secretary or the young employee who is running to and from the market or doing the courier service or working in the photocopy room is not going to get a year's salary. So what does that mean about the senior executives' termination payments?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And even now we need to ask the question: what is the motivation of the management and the board in impeding the smooth process to due diligence during the sale process? I will tell you what it is. It is an underlying arrogance. Professor Jeremy Davis was quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 18 March as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The real core of AIDC's business lies in the relationship with our 80 to 100 clients. The exercise of this right to information could be damaging to the company. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2557">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The report goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Professor Davis said AIDC was not looking for a veto but a limit to the due diligence process for buyers.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Professor Davis is showing an extraordinary arrogance and a lack of understanding of the most basic sale principles for any financial institution. Professor Davis seems to have forgotten some of the lessons of the past. The State Bank of Victoria was never sold to the Commonwealth Bank&mdash;they never went through any due diligence process. The State Bank of South Australia was never sold to Advance Bank&mdash;they never went through any due diligence process. Bankwest was never sold to the Bank of Scotland&mdash;they never went through any due diligence process. The Commonwealth Bank was never sold to the markets&mdash;they never went through any due diligence process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And it goes on. State Bank was never sold to Colonial&mdash;there was no due diligence process. Metway was never sold into the Bank of Queensland and the Queensland government&mdash;there was no due diligence process. And it goes on and on and on. And the Chairman of AIDC Ltd has the absolute hide to come into this parliament and tell the Senate committee that the due diligence process might unveil confidential information about customers. He either does not understand the most basic  processes of due diligence or he is guilty of the most heinous crime of obstructing the obvious will of the shareholders&mdash;the people of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If Professor Davis is not going to comply with the demands of this parliament and the demands of the shareholder, then he should resign and take his entire board with him. Because what he is doing is saying to us that AIDC should be absolutely separate from the normal processes of sale, including the due diligence process, which will reveal the true value of the asset.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have indicated, AIDC's profit result last year was not that good. They have chosen to revalue a few assets and inflated the profit figure but the underlying profit is disappointing&mdash;given that it has a AAA guarantee, which only three banks in the world have; only three banks in the entire world have an 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> international AAA guarantee. And AIDC's  domestic AAA and international AA give them significant benefits; yet on assets of $256 million last year their profit was $50.3 million with some revaluations tied in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On behalf of the people in my electorate and on behalf of the people in this House, I urge AIDC management to make a contribution to the sale process. The only message I am hearing&mdash;and I am standing on the sidelines&mdash;is that AIDC management are impeding at every point the smooth sale process. You know why? Because they have set up for themselves the most cosy executive remuneration contracts anywhere in the markets. They like their cosy little arrangement&mdash;their AAA guarantee, their wonderful termination payments, their wonderful remuneration payments. They do not even have to rely on substantial underlying profits to deliver them good remuneration. It is greedy and it is grubby! The sooner AIDC is sold into the market, the sooner it will be accustomed to real market pressures, the sooner the executives of AIDC will realise that the gravy train cannot continue, especially at the expense of the people of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I call on the management of AIDC Ltd to lift their game. I warn them that not only am I am watching them, not only are the bidders carefully watching them, not only are the government and this House watching them but the market is watching them&mdash;and we are watching them very closely. If they are going to have that sort of attitude in this process, they are going to find it very hard to survive either the sale process or any process after that.</PARA></SPEECH>

Let me say a couple things about the contribution from the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey). It is all very well for the honourable member to draw these very serious concerns, which we agree with, about the operations of the AIDC and its management, but what does the AIDC Sale Bill 1997 provide to deal with your concerns?

We do not agree with that philosophically, politically and in terms of the economic development of this nation because the fundamental issue facing this nation at the moment is employment and unemployment. In order to effectively deal with that issue, we have to deal with the question of industry development. Industry policy is the crucial issue facing this House. It is a shame that it is so poorly addressed at the moment, with the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) not having a clue, not having any ideas and not having any suggestions.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> about the AIDC and the amendment moved by the opposition. We are saying in our amendment that we reaffirm a commitment to the principles underpinning the AIDC's creation. It might be reflective to talk about that for a moment. A document from the Parliamentary Library refers to the purposes for which the AIDC was formed. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AIDC was established in 1970 . . . the initiative of the Rt Hon. J. McEwen, then Minister for Trade and Industry, who saw the need to counter Australia's growing dependence on foreign capital to support its enterprises and industries. The AIDC is an investment bank which finances Australian industries and which also participates in enterprises and projects. McEwen was not opposed to foreign investment <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">per se</EMPHASIS>  and, in fact, he acknowledged the importance of the availability of such capital in Australia. The AIDC was created to assist Australian residents match the share of capital required to create or maintain enterprises so as to avoid too often becoming the minor partner in an enterprise which was the target of foreign investment or takeover. At that time, the Australian motor industry was nearly 90% foreign controlled. The industrial and heavy chemicals industry, and the pharmaceuticals industries were over 80% foreign controlled. Overseas ownership of the electrical and electronic industries was around 50%.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AIDC was created to fill a gap not then adequately covered by the banking and other financial lenders. The AIDC was there to assist in cases where the development would not otherwise take place, or would not be possible in circumstances where, unless local finance was available, ownership and control would go to foreign investors.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">A piece of history, Mr Deputy Speaker. We believe those general underlying principles of the AIDC are still relevant. But the government, in getting rid of the AIDC, is not putting in place any structure which addresses the failure of Australia's capital markets to provide sufficient long-term patient funds for industry development. It does not address that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a critical issue for us as a nation, as a people. We have to develop more broadly and, as the shadow minister said, develop our industries throughout the regions of Australia, otherwise our future as a nation is going to be glum. We must do more in industry development but, without an organisation or a structure that takes up this task, it is going to be very difficult. So we condemn the government 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2559"> for not doing enough, not thinking enough and not putting into place sufficient policies to help develop a structure of this kind that can assist in the injection of capital. There is no doubt that the government does not see any such need because according to the second reading speech:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since its establishment as a company AIDC has been changing the direction of the business activity of the company. While still focusing on the development or advancement of the infrastructure and resource sectors of the economy, it is pursuing to a far greater extent fee-based merchant banking business. This government is firmly of the view that such activities have no place continuing in the public sector.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is the explanation that we get in the second reading speech when we try to understand what the government is on about in terms of this concern with the financing industry. It is interesting to look at what the philosophical basis of this concern is. The second reading speech also says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government's decision to sell the AIDC Limited is consistent with the recommendations of the National Commission of Audit which considered that government business activities whose objectives are to provide goods and services on a commercial basis should only be retained in public ownership if there is a clear public interest case to do so. With the emergence and development of financial markets in Australia any public interest case to retain the AIDC in public ownership has disappeared.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">First of all, I suppose that means they think that the provision of capital is a good or service. That is interesting. Whoever wrote this perhaps should go back and look at their economics texts. It seems to them that the provision of capital is a good or service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They do not understand the fact that the banking sector does not sufficiently lend in regional areas, in risk areas, in new areas and in innovative areas. Yet in this country we have the problem that we have a large number of skilled people, a very highly skilled work force, but we do not have enough industry for them to be employed in. Is it because we do not have the general idea of what to do? Couldn't we in Australia produce whitegoods? Couldn't we in Australia produce electronic products? Couldn't we in Australia produce more telecommunications? Couldn't we in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australia have more processing of minerals? Couldn't we in Australia have more processing of food? Couldn't we in Australia have a whole range of other industries? Of course we could. Why don't we have a structure or a body which can actually help at least in the initial stages?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a matter that is going to have to be taken up at some point or another. I can tell you that we on this side of the House are determined to push this issue about industry development over and over again. If the government is not prepared to put into place a minister who is going to listen and who is going to be at least interested in the issues, if the government is not going to be prepared to actually start thinking in innovative ways about how we can proactively get our industries going, then we are going to be in a lot of strife. But we are going to make this an issue at the next election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson), who is at the table, knows what I am talking about because we were recently in a parliamentary delegation that visited the Republic of Ireland. It was very instructive to see what can be done because in the Republic of Ireland they have converted from an agriculturally based economy 20 years ago&mdash;20 years ago only&mdash;into an economy based on high technology industries. And not only that; they have actually been able to develop those industries in the regions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How have they done that? Do you think they have done it by allowing everything to enter the free market without government intervention? On the contrary. As the honourable member for Ballarat knows, we were all stunned to see the number of concessions and the number of active policies that were put into place by a government owned organisation designed to achieve manufacturing, high technology industries regionally based in Ireland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I am not saying that all of these industries would be possible in Australia. By the way, we thought some of these were against the World Trade Organisation until we discovered how much you can actually do in the investment area. For example, some companies investing in manufacturing in Ireland have a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2560"> reduced corporate tax rate to 10 per cent up to the year 2010. They are able to have a reduced tax for investment. There is a whole range of other initiatives&mdash;tax-free repatriation of profits in certain circumstances, tax exempt government securities, capital allowances and expenditure on scientific research&mdash;all sorts of measures put into place to ensure that you get the kind of investment that is required in industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another serious aspect to this issue, and we have had quite a few serious aspects raised so far. We also had the serious questions raised by the honourable member for North Sydney. I look forward to seeing what the minister intends to put into place to deal with the issues he raised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are also the matters raised by the honourable member for Hotham&mdash;the problem we face as a nation with so many regions spread out geographically, so many different places that need small and medium sized industries, industries where our people can work. Are you saying in the context of that that we do not need some kind of organisation? We certainly don't need the currently operating AIDC with all of its problems. But we need an organisation that is going to achieve those results.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unless we hear some answers from the government, we are going to be not only insisting on our amendment, but we are going to be keeping them on their toes over and over and saying, `What are you going to do about a structure to provide capital for industry?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other amendments that we are foreshadowing for after the second reading debate stage have to do with the Australian Submarine Corporation. What is the government going to do about the Australian Submarine Corporation? This is a very serious question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the shadow minister for industry, the member for Hotham, has said, the opposition asked a few questions about this in the Senate committee hearings. It is instructive to read the text of key questions raised by Senator Robert Ray:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senator ROBERT RAY</EMPHASIS> &mdash;Minister, you would realise that the Australian Submarine Corporation was designed to always have an Australian majority

<PARA STYLE="Para">that is the sale of the AIDC&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">of the Australian Submarine Corporation being owned in the majority overseas?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senator Kemp</EMPHASIS> &mdash;That is not the government's intention, Senator Ray.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senator ROBERT RAY</EMPHASIS> &mdash;It is not the government's intention but is there a possibility of that if AIDC is purchased in part by foreign owners and you do not actually transfer their holding of the Australian Submarine outside it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senator Kemp</EMPHASIS> &mdash;No. The advice I have is that that is not the government's intention and, clearly, if there was a potential problem in the area the submarine would be pulled out of the sale.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senator ROBERT RAY</EMPHASIS> &mdash;Have you identified an area that you would transfer the asset to?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">An official answers:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr Hutchinson</EMPHASIS> &mdash;The proposition is that the asset initially be held by the Australian Industry Development Corporation&mdash;the statutory authority&mdash;which would need to continue in operation for some time to manage the borrowings that are still in place and that run for some considerable period. So, in the first case, the corporation would hold the shares but it is possible to vest them elsewhere in the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senator ROBERT RAY</EMPHASIS> &mdash;Would you have any idea where else you could invest those shares?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr Hutchinson</EMPHASIS> &mdash;They could be vested in the Commonwealth directly so that the Department of Defence could hold them, or any other government agency so nominated by the administrative arrangements orders could hold them, or they could be vested in another Commonwealth entity, another Commonwealth GBE, if that was thought appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senator ROBERT RAY</EMPHASIS> &mdash;There would be a great deal of awkwardness if it went to the Department of Defence because then it would be part owner and client, similar to the problems they have with Australian Defence Industries. You would have to put up all sorts of Chinese walls. Where else in the government, apart from Defence, do you think you could vest them to avoid those problems?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr Hutchinson</EMPHASIS> &mdash;If they were merely a financial asset they could be vested with the Department of Finance or the Department of Industry, Science and Tourism if that was appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is the key point:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2561">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ministers have given no consideration beyond the possibility that they could be held in corporation for some time.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are speaking on the bill that allows the Australian Industry Development Corporation Ltd to be sold off. We have had the member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey) on the government side intervene in this debate. I would just like to extend a general apology that there are no other government members speaking on the debate and, particularly, no National Party members.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find it extraordinary that no National Party member is sufficiently motivated by the current pressing issues of this bill or the history of the bill, because the AIDC was established when Black Jack McEwen was Minister for Trade and Industry. I would have thought they would have wanted some pride of ownership on this and to make some comments about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting that, when it was set up back in 1970, it was proposed as a mechanism for countering Australia's dependence on foreign capital to support its enterprises and its industry. That was a very worthwhile thing in 1970 and I make the point that it has remained as relevant in the 1980s and 1990s as it was in the 1970s. From our perspective on this side of the House, we are unapologetic about wanting to say that we support processes and mechanisms that allow Australian industry to grow and not to be owned by or dependent on foreign capital.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is ironic that we are supporting a measure to effectively privatise something owned by the Commonwealth. But, like a number of organisations, this institution, regrettably, has long departed from the original vision and aims that were had for it. That is a matter of regret, but it is the reality. So, in selling off AIDC, we are not selling something that is countering Australia's growing dependence on foreign capital to support enterprise and industry. This is not an organisation that is supporting technological breakthroughs any more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things the AIDC can rightly claim some credit for is the fact that it funded the Nucleus Techtronics pacemaker. We need an Australian institution that is prepared to fund breakthroughs&mdash;the pacemaker, the cochlear ear implant or whatever the next generation of exciting products developed by our scientists and researchers may be. We do not have that institution. It is a great tragedy that, in a country so relatively small in size, we are and always have been capable of doing good research and providing breakthroughs but we have not been good at product development and getting things onto the market. In particular, all too often we have not been good at keeping things in Australian hands. People are getting more and more upset about this, as they understand that when these things go overseas or are bought out by foreigners, the jobs and the benefits go with them in the majority of cases. We have done all the hard yards to have that research breakthrough but another foreign company in another country will get all the benefits of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, when AIDC was funding projects like the pacemaker, it was a very important institution to us on this side of the House, but critically important to innovative Australian industry. They have had some other very important investments&mdash;and I want to talk about one in particular in some detail&mdash;but they have long since gone away from that role. If you read today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, it talks about the AIDC entering vendor finance and wanting to get into deep partnership, but that will not be for the things that John McEwen had in mind&mdash;that is, countering foreign investment. It will not be pumping a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2562"> lot of money into these companies or doing something that a lot of other companies are doing already. So that is why I am speaking&mdash;with regret&mdash;in support of the bill, in principle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to read the second reading amendment moved by the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean). That says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, and recognising that there were difficulties associated with the way the AIDC had moved from its original charter, this House:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> reaffirms its commitment to the principles underpinning the AIDC's</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">That amendment sums it all up. We hope that on the government side they will exhibit a concern for and interest in Australian industry, funding the development and the product stage of research and development&mdash;although they have cut back research and development&mdash;assisting innovative Australian companies to grow, to develop and to export.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We cannot say, `The banks will look after it: we have banks and they do those things.' They have an appalling record. They are the most impatient providers of capital. In the farming sector, it has been an absolute tragedy to see customers who have had relationships of 20 to 30 years&mdash;or even generations&mdash;with one bank, only to see that bank squeeze them out of their property and inheritance. They have done that to the farming sector and to industry as well. I regret both events. We cannot look to the banks&mdash;they are failing us&mdash;and so we need to look to other institutions. I sincerely hope that the government will consider these issues seriously, because, after all, they are concerned with Australian jobs.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I particularly wanted to talk about the Australian Submarine Corporation. I suppose that in the heat of political debate lots may be said about a member of parliament. But when Kim Beazley was Minister for Defence he had an outstanding record of achievement, which I think no-one really disputes. I wanted to talk about what he did on the industry side. There were decisions made on things like transforming the docks down in Victoria and getting Transfield up and running and giving them the frigate project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the Submarine Corporation a huge decision was made that, `No, we just won't sign up to an American submarine, a British submarine, a German submarine, or whatever. We want self&hyphen;reliance in Australia and we are going to build the submarine in Australia.' In fact it was in South Australia. That was a huge decision, a gutsy decision, and a quite right decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to quibble with that decision. But if you were to look at one element that you would wish to revisit, it would be the fact that there was not a majority Australian owner. The reason I say that is that the Submarine Corporation has never had the same ambitions for exports or exporting the submarine as I believe those who made the original decisions would have envisaged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What was the Australian institution that funded the 48.5 per cent shareholding? It was the AIDC. Is it not a tragedy that you could not get the Commonwealth Bank, the National Bank, the ANZ or the super funds to come into such an important project in the national interest that added skills and technology exponentially to our defence capability and self&hyphen;reliance? We could not get any one of those; we had to get the AIDC. So if there is now another purchase of important equipment&mdash;and the current Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan) says that it is vital, in the defence of Australia, in terms of self&hyphen;reliance, that we have this capability in country&mdash;who is going to fund it? Regrettably, there is no institution. That is why I say to the government that we need to think in terms of developing an institution that could fulfil that role, if not others.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2563">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I say, it was a huge decision to build the submarine in Australia. I think the Submarine Corporation have done brilliantly. But my one area of criticism is the fact that they have failed to get into exports. I may even be as ungenerous to suggest that somehow Swedish options from Sweden seem to be more vigorously pushed in our region than were Australian Submarine Corporation options. What was the reason for that? We really never had tight enough control.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most amazing thing about this bill to sell off the AIDC is that Kockums still has pre-emptive rights to buy out the AIDC shareholding. So, in other words, if you want to privatise the AIDC, including its shareholding in the Submarine Corporation, you actually have to give Kockums the first right of refusal. I would have thought that that was a difficult process. I do not really think that the government has thought through well how it is going to warehouse it. It may be a matter of, `We can put it here&mdash;Finance; we can put it in industry and science&mdash;DIST; or we can warehouse it some other way.' I would have thought that in relation to Australian taxpayer funds the people of Australia would expect the government of the day to more seriously consider the implications of this move and to have a very clearly thought out approach to this problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am going to be followed in this debate by the honourable member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson), who has got some important contributions to make to this debate&mdash;I might say almost scandalous. Mr Deputy Speaker, you are in the chair, so this is not directed at you, but it is disappointing to me that there is no National Party member making a contribution to this debate, given that Black Jack McEwen was the minister who actually established the AIDC, for reasons that I think were commendable in 1970 and for purposes in the 1970s which are still valid today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, when I go around my electorate&mdash;I do not know what it is like in yours&mdash;people are concerned about the amount of foreign ownership. They are worried that there are not enough Australian owned companies. They feel that we as parliamentarians are not doing enough to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> assist, to push up and develop and grow our Australian owned companies and get them bigger and get them employing more Australians in jobs. This was one of the roles that Black Jack McEwen saw for the AIDC. But it has moved away from that original objective and vision, and that is why we on this side of the House are supporting its sale. So in particular I support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Hotham and I support the bill.    </PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There has been a role for the AIDC. As other speakers pointed out, it was originally established to meet real needs in this community, particularly the reluctance of investors to put their money into regional Australia. Many of us would think that there is still a need for the type of service that the AIDC was originally established to provide. But, as other speakers have also pointed out, it has moved away from that role and its focus on fee based merchant banking can just as readily be met by private sector banks. Therefore, the case for it remaining in the public sector diminishes accordingly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to say that I think AIDC has lost its way in the last two or three years because of the focus of its own management on looking after themselves rather than looking after the purposes for which AIDC was established. Back in October 1995 there was considerable public comment and public concern expressed at the salary increases awarded by senior executives of AIDC to themselves of more than 200 per cent in a single year. The Managing Director of AIDC at the time, Mr Gerry van der Merwe, according to the Sunday <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>, was paid a salary of $1.8 million, making him the second highest paid executive in the country. As I understand it, his salary was in fact $1.8 million, but he received $400,000 in options as well, which took him over the $2 million mark and made him the highest paid executive in the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Sunday <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> compared him with BHP's chief executive who received $1.9 million. But, on the other hand, BHP had a staff of 49,000 and a profit in excess of $1 billion, whereas AIDC had a staff of only 200 and a profit of $28 million. Mr van der Merwe's 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2564"> salary had been boosted from $320,000 to $1.8 million in a period when the bank's profits fell from $46 million to $28 million. It is little wonder that Senator Peter Cook said at the time that he was astonished at the level of wage increases awarded to him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was not just the managing director who was being paid these extraordinary salaries. By the end of 1995, the 10 highest paid executives at AIDC were earning between $700,000 and $1.8 million each. Their pay packets corresponded to 36 per cent of AIDC's after tax profits&mdash;a truly extraordinary amount when the company was only earning those small profits and only earning those small profits when it was the beneficiary of a government guarantee. This was at a time when the senior executives had sought and gained what were referred to as golden handcuff payments. They said they had to be paid these additional amounts of money because there was uncertainty surrounding the merchant bank's future. But it seems to me, looking at the AIDC figures, that the huge percentage which was ripped off for those top salaries meant that the company was in a considerably worse position than if they had left the company. In any event, Mr van der Merwe received two retention payments&mdash;the second of which was $400,000&mdash;and he resigned one week after receiving that second retention payment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">AIDC's profits were $28 million in 1994, $43 million in 1993 and $46 million in 1992 against a background where they had a preferential interest rate as a AAA rated beneficiary of the federal guarantee. So all they had to do was take money and lend it on to the National Bank, making use of the guarantee in order to make a return. The management in place at that time failed to generate new income streams and lived off the diminishing returns of the old AIDC income and that income was based on a continuously falling asset base. In my view, this amounted to a straight rip&hyphen;off of the taxpayer and amounted to conduct like kids in a candy shop.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is against that background&mdash;of executives having negotiated uncommercial retention packages for themselves and highly profitable 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> golden handshakes&mdash;that I think we have to ask a number of questions now surrounding the sale to ensure that the public interest will be protected. I for one am interested in knowing what assets AIDC has sold since the 1996 election and for what value; how do those sales prices compare with an independent assessment of the market value of those assets which have been sold; have there been independent assessments of market value; and was there a commercial reason for the asset to be sold when it was? It is certainly my understanding that bonuses being paid to AIDC executives related to asset sales. So AIDC had a motivation to sell assets, particularly prior to 30 June, irrespective of whether it was getting full value for money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we need to understand whether there have been independent assessments of those asset sales. We also need to understand what kinds of golden handshakes or contracts for senior management are now in place. Would it be the case that we may get a lower price for the sale of AIDC due to lucrative golden handshakes and contracts for senior management in the event that the new owner of AIDC decides to get rid of the senior managers? Based on the retention payments that occurred in the past, it is quite possible that we would have arrangements in place whereby management gets golden handshakes of such a size that they would tend to diminish the price for AIDC. In my view these are important questions, and I would like to hear responses from the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) before this debate is concluded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">AIDC currently employs 200 people. While, as I have indicated, Labor does not want to see generous golden handshakes go to AIDC senior management, we are concerned that ordinary workers in the organisation are not disadvantaged by the sale. It is my understanding that concerns were expressed about this during the Senate committee hearings on Monday. I am pleased, as other opposition members would be, that assurances have now been given that the existing terms and conditions of employment for these workers will be maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">AIDC is one of two Australian controlled independent investment houses. It is likely 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2565"> that through this sale it will be purchased by overseas interests. There are no special provisions in the bill to deal with foreign ownership. Against this background, Labor notes the assurances of Senator Kemp that, if the buyer is overseas owned, AIDC's 48.5 per cent holding in the Australian Submarine Corporation could be excluded from the sale. We believe that better assurances should be given, and the amendment we will move to this bill goes to this point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will move that the ASC be removed from AIDC Ltd and be located within the AIDC corporation, which is to stay in place to manage the borrowings and loan portfolio and to manage such national interest assets as the Commonwealth's Australian Submarine Corporation shareholding. That would ensure that the Australian Submarine Corporation does not become foreign controlled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to express some concern about the sale of the AIDC. While the points for the sale are understood by the opposition and we are not opposing the sale, if there is no effort to replace the AIDC, that does form part of a pattern of conduct by this government which is detrimental to regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen $150 million cut from regional infrastructure projects. That was justified by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, John Sharp, on the grounds that there was no clear rationale or constitutional basis for Commonwealth involvement in regional development. In other words, he was saying, `We are washing our hands of involvement in regional development.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also seen a budget which impacted massively on regional Australia. So people who relied on regional roads and infrastructure, people who relied on higher education&mdash;because the cuts fell disproportionately on regional campuses&mdash;and people who relied on assistance to the unemployed have all been massively disadvantaged. ABC funding was cut. There were massive attacks on regional welfare, with the closure of regional CES, tax and Medicare offices. Against that background, it is a matter of concern that the government looks to have some appropriate 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> replacement for AIDC to continue investment in regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do want to repeat the concerns I expressed earlier in my speech, and I want to raise those questions about the kinds of golden handshakes which are involved for AIDC management and the kinds of asset sales that have been engaged in in recent times. What we have had is a situation where AIDC management knew it was the government's intention to sell AIDC&mdash;so they knew they were going&mdash;and, therefore, there was no incentive for them to behave in a way which was in the best interests of AIDC or the best interests of the taxpayer. It really was a situation which encouraged kids in the candy store behaviour. I am anxious to hear from the government the full details of arrangements concerning golden handshakes and asset sales which have been conducted during the past 12 months.</PARA></SPEECH>

If he is really all that interested in it, I refer him to my speech on the sale of the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories in October 1993.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like briefly to address that aspect. I am quite happy to stand here in support of the second reading amendment moved by the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) and indicate that we understand the reasons behind the government's decision to proceed with the sale, but we do not understand the total reasons as they were explained in the second reading speech.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reliance in the second reading speech on the support this sale has from the National Commission of Audit is one aspect that would cause me great concern. The nature of that comment by the National Commission of Audit is to indicate that perhaps a government has no business in the types of activities that the AIDC involves itself in. I think there can 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2566"> be, in various ways, a case put for government involvement in a whole range of activities and that we should not shy away from that. They should be considered just as much as any of the alternatives that government has before it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, you would understand the historical links and involvement of government activity in public enterprises, such as railways and other public utilities. As was said earlier in this debate, government ownership and involvement in activities like that has been very important, especially to the regions of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we have gone through the sales we have had over the past few years, one of the arguments that has always been put is that the historical basis for government ownership of such organisations as the Commonwealth Bank or Qantas is no longer applicable&mdash;things have changed, and the nature of those organisations has changed. To a certain extent in the case of the AIDC, that is the basis for the reasoning on the move towards the total sale.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of AIDC, it has acknowledged that it has moved away from its original charter. We should also look at that. In 1997 we should be looking at the reasons why the AIDC was created some 20 to 30 years ago and whether those reasons still obtain. We should look at vehicles like the AIDC as being important alternatives for involvement of government in ensuring that there is adequate fund provision for a whole host of projects, most particularly, as the shadow minister has said, infrastructure development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An article in this morning's Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> discusses the superannuation tax&mdash;the so-called superannuation surcharge&mdash;and its unintended effect on the ability for funds managers to invest in major infrastructure projects. It indicates that the funds managers have some concern that their ability to provide funding will even further dry up, and we can take that in the context of the likelihood of the infrastructure bonds being scrapped. What needs to be asked is: how are we going to find these alternative sources of funding to ensure that major projects, the likes of which the AIDC has been involved in, and which 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have been outlined in this debate, will continue?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said, I do not believe that the process of privatisation itself will make an organisation any more efficient. I do not believe that it is somehow inherent in the nature of the private sector to always do things more efficiently and effectively. I believe that there is always a role for government ownership as a form of government intervention in the economy, whether it be to achieve important social objectives that the private sector will not deliver on or because of the benefit in terms of the revenue that flows to government. Telstra is an example that fulfils both of these categories. I note in this context that the AIDC has provided more than $130 million in dividend payments since 1983.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that about my concerns of public ownership vis&hyphen;a&hyphen;vis private ownership, some of the criticisms that have been made about the AIDC in government ownership likewise indicate that, on occasions, we have to be vigilant that organisations in government ownership do the right thing as well. The issue that has been raised most notably by the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey) and the honourable member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson) is the matter of executive salaries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have to say, having listened to the honourable member for North Sydney in his considered consideration of those matters, that the real danger is that this is symptomatic not just of behaviour within the AIDC as an organisation but of executive salaries across the board. This is an issue that I have taken up on other occasions. I do not believe that we can finger one organisation for what appears to be exorbitant behaviour in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The whole matter of executive salaries is a matter that government, on behalf of the people of Australia, should be looking into. It is something we should be doing all we can to put a cap on. If it is good enough for ordinary workers to have to put in work value cases to justify pay increases and to justify their level of remuneration, there should 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2567"> likewise be mechanisms that ensure executive salaries have the same constraints.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is expected that government business enterprises perform to the same standards that are required in the private sector. As I have just suggested, it does not mean that they have to perform to the same low standards on some important matters. The selling of an enterprise in itself will not make the enterprise any more effective in doing what it does. There is no reason why these objectives are not able to be achieved in full public ownership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The measures required to bring a government business enterprise to what is considered to be a more competitive standard can be just as easily implemented with the organisation remaining in full public ownership. A public enterprise is a way for governments to promote certain social objectives and act as models for private sector businesses in areas such as progressive industrial relations or providing goods or services to disadvantaged customers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Privatisation always fails to take into account the fact that government business enterprises are often created to fill a need that was not being met by the private sector. This was the case with the former government's business enterprises like the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, which was designed to protect Australia's national interests by ensuring that Australia did not have to rely on other countries for sera and vaccines. This was the case when the Commonwealth moved into the area of telecommunications to ensure that all Australians had equal access to communications. I note that this is something which can no longer be guaranteed now that Telstra is to be partially privatised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the context of a debate about public ownership, I also have urged governments of, now, both persuasions to look at areas that they should pick up on. At the time when they are divesting themselves of ownership in certain areas, there is likewise a need to consider the important areas in the 1990s, going into the next century, where government can have a role.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently in a discussion about the cable roll-outs of both Optus and Telstra, I, in not 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> just a flippant way, said that perhaps what we needed to do was nationalise the cables. If the cables were in direct government control, with access to the cables then being on&hyphen;sold to the telecommunication companies, we would have had greater control originally and could have greater control about the way in which they fulfil community expectations, the way in which it is an environmentally sensitive issue, the way in which they fulfil the necessary expectations about their capacity and the way in which they would be able to bring things into households.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The banking sector did not adequately provide the necessary capital to finance industries. This was the rationale behind the establishment of the Australian Industry Development Corporation back in 1970. It was envisaged that, in a case where development would not proceed, or would only proceed with ownership and control going to foreign investors, the AIDC could step in. The AIDC has a 48.5 per cent holding in the Australian Submarine Corporation. The rationale behind this investment was the same&mdash;there needed to be Australian investment in an undertaking of such national significance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue of possible foreign ownership of such a vital holding as a result of AIDC's privatisation is of concern. As a consequence of this legislation, the AIDC could end up being controlled by foreign investors. While the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp) has given undertakings that the Australian Submarine Corporation holding could be removed from the sale should this prove to be the case, the opposition would like to see that stated more clearly in the legislation. Therefore, the opposition will move an amendment, in the consideration in detail stage of the debate, which would ensure that the Australian Submarine Corporation holding will be removed from the AIDC and that it will not end up in foreign hands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a clear example of my concern. Whilst the market forces apply in this&mdash;and market forces are all important&mdash;they do not necessarily act in the national interest. Market forces actually act in the interests of the market. Given that there has been a  global 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2568"> isation of our economy and an integration into the international economy, we cannot be sure that, without proper instruments of intervention by government, market forces will prevail in the national interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When considering the privatisation of the AIDC, the original objectives of the organisation should be re-examined. The AIDC was established in 1970, as I said, to promote the development of Australian industry and Australian participation in it. There is agreement from both sides of this place that the AIDC has shifted away significantly from the original function that it performed. While the AIDC has progressively moved away from this over time to a more fee based merchant banking institution, the government needs to look at alternative methods of assistance. The movement away from its original role has been further exemplified in an article in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> headed `AIDC enters into vendor finance', which the member for Hotham has referred to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In privatising the Australian Industry Development Corporation, the government should not think this action absolves them of responsibility for assisting industry to access capital. This is because the problems facing many Australian companies in gaining access to capital still remain, and, as I have suggested, perhaps are getting much worse. The result of this is that many projects get under way only because of foreign investment, if at all. Given the government's current attempts to remove itself from every aspect of industry policy, I do not hold out much hope of the government recognising this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because the AIDC has moved away from its original objectives, it is now appropriate for the government to examine the creation of an organisation or an instrument that is more in keeping with the AIDC's original function or look at other measures designed to assist business in gaining access to capital. There is certainly a need for an organisation which has as its function the provision of finance for promoting and developing Australian industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When one looks at some of the infrastructure projects that the AIDC has been involved in, such as the two water treatment plants in New South Wales, one sees that in many 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cases they are projects of national significance. The government must ensure that a mechanism exists which allows such vitally important projects to be funded, and invested in, when they otherwise might not. One of the functions that the AIDC has under section 8A allowed the minister to provide the funds for investment in special projects deemed to be in the national interest. The sale of the AIDC will lose a vehicle that the minister had at hand to ensure that that could be so. It definitely would be in the national interest to have this function transferred to another body or taken up directly by the government itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said at the outset, I support the second reading amendment moved by the honourable member for Hotham on the basis that it reaffirms the commitment of this House to the principles underpinning AIDC's creation and, further, condemns the government for not putting in place a structure which will address the failure of the capital markets to provide the sort of funding that the AIDC historically had provided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is now time that the government, through whichever minister wishes to take the reins&mdash;perhaps members in this debate are fast losing faith in the industry minister to provide adequate leadership&mdash;ensures that Australian industries continue to be able to not only maintain their market shares internationally but also grow, and ensures that we will not see further losses of Australian jobs offshore in important industrial sectors like pharmaceuticals and TCF.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For instance, I was told, from a briefing given to the opposition yesterday, that if the TCF tariffs are to go to zero levels early in the next century it would lead to a loss of 700 jobs in one of the municipalities in my electorate. I can assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that in my electorate we cannot afford to lose one job. There are thousands of people who are ready, willing and able to take up worthwhile employment. The government has to recognise that there are many regions, such as the electorate that I represent, that need the assistance and intervention from government to ensure that Australian industry prospers.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have listened to the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2569"> debate today and appreciate that there is a universal view that the subject of the AIDC Sale Bill, AIDC Ltd, is pursuing business activities which make it no longer appropriate to be maintained by government ownership. Whatever the benefit of this particular organisation when it was established&mdash;a number of speakers in the course of this debate have referred to various projects that were of benefit to the community generally in an infrastructure sense&mdash;it has long past being useful. It has lost its way somewhat simply because of the fact that there has been a deregulation of banking and there are other facilities available for the type of infrastructure that AIDC once supported.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The judgment that this business is not appropriate for government is one that has been held by both sides of the House&mdash;by the current government and by is predecessors&mdash;for a number of years. Sale measures had been initiated previously, but had not met with much success. The lessons from those previous actions have been learned and led to the legislation currently before the House which will enable this government to bring the sale of AIDC Ltd and its associated business activities to a successful conclusion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will be opposing the opposition's amendments relating to the Australian Submarine Corporation holding. I made it clear during the second reading speech that the ASC holding would be quarantined from the sale. Therefore, this amendment is unnecessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation was necessary because the existing legislative framework governing the operations of the Australian Industry Development Corporation did not provide the flexibility that is necessary to conclude a sale on satisfactory terms and conditions. In addition, despite the successful takeover proposal conducted by the corporation for the shares it did not own in AIDC Ltd, minority shareholdings in the company continued to exist for technical reasons. With the passage of this bill, it will be possible to deal with those holdings in an expeditious manner without in any way compromising the fair and equitable treatment of those shareholders. The bill clearly makes provision to protect the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> interests of those parties, consistent with the obligations set out in the constitution for the compulsory acquisition of property.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another fundamental issue dealt with by the bill is that it provides the appropriate legal environment for the substantial financial interests of the Commonwealth to be managed both during and after the sale process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A significant characteristic of the business activities of AIDC Ltd has been the added protection afforded its borrowings through the use of the Commonwealth guarantee. With the sale of the company, or its assets, the Commonwealth will continue to stand behind the guarantees that it has already provided, but in so doing it is necessary to ensure that the Australian Industry Development Corporation is provided with the appropriate legislative base to continue that task. The bill provides that base.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Concern has been expressed by the board of AIDC Ltd in relation to the power provided by this bill for the minister to require the provision of information to assist in the sale process. The concern was expressed on the basis that that may impact on the company's client relationship. I can assure the House that this power will not be used lightly by the government. The Commonwealth will be mindful of the need to protect commercially sensitive material and will ensure that commercial interests are not prejudiced during the sale process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill makes provision for the protection of information obtained under this arrangement. However, it is also important to ensure that the Commonwealth's actions, as the beneficial owner of AIDC Ltd, are not unnecessarily constrained and ensure that an effective power of veto is not provided to third party interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In progressing this asset sale, in common with other recent asset sales, it is important for the Commonwealth to protect its financial interest and ensure that it receives full value from the sale. For this reason, the bill makes the necessary provisions to protect the sale from the imposition of stamp duty and cancels any residual franking credits that may exist in the company at the time of the sale. The approach to these provisions is consistent with 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2570"> provisions in other sale legislation which this House has previously passed. Similarly&mdash;and I note a number of speakers on the other side commented on this&mdash;employee interests have been protected by the provisions relating to long service leave and occupational health and safety. In other words, all the benefits that have currently accrued to the employees of AIDC Ltd will be protected through this legislation and will be passed on in appropriate circumstances to those employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With a maturing financial and merchant banking industry in Australia, it is important that the government progress this sale and thereby remove itself from this area of business activity. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">We foreshadowed these amendments in the second reading debate because of our specific concern about what happens to the Australian Submarine Corporation shares. We believe that the Submarine Corporation and the arrangements that the Labor government developed in relation to it&mdash;its strategic partnership with Kockums, its involvement and establishment in Adelaide and the huge 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> growth in industry development that occurred consequent upon that&mdash;are a shining example of what can sensibly be done if the leverage of government policy together with the financing that backed it from the AIDC can be brought together.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe there is still some potential future to build off the success of the Submarine Corporation. It is for that reason that we would obviously be reluctant to see the Submarine Corporation sold off as part of the arrangement that will sell off AIDC, the share package that the AIDC holds in the Submarine Corporation. That being said, we note that it is the intention of the government, in abolishing AIDC Ltd by the legislation, to still keep the corporation within AIDC ostensibly to manage the loans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are saying that, in addition to the management of the loans, the corporation should hold the Submarine Corporation shares. We think it is important not just for the strategic national interest that Australia control its own defence capability but that there be future opportunities for the development of a defence based industry in this country, and the ability to develop that clearly is going to be significantly limited if the government still is not in the game. Our approach is to keep the government in the game, not by taking the shares back but by recognising where they are held and by parking the management of those within the AIDC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also would require there to be some bipartisan discussion as to what the government's future intentions may be in relation to the shareholding of Submarine Corporation. We believe we can inject some sensible input and hope that the government might be prepared to embrace us in that approach in trying to develop a strengthened industry off our defence capability, off our shipbuilding industry, off our heavy engineering capacity, but really moving more into the strategic development, the high-tech industries, associated with defence and sense tracking, and recognising the significance that that has, quite frankly, for the manufacturing industry. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2572">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you think of the manufacturing industry generally, it is the software packages and the engineering dimensions that are important. It is not just a question of the physical infrastructure; it is the processes by which that technology is run. It is the systems running; it is the information technology. If Australia is to continue its growth in manufacturing exports, and that growth has already been significant, we need to use strategic inputs and strategic placements and the government needs to be in there as a partner with industry in securing a future direction for this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We therefore think that this amendment ought to be supported by the government. It is still saying that it can look to deal with it as it would like but that there would be a requirement to have wider discussions as to what its intentions might be. We accept the assurance of the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) that it is not intended to sell the Submarine Corporation into foreign interests, but we are seeking to secure the base in this country for the Submarine Corporation and that which flows from it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also support these amendments to the AIDC Sale Bill. In my speech in the second reading debate I made a couple of comments about what had happened in terms of answers to questions in the Senate. In the answers I quoted from the Senate committee hearing, the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp), who was representing the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore), made it perfectly clear after questions from Senator Ray that it was not the intention of the government to sell the Australian Submarine Corporation to foreign interests. But, after a series of questions, it came out that the government and the minister have not put forward any proposal as to how that is to be avoided when the AIDC is sold. We do not know what is going to happen. I hope the minister is going to tell us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is actually going to happen to the Australian Submarine Corporation? How is the minister going to ensure that that does not happen in the general context of the sale of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> AIDC Ltd? Interestingly, when asked what the options are, the top official said the government had made no determination. Even though the government have said on the one hand that they want to retain the 100 per cent&mdash;and they have brought the bill forward, they are saying they are selling the AIDC Ltd&mdash;they have not made a determination on this key aspect of the future of the Australian Submarine Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given that situation, when asked, the official said, `Well, one option is to actually do what this amendment proposes', which is to hold the shares in the AIDC. So that is one option, and this is an option which we are urging in terms of these amendments. So we would urge the government to accept this amendment. They have been properly structured and their implications have been looked at. We urge the government to accept these amendments, to accept this approach, and let us give at least some security to the Australian Submarine Corporation in terms of its Australian ownership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the shadow minister said, as we move into further discussions on the future of Defence Industries, we can then have that body in that place at least for the time being until we determine some further important issues in relation to Defence Industries. I also think that we should have some kind of broad discussion in this parliament on the future of Defence Industries and what is to happen after the AIDC is sold.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have supported the AIDC Ltd sale, but we are saying to the minister, `Look after the Australian Submarine Corporation. Let us clearly state what the intention of the government is, and let us adopt these amendments.'</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Submarine Corporation is particularly important to the Australian government and to the Australian people&mdash;both because of its importance to Australian defence and because of its importance to Australian industry. The government's significant holding in the Submarine Corporation via the AIDC is not something that should be allowed to go through with the passage of this bill without clear views being expressed by the parliament on that important matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2573">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is appropriate that the parliament place some restrictions upon the sale of the AIDC to ensure that the Submarine Corporation remains for the time being with a government stakeholding in it. The relevant amendment moved by the Manager of Opposition Business, the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean), clearly provides a mechanism through which that can occur to ensure that the Submarine Corporation's government shareholding is kept in the AIDC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That opens up a number of opportunities further down the track as part of the development of Australian defence industry policy, and indeed, more broadly, industry policy for other sectors, because defence industry so often is at the cutting edge of technology developments and where defence industry goes so too does the broader industry sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I quickly say a couple of words about the Submarine Corporation and its importance to defence. The Submarine Corporation has now managed to construct three submarines as part of an order of six, which are without doubt amongst the best in the world and regarded by many as being the most significant non&hyphen;nuclear submarines anywhere in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is a capability that is important to Australia's defence. It is a capability that the opposition take very seriously. Indeed, it is a capability that was established during the period in which Labor was in office, when Kim Beazley and later Robert Ray as ministers for defence strongly supported the acquisition of those submarines and supported the Australian government's involvement in that project to ensure that it came to fruition and to ensure that there was a substantial Australian participation in the management of the organisation. I am not sure that that is a commitment that is shared by both sides of the parliament, and I would invite the minister at the table, the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey), to take the opportunity in this debate to make that clear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth noting that in terms of the commitment on this side of the parliament to the Submarine Corporation and the defence importance of that program, we have made it plain that were we in government we would 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> commit to the additional two submarines, 7 and 8. I invite the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan), who is in the chamber, to address that issue to see whether or not the government is serious about maintaining a significant defence capability in submarine development, maintenance and construction. It is important to the Labor Party. It was important to us in government and it remains important to us in opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the defence industry implications of the Submarine Corporation, it is not just that the Submarine Corporation has produced an absolute world leader in submarine warfare; it is the long line of domestic companies who supply to the Submarine Corporation who have also benefited. The downstream suppliers to the Submarine Corporation number in their thousands. Many of those are local firms who have been pulled along by the submarine program into high&hyphen;tech areas and, as a result of that, are now competing successfully in world markets for the various components provision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is an important consideration in the long&hyphen;term sustainability, not just of the Collins class submarine but in terms of the development of new classes of warships and other platforms. That is a capability we should not see let go. It is important that in dealing with the sale of the AIDC the parliament places these strictures on the sale. The parliament should ensure through this particular amendment that the shareholding in the Submarine Corporation remains for the time being with the government, that it is parked in the AIDC. It is a very sensible and worthwhile amendment, and I do hope the government accepts it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have noted the contributions that have been made in respect of these amendments by the members opposite. As I indicated in the second reading debate, the government does not propose to sell the Australian Submarine Corporation with the AIDC Ltd. Therefore, these amendments are unnecessary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the opposition seeks to do through these amendments, as has been made very clear by the members opposite, is to place as 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2574"> many restrictions as is possible on what future flexibility there may be for government in dealing with a 48.5 per cent shareholding in the Australian Submarine Corporation. And that is the reality of it&mdash;there is a 48.5 per cent shareholding by AIDC in the Australian Submarine Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that we have indicated there is no intention to dispose of that shareholding with the sale of AIDC Ltd, the government reserves its flexibility and the legislation provides for where it puts that shareholding in the foreseeable future. By this amendment it is suggested that it should be put in the corporation. The Labor Party is saying that the government must place this shareholding in AIDC Ltd.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Well, the government could place that shareholding in the defence portfolio, and I wonder what the objections to that might be from the members opposite. It could place it in the industry portfolio because, from the contributions of the members opposite, the debate centres around the industry that is associated with the Australian Submarine Corporation. It could place the ASC in an Australian company&mdash;a company approved by the Department of Defence and approved by Kockums who has a shareholding in the Australian Submarine Corporation as well. Or it could place the ASC in that most appropriate department for protecting the assets of government&mdash;the Department of Finance. It could be placed in any of those portfolios to the point where the shareholding continues in government ownership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what we really have to look at here is not restricting it. We have to look at the fact that this Submarine Corporation is involved in the construction of submarines. In July of last year, the first Collins class submarine was launched. There are five more that are being constructed under contract over the next several years, and that is not going to change. That is going to be there for the defence capability of Australia. As each one comes off, gets into the water and becomes operational, that enhances the defence capability of Australia. That is not at risk in terms of the shareholding by AIDC Ltd in the Australian Submarine Corporation.</PARA>

That advice will be forthcoming as and when there is a need to do something further with it. The shareholding will not be sold. That undertaken is given. Legislation is not required.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first thing was that the shadow minister, the member for Hotham (Mr Crean), said that there needed to be a bipartisan discussion. I am not sure there was too much of a bipartisan discussion when this whole matter arose back in the 1980s. It occurs to me that, when you count the numbers around here, the government ought to be running these things and ought to be making the decisions. That is what the government will do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Let me also respond to the assertion that, somehow or other, this government will leave the Australian Submarine Corporation open to foreign takeovers. Well, it won't. But, secondly, it is worth while remembering that the shareholder agreement and the articles of association effectively give protection to either the AIDC shareholding in ASC or Kockums, the Swedes. The agreement and the articles of association give them pre-emptive rights to make sure that nobody comes in as a shareholder they do not approve of. We have no problem with the Swedes; they have done a very good job; but they are a foreigner.</PARA>

I could not agree more. There is a rationalisation of those sorts of industries going on all round the world, and you would not expect that this country should or could escape it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shadow minister for defence, the member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis), always raises this subject so I may as well respond&mdash;submarine seven and eight. Put your hand up for seven, eight, nine, ten, 11 and 12. The fact is that you did not have the courage to make that decision before the last election but then suddenly with the luxury of opposition, almost in the first few weeks, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) wants to build seven or eight. Let me tell you that a lot of people on my side of the parliament would love to build seven, eight, nine, ten and so on&mdash;the problem is getting the priorities right and, secondly, making sure that the submarines we have got are working well.</PARA>

We have been told by both the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) and the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan) that it is not their intention to sell the AIDC holding in the Australian Submarine Corporation. They justify their opposition to our amendment by saying it is unnecessary. They haven't actually said there is anything wrong with it. They haven't disputed the course of action we propose.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this grievance debate to express my concerns about the needs of older people in our community with disabilities and their older carers. My remarks will be based on a study carried out on behalf of the Mullauna Retirement Village at Blacktown run by the Uniting Church. I propose to quote at length from this report as the findings must surely be mirrored across Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mullauna is seeking to extend its services to older people with disabilities and older people caring for people with disabilities both in the provision of accommodation and in home support. The Mullauna group believe they should be extending their services based on community needs in the following areas: both residential and in&hyphen;home; as part of a continuum of care; with consideration for affordability; with adequately skilled respite carers; with consideration for the needs of older non&hyphen;English speaking people and Aboriginal people; in more innovative forms, for example, accommodation for both carers and the person receiving care; and to develop its expertise to cater for older people with sensory disabilities and dementia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The results of the report I am using today would surely apply equally to many other parts of Australia. The Blacktown local government area could be described as a financially constrained area based on the evidence of the relatively high proportion of people living in public housing. This group represents 14.9 per cent of the Blacktown population, which is well above the state average of 5.6 per cent. There is also a relatively high proportion of older people on very low income support. This low income support would be an impeding factor in obtaining assistance from community and privately based services for domestic and personal care support. The report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Blacktown has a relatively high proportion of residents (33.6%), 65 years and over, who were born in a non&hyphen;English speaking country (NESC). Blacktown is the 4th highest LGA in the state regarding residents, 65 years and over from NES countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Western Sydney Area Health Service, in a study of older people in western Sydney from NES 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2577"> countries, stated that it is estimated that in five years time, 25% of all older people in Australia will be from a NESC.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In Blacktown there are seven retirement villages comprising self&hyphen;care and hostel units. There are 10 nursing homes. In total there are 17 establishments which have either self-care, hostel or nursing home places or a combination of these forms of accommodation. The Department of Community Services manages four group homes for people with intellectual disabilities and funds a further 13 homes managed by community or church organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This group home accommodation mainly caters for a younger population. In total there are fewer than 10 people over 60 in these homes. A coordinator of a number of these group homes stated that these older residents often suffer from early forms of dementia. As a result they are not able to manage in the group homes because of staffing numbers. The report went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The extent of community outreach services by retirement villages in Blacktown was not investigated, except to note that Mullauna manages 30 community aged care packages. It is known that some of the community and church managed group homes provide support to assist people with intellectual disability living alone or with carers in the Blacktown area.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Accommodation is sought in mainstream hostels and nursing homes. Service providers say that it is very difficult to find such hostels or nursing home placements. They are often forced to seek placements out of Blacktown.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a strong demand for respite accommodation. The resultant waiting list for planned respite means that there is little opportunity for emergency residential care. Also, people with disabilities often have complex care needs that cannot be met in available respite facilities, thereby increasing the concerns of carers of these people. This very important report I am quoting from went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While nursing homes and hostels may be inappropriate forms of accommodation for people under 65 years with disabilities, they have often been the only forms of respite for carers of people with disabilities. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Carers support groups report that in recent times even these `inappropriate' forms of respite are becoming less available, even though there have not been any changes to legislation or departmental policy in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This report indicates that there is still a significant number of older people with disabilities or handicaps in Blacktown who are managing to assist each other or are being assisted by some family member without any outside help.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The older Aboriginal people's needs in this area have never been addressed; they are unique because the elders are much revered. Supply the hostel with the appropriate skilled staff and the families will do the rest. They also have a significantly shorter life span than other groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Non&hyphen;English speaking older persons have special needs with dementia in any form that sets in. The first, of course, is language. Therefore the need for hostel and nursing home care in their mother tongue is absolutely essential.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Stroke victims are also there in very high proportions, another horror for the victim and the carers. Stroke debilitates different sections of the brain. Persons who lose the power of speech can be locked into a world we dare not envisage. Then others lose use of limbs and cannot feed themselves or control their bodily functions. Carers are usually the partner until either the carer burns out or ceases physically to be able to perform the needs of the victim.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The conclusion in the report is that there is considerable scope to extend services to support older people with disabilities, especially older carers. The report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The potential for expansion of residential services in Blacktown is virtually non-existent. It seems very unlikely that the Commonwealth government (which administers and funds hostel, nursing homes and community aged care package programs) will extend these forms of care in Blacktown.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In the report, service providers pinpoint the greatest area of unmet service needs for older people with disabilities and older carers as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> respite care, both regular and emergency, both in residential care and at home;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> community transport, more extensive and more appropriate;  
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2578">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> assistance to overcome housebound isolation for both those with disabilities and carers. This isolation was also linked to associated needs of more information on available services and the provision of training for carers; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> more networking of services to promote complementarity and flexibility of service provision.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Finally, the Mullauna report indicates that more than 50 per cent of the older population of Blacktown with its multicultural character has some disability. Service providers in Blacktown indicate that there are some urgent unmet needs for older people with disabilities and older carers in the area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By far the greatest need was for more respite services both in residential care and in-home respite. The demand for respite is constantly increasing, leading to long waiting lists and diminishing opportunities for emergency respite. Further needs include more flexible and more extensive community transport, the alleviation of housebound social isolation and the development of better networking of residential and community based services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope that this report on the needs of older people with disabilities and older carers will lead to improved services for those most deserving people, and I compliment the Mullauna village on their important work. I would be happy to table the report for the information of all honourable members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will conclude by referring to a statement by Ellen Long, who is the secretary of the National Seniors Association at Blacktown&mdash;this being Seniors Week in New South Wales&mdash;and let her have the last say on this issue. I have asked Ellen Long to make some submission to me relating to this particular matter, and I will read her short comments:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Group homes in Blacktown LGA&mdash;there are many. Most of these homes have intellectually impaired persons, some have one or several disabilities. Most of these houses have three to five residents, one only has ten. The problems applying to these are many and complex . . .

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this grievance debate today to speak to the House about one of the most tragic and distressing problems facing our community; that is, the abuse and neglect of children. We are all aware of the extensive media coverage recently of the sexual abuse of children by paedophiles. This is obviously a serious problem in our society. However, today I want to speak about the abuse and neglect of children by their families, because the most common child abuse offenders&mdash;both sexual and non&hyphen; sexual&mdash;are family members.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, a national study by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare showed that natural parents were responsible in more than two-thirds of abuse and neglect cases. Yet the fact that abusive and neglectful behaviour towards children most often occurs at the hands of family members, usually in the home, by no means makes it a private matter. Rather, the abuse and neglect of our children is very much a public issue&mdash;one that has tremendous social and economic consequences for our society.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2579">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The magnitude of this problem is impossible to illustrate with hard statistics; thus the real incidence of child abuse and neglect is unknown. However, in 1995, the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare reported that, based on substantiated cases, the annual rate of child abuse in Australia is 5.7 per 1,000 children. The national committee on violence has reported that the age group at greatest risk of violent death in Australia is infants up to 12 months of age. In addition, the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare study showed that, based on substantiated cases, the age group with the greatest incidence of abuse and neglect were 13&hyphen; and 14&hyphen;year olds. Furthermore, although female children represent three&hyphen;quarters of substantiated sex abuse cases, both sexes are equally at risk of abuse and neglect. No-one knows for sure whether the incidence of child abuse and neglect is growing, but many law enforcement officials, social workers and members of the clergy who deal with this problem on a daily basis are of the opinion that it is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What sort of factors put a child at risk of abuse or neglect?  While it is true that child abuse affects individuals representing all socioeconomic levels, most research suggests that it is the stresses caused by poverty, unemployment, under&hyphen;employment and social isolation. A child is also at risk if his or her parents suffered abuse or neglect as children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The abuse and neglect of our children entail tremendous social, personal and economic costs in our community. The long-term impact on abused children is grave. These children grow up to have poor self-esteem. They grow up unable to trust others. They often grow up not knowing how to deal with conflict other than through aggressive means, thus setting up a cycle of chronic abuse. Indeed, it is an unfortunate fact that in the area of child abuse violence begets violence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although the majority of abused and neglected children do not become delinquent, criminal or violent, studies have shown that being abused or neglected as a child significantly increases that child's risk for delinquency, adult criminal behaviour and violent criminal behaviour. Research based on large surveys overseas suggests that severely abused 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> children are two to three times more likely to have higher rates of academic and disciplinary problems in school, physically violent behaviour at home and outside the home and, of course, substance abuse. Victims of severe child abuse are four times more likely to be arrested.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tremendous economic costs to federal, state and local governments associated with the abuse and neglect of children include costs of medical treatment, family law services, social security, education and law enforcement. Furthermore, overseas research suggests that arrest and imprisonment by law enforcement officials often does little to deter offenders, particularly amongst those groups that are already highly marginalised in our society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given these distressing and costly consequences of child abuse, I have a major concern that the way in which we are dealing with this problem is seriously flawed. What I mean to say is that way too often we depend on social workers, police officers, lawyers, judges and health care workers to pick up the pieces after irreparable damage has been done. Surely we have an obligation to do all that we can to facilitate the prevention of and early intervention into the abuse and neglect of our children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this regard, we could learn from some of the community service groups in Australia who are preventing child abuse and neglect by offering supportive services to at risk families. In New South Wales, the real pioneer group in this area is the Child Abuse Prevention Service, known as CAPS. CAPS commenced operating its 24-hour crisis and support line in 1973, three year before the New South Wales Department of Community Services introduced its crisis telephone service. Since that time, CAPS trained counsellors&mdash;the majority of whom work without pay&mdash;have provided this service 24 hours a day, 365 days year. Remarkably, CAPS has not been off the air, so to speak, since its inception.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to its hotline service, CAPS has six drop-in facilities&mdash;at Wyong, Orange, Ashfield, Liverpool, Umina and Tuggerah&mdash;for stressed parents, primarily mothers. Ser 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2580"> vices provided at these facilities are aimed at the management of stress, resolving conflict in non-violent ways and promoting attitudes and behaviours which nurture and support children through, among other things, discussion groups, nutrition classes and workshops aimed at boosting self-esteem. CAPS trained counsellors also frequently make home visits to at risk families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not an overstatement to say that CAPS has saved the lives of countless children in New South Wales since it commenced operations in 1973. What is truly remarkable is the degree to which CAPS provides these services in spite of<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> extremely limited funds. Other than around a $100,000 annual grant from the Commonwealth government, CAPS relies totally on private donations and the efforts of numerous unpaid staff. CAPS receives not one cent from the New South Wales state government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">CAPS and similar community sector organisations play a crucial role in the prevention of child abuse and neglect. At this time, I want to acknowledge the contributions of the Children at Risk Committee, which has since 1980 provided a significant community education program in my electorate. We cannot, however, depend too heavily on these organisations. CAPS, the Children at Risk Committee and similar organisations are seriously underfunded by governments at local, state and federal levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe we all have a responsibility and a moral obligation to do more to prevent child abuse and neglect. As law&hyphen;makers in this House, we must ensure that a deaf ear is no longer turned towards the cries and screams of Australia's generations of abused and neglected children.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to pursue the issue of the dumping of aviation fuel over the residents of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Grayndler and Lowe. It is something I raised in the House two days ago, but as yet we still have not seen a response from the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) or the member for Lowe (Mr Zammit) or in fact from anyone on the other side of the House. I did think that the chair of the Sydney Airport Community Forum might have taken the opportunity today to raise it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The situation on 15 October 1996 where an Evergreen Airlines flight left Mascot airport at approximately 12.59 p.m. and sprayed raw avgas over the residents of Grayndler and Lowe&mdash;in fact, from the end of the runway right up to Russell Lea, which is near Drummoyne, a distance of 10 kilometres&mdash;required, indeed demanded, an immediate response from the minister to show that the residents of the inner western suburbs of Sydney could be confident that some action would be taken to ensure that this did not happen again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I raised the issue yesterday in a meeting of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Communications, Transport and Microeconomic Reform with the head of Airservices Australia. I was assured by Airservices Australia that they will get back to me with a plan to ensure that these occurrences do not happen again. I would have also thought that we needed an urgent political response from the government to ensure that this does not happen again, because the response I received from the minister to question on notice No. 927, I think, is clearly inadequate. It is clearly inadequate to simply say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) Should any future incidents occur, the issue will again be raised with the operator as a matter of urgency.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That someone will pick up the phone and ask the operator to explain their actions is appalling and is really a tickle and slap approach to a very real problem which has the potential to be a health and environmental catastrophe. So today in this House I am raising again the fact that we do not really have a response from the minister on this, and I call upon the government to implement a program of real action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister's response indicated that there were three similar alleged incidents in the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2581"> previous 12 months. I read on page 3 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on Wednesday, 19 March 1997 that those incidents occurred on 30 July, 13 August and 14 January and involved Evergreen Airlines once again. It is a pity, I must say, that the minister gave a response to a question on notice of some five months standing to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> and not to the parliament before the residents of the inner western suburbs of Sydney were given an answer as to what had occurred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been massive concern since I raised this issue in parliament. I spoke yesterday on radio 2BL, 2GB, Today FM and Triple M. Residents throughout Sydney were calling talkback radio yesterday, telling their stories about oil and petrol fumes being dumped on their schools, their homes, their children, their parks and their clothes and about the black filter of soot they have to wipe off their cars in the morning at places such as Sydenham and Marrickville in my electorate. Unfortunately, we still have not seen a government response.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If it is the case that Evergreen Airlines have committed these serious offences&mdash;four times at least over a 12-month period&mdash;then I think there is a case to say that Australia does not want them. The Australian aviation industry deserves better than to put up with shonky US airlines. US registered airlines have an appalling record on safety and on their mechanical administrative operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is now up to the government to say, `Enough is enough: repeat offenders will be told they are not welcome in Australia.' For any offence, as a minimum there should be action to bring in very severe penalties which will ensure that there is action on the lackadaisical attitude of these airlines&mdash;in this case where five broken fuel valves were spraying fuel all over residents of my electorate and the electorate of Lowe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been very disappointed with the lack of response from the government on this issue. We see a lack of response on the fuel dumping. We see residents of my electorate in weatherboard houses which cannot be insulated who are still waiting for a response as to what will happen to their homes&mdash; 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">whether they will be voluntarily acquired or what the government will do now that it has acknowledged that those houses cannot be insulated properly. In just the same way, the people in small businesses in Sydenham who have had to shut up shop and have had their livelihoods taken away are still waiting for a response from the government. Whether that response is positive or negative, it is not good enough to leave them hanging for months and years before there is action. When it is an issue of the millionaire aviator mates of the government, such as Dick Smith, then we see action. But when it is an issue of the health and safety of residents in inner western Sydney we see nothing. We do not see trials of weatherboard housing insulation or of fuel dumping or any of these issues in the ministerial entrance such as we saw with the PAD system. I am very disappointed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased that the member for Lowe (Mr Zammit) is in the chamber, because I hope that he will respond with his concern about fuel being dumped on his residents. As yet the member for Lowe has not participated in the aviation debate, because he had a function&mdash;and I understand that&mdash;for the member for Braddon (Mr Miles), the leader of the ultraconservative Lyons Forum, who is obviously a very important colleague to him. But, frankly, I would have thought last night when the member for Lowe attempted to attack me and the member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay) in an adjournment speech&mdash;it was a bit like being hit with a wet lettuce and we are still waiting for any issue of substance to be raised&mdash;he might have mentioned the fact that aviation fuel was dumped on his residents for about four kilometres. I would have thought there might have been one word expressing concern about that in the speech. But, if you look at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> for Wednesday, 19 March 1997, you will see no mention of aviation fuel nor of Evergreen Airlines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the substance of this debate. This is an important debate which requires action from those on both sides of the House who are fair dinkum about representing their electorate. I hope the member for Lowe has something to say about this issue and makes representations to his government to make 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2582"> sure that his minister pulls his finger out and shows he is fair dinkum about preventing further incidents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have seen is a trigger. We have anecdotal evidence raised by residents around Sydney airport being taken up now in this House. Not only should action and penalties&mdash;and if needs be the banning of airlines&mdash;be brought in but there should be regular reporting to the Sydney Airport Community Forum of these incidents. Whenever this occurs, you should not have to put a question on notice and wait five months to get details about it. Nor should you have to get a response which just says, `Three similar alleged incidents have occurred,' with no details whatsoever. The residents around Sydney airport have a right to know when carcinogens are being dumped on their heads. They have a right to know, and they have a right to be informed by the minister. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="2582"><TITLE>Self&hyphen;Funded Retirees</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I want to draw members' attention to a very unrepresented section of the community, the self&hyphen;funded retirees. This group of elderly Australians amounts to about six to seven per cent of the population. They are about a million people, so I am not talking about a small group but a significant one, living not only in my electorate but all over Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The growth in the number of Australians in the over&hyphen;65 bracket dictates that some drastic measures have to be taken if the Commonwealth aged pension is to be retained as a safety net for those unable to provide for their own retirement. With living conditions in Australia some of the best in the world, with excellent nutrition and with skilled medical facilities, elderly people's life expectancy is getting longer. People in good health can function quite efficiently into their mid&hyphen;80s, and a fair proportion will live to be 90 plus. This means that, with a conventional retiring age of 65, people will live in retirement for an average of 20 years. This is a quite significant lifespan at a time when you are no longer getting regular earnings from work.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From talking to groups of self&hyphen;funded retirees in my electorate, it is painfully obvious that these people feel overlooked and neglected by successive governments. I submit that the time has come to take positive action to attend to these people's needs. I again draw members' attention to the fact that over six per cent of the voting public can easily change a government and one million discontented elderly Australians can be ignored at our peril.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Self&hyphen;funded retirees are a special group. They are independent and self&hyphen;sufficient. They do not participate in the welfare system, they are not a burden on the public purse and they are a group of people who have always paid their taxes, abided by the law, conformed to government regulations and generally contributed in their working lifetime to the good of society. In many cases, I am sure they have given much of their personal time&mdash;and maybe even their money&mdash;to their local community, welfare and political organisations. I believe they should be given a fair go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Consider some other aspects of this group of a million elderly Australians. In America they are known as the `grey lobby'&mdash;an apt and evocative title. Their investments represent a major proportion of national savings. These investments are a major source of funds for national development and, I would like to emphasise again, save the taxpayer many millions of dollars because their investors do not take DSS payments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, you may find that self&hyphen;funded retirees have helped their families during times of major unemployment. They often assist with education of grandchildren. They support the Treasury in the payment of their taxes. They do much voluntary work for senior citizens' groups and community groups, such as Meals on Wheels. Also, most have retained private health insurance and, therefore, relieve the strain on the public hospital service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was approached recently by a branch in my electorate of the Association of Independent Retirees and had the privilege of addressing a meeting at which more than 70 people attended. I have since had the opportunity of discussing with the president, Mr Bob 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2583"> Sedgewick, and the vice&hyphen;president, Mr Bill Turner, a number of their concerns of which I seek to inform the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The crux of the self-funded retirees' problem lies in the fact that governments in the past have not granted this group any status. There is no classification for self&hyphen;funded retirees in the government's census form. Can you imagine that we actually have today, in the last stages of the 20th century, a million elderly Australians without classification, unrecognised in law and unprotected in attempting to maintain the lifestyle they have worked so hard to achieve? The first thing we must do for this group is put them on the next and subsequent census.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These Australians see themselves as a great asset to our nation. They ask for recognition of the following basic objectives: tax relief for pharmaceutical expenses, inflation protection for investments, such as tax&hyphen;free bonds; tax deductibility for private health insurance; simplification of criteria for the seniors card and for the card to be made national so that it is accepted by all states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now would also draw the attention of the House to a risk factor involved for self-funded retirees. Unlike those who live off the state, who receive a regular fortnightly payment which is indexed for inflation, self-funded retirees have no mechanism open to them but to invest in income producing marketable securities. Fixed interest securities are subject to variable interest rates and ordinary shares are subject to market movements, the profitability of the company and the generosity of the directors. Self-funded retirees do not have the security of a defined income or of cost of living adjustments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the taxation area these people are taxed as if they are still working. Only those with incomes under $20,000 have recently received a tax rebate equivalent to that available to pensioners. Furthermore, they have concerns that the current policy is gradually destroying one of our greatest resources&mdash;it is not encouraging current wage earners to save for their retirement. The follow&hyphen;on from this is the attitude of the younger generation to saving. They are often heard to say, `What's 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the use of saving? We will be better off on the pension.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is painfully obvious that these one million elderly Australians need attention. They need a member of the government through whom their requests and suggestions can be funnelled. I suggest to the House that a minister be appointed to look after the interests of self-funded retirees. Obviously, with such a large group of people, their problems will spill over to many departments. Therefore, the appointment of a minister to intervene for them, to coordinate all their needs and requests is warranted. Furthermore, an appointment of a minister would be recognition of their status in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said earlier in this speech, the self-funded retirees have nowhere to go, no-one to represent their cause or interests. Mr Deputy Speaker, consider the Aboriginal people who number around 300,000 and have a full-time minister, consider the pensioners who have the Minister for Social Security; but self-funded retirees, who number one million, have no minister, no representative, no-one to talk to and nowhere to go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This group of elderly Australians have never had recognition, yet they are deserving of as much recognition as pensioners, veterans, Aboriginals, migrants, sportsmen, sportswomen, small business, defence personnel, and families, all of whom are recognised and have ministerial representation. These Australians are not a burden to the community; they are not a burden on the welfare system; they are not wealthy&mdash;and the longer they live the poorer they get.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I shall end by drawing the attention of the House to the fact that one million voters can easily swing an election, and it would be calamitous if they were turned into an electoral burden. Action to help self-funded retirees in a meaningful, ongoing way should be taken and should be taken now.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="2583"><TITLE>Research and Development: Intellectual Property</TITLE>

The last 12 months have seen regular exposes in the media which suggest that Australia will not be able to maintain its claim of being a clever country if we do not start to take seriously the issues of research and development and of intellectual property.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first year of the coalition government has been an interesting one indeed. On the one hand, we have a government led by the departments of Finance and Treasury that have savaged industry assistance programs, most notably the R&amp;D program, on the grounds that they are not cost effective. On the other, we have industry experts like Mr Jon Stanford, the former Director of the Bureau of Industry Economics, observing:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Knowledge is a key factor in underpinning faster growth. Knowledge&hyphen;intensive industries generate substantial spin-offs to other activities by their contribution to economic growth.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is high time that we acknowledge our overreliance on extractive industries&mdash;industries that have performed well in the past but which are neither sustainable in the long term nor able to keep pace with the industry of knowledge. As one visiting academic to Australia observed last year, `The only way to create wealth is through raw technology and the people who deliver it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia has proven itself to be world class in the mining industry, but only after the investment of huge sums of time and of money. Why are we not prepared to take the same level of risk with intellectual property? Putting knowledge back into technology should be a priority for any Australian government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my contribution to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) debate, I referred to one example of Australia's blase attitude towards the protection of intellectual property and research rights. In September last, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> reported on a team at the Sydney Children's Hospital Cancer Institute and its cutting edge experimentation into 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the treatment of cancer and the AIDS virus. If research such as this were to develop from pure experimentation into a marketable drug, the spill&hyphen;over effect it could have in Australia, in both human and economic terms, cannot be overstated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regrettably, the main gist of the article was to note that several key scientists producing this research had opted to relocate and continue their studies in Canada because of the unfavourable research and development environment in Australia. In short, it will be Canada and not Australia that will reap the rewards of years of painstaking research if the drug is marketed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Less than six months later a similar story hit the papers. Headlines such as `Flu pill trials leave us in the cold' and `Giants in battle for flu cure' dominated the front pages of the national press. A story frighteningly similar to the one I have just mentioned emerged. A United States drugs company revealed that an anti-influenza pill, which was described as `the drug that could be the most profitable in history' was in its final stages of testing. It was also noted that this wonder drug was the product of years of research by a team of Australian scientists at the Australian National University. This was a team of scientists who managed to obtain foreign funding for its research but who were rejected by the Hawke government when it applied for a research grant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because of successive Australian governments' lax attitude towards patents on intellectual property, an English pharmaceutical company now stands to become the world's biggest drug company early in the next decade. Dr Graeme Laver, an Australian scientist involved in the initial investigation of this influenza drug, noted that this was yet another instance of local scientists moving overseas to further world&hyphen;class research&mdash;and all because of a lack of funding for research and development and inadequate protection of patents in Australia. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If it&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">the flu pill&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">which is a pity because the whole thing started in Australia and Australia should profit from it.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What a pity indeed.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Australia is already overreliant on imported drugs. If this does not change, our ageing population will see this dependence further burden our ailing current account balance sheet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">World Competitiveness Yearbook</EMPHASIS> showed a substantial drop in Australia's international competitiveness. Overall we rated No. 21&mdash;a drop of five places on the previous 12 months, and the largest drop of any OECD nation. Of particular concern was our lack of competitiveness in the areas of entrepreneurship and innovation. Not surprisingly, our shabby performance in these fields meant that we also scored poorly in our ability to promote exports and enterprise overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australian research and development companies have struggled to secure adequate support for as long as R&amp;D has featured in the Australian vocabulary. As a result there has been an imbalance between the amount of time, talent and money that has gone into new R&amp;D compared with the successful marketing of new technology. But that is only part of the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's minimalist approach to the protection of intellectual property has meant that Australia has continued to fall behind our Asian and OECD counterparts. As Mr Tom Forgan, the founder of Australian Technology Park, observed in an interview with the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> last July:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The question is, if the government puts $4.5 billion into research and development each year, what have we got to show for it?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No one is actually making any products&mdash;it's a waste of time and money. We're selling the technology for nothing and we can't afford to keep funding research that we lose the benefit of.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">While most overseas nations recognise and protect patents on pharmaceutical products for up to 15 years, Australia has lagged way behind. We are yet to hear whether the coalition government plans to bring our `intellectual property regime' into line with current international standards.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been argued that Australia wants stability in an increasingly chaotic world. As a result venture capital, a key ingredient of the success of American research and development, is missing in Australia. Australian governments and capital markets have been reluctant to take the necessary gamble when it comes to most R&amp;D projects. In those cases where the risk has been taken and the research successfully marketed, insufficient property rights have seen Australian firms lose their patents to aggressive overseas players.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The key to success for technology firms is the getting of, and the marketing of, information speedily. But the protection of intellectual property is equally as important. Without the protection of property rights, companies do not have the time to reap the rewards of their research and development before the patent term lapses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why would any Australian business be interested in funding R&amp;D in Australia under those terms? The earlier mentioned examples of companies researching cures for cancer and the flu show that they do not. They merely move offshore. The current government has to start looking at the bigger picture. It must review its policies towards research and development and patents immediately, otherwise it is probable that Australia will feature even more poorly in this year's world competitiveness year book.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="2585"><TITLE>Automotive Industry: Tariffs</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to say a few words in support of a vital Australian industry that has under trying conditions served its sentence, rehabilitated itself, improved and re-educated itself, but is sadly still under threat of yet further punishment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If Australia's car manufacturers drew up Christmas wish lists last year, those lists certainly would not have included the majority draft report of the Industry Commission on the automotive industry. The majority report recommended an annual reduction in tariffs of 2.5 per cent after the 15 per cent level is achieved in the year 2000, thereby reducing them to 5 per cent in 2005. The dissenting opinion written by associate commissioner Ian 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2586"> Webber calls for tariffs to remain steady at 15 per cent until 2005 and a further reassessment down the road before deciding on arrangements post-2005.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of the two conflicting recommendations, the latter is eminently the more palatable choice for my state of South Australia and also for Victoria which are home to the bulk of the car assembly and ancillary industries. In 1988 the tariff on imported vehicles was 45 per cent. It is now down to 22.5 per cent and by the turn of the century it will have been reduced to 15 per cent. The local industry has responded by becoming more efficient and more export oriented and directly employs over 45,000 people, representing 4 per cent of the nation's manufacturing work force and 17 per cent of South Australia's. In the broader sense, 3.5 per cent of the Australian work force relies on the automotive industry for employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In accepting the Button plan, car manufacturers were promised micro and macro economic reform as an offset to the tariff reductions. In the area of tax reform, the performance of federal and state governments has been disappointing, to say the least. For a number of years, business, labour, welfare organisations and politicians of all stripes have been calling on governments to alter the crippling tax structure and I cannot remember a state government coming to power without promising some form of tax reform. Yet all too often the reforms have not been forthcoming and the federal government gets the blame because it will not promise to deliver the shortfall to states' coffers. The time for buck-passing is long gone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition tried and failed to initiate tax reform at the 1993 federal election, but that failure says a lot more about the desirability of consensus than it does about the undesirability of tax reform. We know how difficult it is to achieve consensus when ambition of party holds sway over the national interest and commitment to necessary reform. Experience tells us it is far easier to divide the people than it is to unite them. Now that Paul Keating&mdash;who had all the divisive skills of Solomon, but none of the wisdom&mdash;has moved on, it is the time for 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> federal, state and local governments to sit down with business and labour to thrash out meaningful reform to Australia's tax base. The bandaid approach to taxation has failed us time and again. The system has become more complicated and open to abuse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Wholesale sales taxes and others such as FID and BAD&mdash;and what a superb acronym that is for an inappropriate tax&mdash;as well as income and company tax, should be reviewed with all of the possibilities put on the table for consideration. Let us finally look at ending payroll tax. It is incomprehensible to me how any government can justify Australian corporations paying taxes on the people they employ when lack of jobs is such a devastating national problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The federal government should realise that one of the most costly business inputs for car makers is tax. If the automotive industry is expected to compete in a less protected world, then it is up to the government to dramatically ease that adjustment by changing the current tax system. Without tax reform, lowering of tariffs will not be a means to an end, but become an end in itself. Taxes alone are not the only problem. Reforms are needed in many areas and I am pleased to see that the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) has set his sights on the wharves after achieving significant change in the labour market. Reforming the waterfront will certainly assist with exports, but a vibrant domestic market is the key prerequisite for a continued and expanded investment and presence of car manufacturers in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australians drive a fleet of vehicles older than that of most western nations. This may be due somewhat to our benign climate, but more so to the cost of our vehicles. Government must assist local manufacturers in bringing down those costs to make new cars more affordable. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry believes that full account should be taken of the economic, strategic and social impacts of any further tariff reductions. While they support the continuing removal of tariff barriers, they too argue that reductions be part of a wider reform package.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2587">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The improvement in efficiency and quality of the Australian product has resulted in a more outward looking industry. However, that pioneering spirit is in danger of being stymied by trade barriers that prevent maximising overseas sales. A level playing field in terms of trade is an admirable aim and international accords are leading every nation in that direction. But there are certainly no prizes for being the first nation to cross the finishing line and our haste to get there will hardly influence any other nation to follow suit as swiftly.</PARA>

As elected government representatives of those who will be most adversely affected by the adoption of the recommendations contained in the majority report, it is our responsibility to ensure that the government implements policy that will allow and encourage the future prosperity of this vital segment of Australian manufacturing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While we must of course wait on the commission for its final report, our constituents have not been as patient. They remind us every day of the dire consequences for the industry, for their jobs and for ours should the automotive industry go under. The coalition was elected on the promise of a better deal for regional areas and industries. There are few, if any, regional industries as important to both local and wider communities as our motor vehicle industry. South Australia under Labor suffered an exodus of manufacturing. Holden and Mitsubishi are still there and we must ensure they stay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The South Australian Centre for Economic Studies believes the Industry Commission erred badly in underestimating the importance of the car industry to South Australia. Contrary to the Industry Commission, the centre found that South Australia actually loses from tariff reductions. If tariffs are cut to 5 per cent, the centre calculates that there would be a reduction in my state's GSP of 0.18 percent. It might sound minuscule, but that translates to around $60 million and about 2,500 jobs. That is only the minimum case scenario. Incidentally, the centre is not recommending a halt to tariff cuts either, but merely pointing out the need for accompanying measures to adequately compensate for the tighter regime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now that we are making cars of which we can truly be proud, it would be tragically ironic if this vital industry were to disappear because of a blind commitment to dogma found in some text book.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In May last year the new government within weeks of taking office announced that, rather than proceed with the development of a second airport for Sydney at Badgerys Creek, it would also examine the possible location of the airport at Holsworthy. The Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) indicated that this was simply as a means of insurance because of the EIS process that was going ahead with respect to Badgerys Creek and that, in order to ensure that there would be a location for the new airport for Sydney, there needed to be a fall-back option.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Consequently the government decided to hold an EIS into the Holsworthy option as well. We were told time and time again by the minister and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) that nothing sinister had occurred. The government was simply making sure that it did not have all its eggs in one basket and that there was another option available to it with respect to the location of the airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the time the opposition indicated that its view was that the government's decision indicated very clearly that it intended to build Sydney's second airport at Holsworthy for a number of reasons: primarily because it would be cheaper, because the land involved was already Commonwealth owned whereas there was substantial land acquisition already occurring at Badgerys Creek; and because it was closer to existing substantial road and rail infrastructure. The fact that there are one or two marginal Liberal held seats around Badgerys Creek did not escape the opposition's notice either.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government kept insisting in spite of these suggestions that Holsworthy was simply a fall-back and that Badgerys Creek was the preferred location for the second airport for Sydney. As the days passed the true evidence of how crazy the suggestion of siting an airport at Holsworthy actually is started to emerge. Some things were obvious immedi 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ately. The fact that there is a vast amount of unexploded ordnance throughout the Holsworthy area as a result of its having been used as an army bombing range for a very long time was well known. The fact that much of terrain, particularly in the southern area, is full of very deep ravines that will make any form of construction of an airport extremely difficult was already well known. Then other facts began to emerge: the existence of many Aboriginal sacred sites in the area; a number of rare fauna species, endangered species and other things like a very substantial koala colony that would be threatened by the airport development; the existence of the Woronora Dam and catchment area immediately adjacent to the proposed airport site; the presence of the Lucas Heights nuclear reactor nearby; the fact that the proposed Olympic Games shooting range was at one end of where the airport would be located; the obvious presence of Defence facilities that would have to be relocated; the fact that Bankstown airport, the busiest airport in Australia, would almost certainly have to close down because of flight path complications; and other issues such as the fact that one of the world's premier hang gliding locations at Stanwell Tops would have to close because of flight path complications if the southern option for the Holsworthy airport was adopted. Of course, on top of all of these issues there is the very obvious impact on people living in the southern suburbs of Sydney immediately adjacent to the Holsworthy area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Throughout this fiasco Labor consistently stated its strong opposition to any airport being located at Holsworthy. Holsworthy is in effect the lungs of Sydney and has been very aptly described as the lungs of Sydney. When you look at the map of Sydney you will see this substantial green area sticking well into the main developed built&hyphen;up area of Sydney. That is Holsworthy and the opposition believes that that is how it should stay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Community reaction to the proposal has been unbelievable. I have spoken to numerous local groups, councils and representatives of councils. I have driven around the area. I have flown over the Holsworthy area in a helicop 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2589"> ter and received a vast number of letters from concerned residents in the Holsworthy region. I am sure that the government and the EIS process have received even more. I think it has gone well into the thousands. The honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) submitted a petition to the House several months ago and he almost needed a truck to carry it in because it was so large.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government deceit in this whole process has been absolutely monstrous. First the fact that within weeks of an election and after an election it indicated that it is considering building an airport at a site when it said absolutely nothing about this proposal prior to the election and won the seat of Hughes partly as a result. It is clear absolutely deceit. Secondly, people were buying land from the Defence Housing Authority within days of the government's announcement and asking the Defence Housing Authority and various other authorities, `Is there any truth in the rumour that an airport is going to be built here?' They were being told, `No', but when they then proceeded with their contracts they got the shock of their lives to discover that yes, the government was contemplating building an airport at Holsworthy. They were then told when they complained, `Sorry, we could not tell the Defence Housing Authority because that would have given it a commercial advantage against people it competes with in the housing market. Sorry, bad luck. The fact  that you have bought a piece of land that is going to be substantially devalued as a result of what we are doing is just by the by.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the weekend, an even more outrageous piece of deceit&mdash;and the final illustration of what this government has been on about&mdash;was uncovered. It was in a memo from an adviser to the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr McGauran) to the minister, in which he details a discussion he had with Mr Lachlan McComish, who is an adviser to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp). This discussion occurred in June last year. Yesterday, in the House, the minister for science confirmed the existence and authenticity of this document.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A couple of quotes from the document should suffice to illustrate precisely how 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> mendacious, deceitful and duplicitous the government has been on this issue. Remember, this discussion took place in June last year, within weeks of the minister having told the House repeatedly that Holsworthy was simply a fall&hyphen;back position, a form of insurance, and that Badgerys Creek was the real option. The document says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Lachlan made it clear that Badgerys Creek was dead as a viable option for the airport.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He believes that Holsworthy will be selected as the preferred site, subject to a satisfactory outcome of the EIS.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He then says that this makes it `impossible' for the nuclear reactor to continue at Lucas Heights, or for a replacement reactor to be built there. The document indicates that money from the sale of Badgerys Creek land and from Bankstown airport could be made available to help pay for the airport at Holsworthy and, more to the point, that removing the nuclear reactor from Lucas Heights `may partly negate the negative impact of the new airport'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to this document there is a financial pay&hyphen;off and a political pay&hyphen;off. The reason specified as to why the government was abandoning Badgerys Creek was the growth of residential housing in the vicinity of Badgerys Creek. What it failed to point out&mdash;and it is well known, particularly to people who live there&mdash;is that there is a substantial amount of residential housing within a couple of kilometres of the runway locations proposed for Holsworthy, so the deceit and the hypocrisy is absolutely naked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The memo tells us precisely how deceitful and duplicitous this government has been on the second Sydney airport issue. Holsworthy has been its real option all along. Badgerys Creek was abandoned from day one. The EIS process purportedly comparing the two is clearly a farce. The senior adviser to the minister for transport is on the record within the processes of the government, in a document which has been accepted as authentic by a fellow minister, stating that Badgerys Creek is dead&mdash;and that was within weeks of the Holsworthy proposal being announced. And yet, to this day, the chimera is maintained. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2590"> The government says, `Holsworthy is just the fall&hyphen;back position.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government ought to come clean. It ought to state what its true intention is. The minister ought to explain to the House why his senior staffer was telling other government officials, within weeks of the Holsworthy announcement, that that was the government's preferred option, if that is not the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has a lot of explaining to do, not only to the House but also particularly to the people of Holsworthy and the suburbs in the southern area of Sydney. He has to provide answers to the concerns of residents on the impact of that airport. He has to provide answers on the numerous environmental issues associated with the construction of an airport at Holsworthy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He has to explain, in particular, his outrageous and duplicitous behaviour, both in the House and outside it, in maintaining that an airport is going to built at Badgerys Creek, and that only if the EIS process is unsuccessful there will Holsworthy be considered, when this document makes it abundantly clear that from day one the real agenda of this government was to build an airport at Holsworthy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party believes that Holsworthy is a ridiculous site for an airport. The more I look at it, the more I wonder why it was even on the short&hyphen;list of 10 that was considered by the former government 10 or 12 years ago, let alone the primary target for an airport. This government should stop trying to deceive the people of Sydney. It should stop its outrageous, duplicitous behaviour, come clean on precisely what it intends to do, and take proper account of the communities, through consultation with local residents and associated groups, and work through the issues. It should deal honestly with the issue of a second airport for Sydney. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="2590"><TITLE>Wallis Lake</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to grieve for the oyster industry in New South Wales and, particularly, for the Wallis Lake oyster industry in my electorate, which is based on Wallis Lake at Forster&hyphen;Tuncurry. Unfortunately, the industry has been hit by disaster in recent times with the outbreak of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> hepatitis A, with about 300&hyphen;odd cases around Australia. Allegedly, 70 per cent of those cases have been traced to oysters, some of which came from Wallis Lake.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The worst thing about trying to address the problem has been the unbelievable comments made along the way by the Minister for the Environment in New South Wales, Ms Pam Allan. To date she has not been prepared to admit that she was wrong in some of the statements she made, nor has she apologised to the people of the Great Lakes area, based in Forster&hyphen;Tuncurry, for the damage that some of her comments have caused during a very difficult time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those people have been trying to manage, along with the local council, the local member, the New South Wales Department of Health and the EPA. While preparing for the grievance debate this afternoon, we were listening to the news in the office, and we heard that, only this morning, the Premier of New South Wales announced a package of measures to assist in the crisis in the Wallis Lake area. Those measures include an oyster quality assurance program, a financial assistance package, and criteria that will be used for future oyster harvesting, through which the health department will make the final determination on the basis of present scientific evidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On a number of recent occasions, contrary to the comments made by the environment minister in New South Wales, the health department has said that there is no suggestion that the risk associated with swimming in Wallis Lake is greater than anywhere else. It has cleared Wallis Lake for swimming, yet that is exactly the opposite to what the Minister for the Environment in New South Wales said earlier this month.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She has not apologised to the people in the area for the comments she has made, and now the Premier of New South Wales has had to rectify the situation on behalf of his government, albeit a little late when you look at the time frame. On 14 February, the hepatitis outbreak was announced. On 24 February, a man died from the virus, allegedly from contaminated oysters taken from Wallis Lake. In New South Wales, 300 cases of hepatitis 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2591"> A have been notified since January 1991. Allegedly, 70 per cent of those cases are from oysters, one third of which are identified as coming from Wallis Lake.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 25 February, Pam Allan attacked the council. She claimed that the Great Lakes Shire Council was guilty of gross negligence by failing to comply with an EPA order from last November to close down two sanitary depots. At the same time, Pam Allan declared Wallis Lake a non&hyphen;swimming zone. In yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, in an article headed `Minister stands firm after oyster poisoning bungle', the lead paragraph says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister for the Environment, Ms Allan, was forced yesterday into an embarrassing admission she wrongly accused a mid&hyphen;North Coast council of triggering a hepatitis A outbreak by ignoring a State Government order to clean up two sanitary depots.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">She still will not apologise to the local community. On 28 February, a preliminary EPA report ruled out the depots as the source of the outbreak. Her own department has ruled them out and proven her comments wrong, but the minister will not apologise to the people of the Great Lakes area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today, the Premier tried to prop up the situation and defend his minister, who has been negligent and irresponsible in the comments she has made about Wallis Lake. She claimed that there was a swimming ban on Wallis Lake and that signs would be erected to warn swimmers, and yet the council has had no such instructions from any minister, and the lake has never been closed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Great Lakes Mayor, Councillor John Chadban, said on 28 February in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, we expect professional help from the government rather than random criticism. This was a very serious situation which required a professional attitude from the state government. It has not received it. I commend the work done by the local council during this crisis, particularly that done by Councillor John Chadban. They have been very professional in the way they have gone about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The oyster farmers have acted responsibly. I applaud the local oyster growers for their 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> responsible actions in voluntarily withdrawing product from the market and closing down their fisheries until the crisis is resolved. They took that action immediately. I hope the state government will now provide meaningful assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I welcome the announcement by the Premier of New South Wales to assist the community and the industry in resolving the problem that has unfortunately arisen at Wallis Lake. There are two issues here. There is the issue of the alleged contamination of the oysters and what that cost is: the Wallis Lake oyster industry is worth $13 million. There is that element. There is the health element: some 300 people across Australia have been affected by the outbreak of hepatitis A; and there has been one fatality&mdash;and that is extremely sad.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a $13 million industry, an outbreak of hepatitis A, one fatality, a $35 million flow&hyphen;on effect to the local economy, 250 local jobs in the oyster industry, and a tourist industry worth tens of millions of dollars to the region. That industry has been affected by the irresponsible public comments of the Minister for the Environment in New South Wales about the closure of the lake to swimming.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The New South Wales health department has advised that all activities, including swimming and water skiing, are permitted within Wallis Lake and tributaries. The only qualification is that, within the Wallamba River, caution should be exercised during periods of heavy rain. That is the view of the New South Wales Department of Health.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is incumbent upon the media in this country to make it abundantly clear to the general population that that is the view of the New South Wales health department as far as Wallis Lake is concerned. The media in this country ran this issue very hard, and it has been very damaging to the local community. The media has a responsibility to get that message across.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The New South Wales health department has said that there are no restrictions on Wallis Lake as far as water sports and activities in the lake are concerned. It is very important to get that message across in the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2592"> lead&hyphen;up to the Easter break. The communities in Forster and Tuncurry rely heavily on the oyster industry, the fishing industry and the tourism industry. That has not been taken into account. I give marks to Premier Carr. He has taken it into account in his response, although it could have come a bit sooner. However, I still criticise the Minister for the Environment, who will not acknowledge the profound effect that her irresponsible comments had earlier this month in regard to the alleged closure of the lake. It did not happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A survey of 100 seafood retailers in New South Wales was undertaken by the Master Fish Merchants Association. Following this disaster in Wallis Lake there is evidence of a 30 per cent drop in seafood sales and an 85 per cent drop in oyster sales, which may have resulted in a loss through the restaurant trade of $15 million to $20 million. This is all within New South Wales. Thankfully, the Premier has recognised it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The allegations are that the contamination has come from effluent treatment plants. In the 1980s I was involved in the Greater Taree City Council, and in the mid&hyphen;1980s the Labor Party was in government in New South Wales. When we tried to augment sewage treatment schemes by implementing dry land disposal, the engineers with the Department of Public Works in New South Wales and the Department of Public Works itself&mdash;and this was when Bob Carr was the Minister for the Environment&mdash;would not allow local government to take that effluent out of the rivers, the tributaries and estuaries, and dispose of it on dry land, because they were philosophically opposed to it. They would not consider any option other than dumping that effluent into the tributaries. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Westpac&hyphen;Melbourne Institute leading index of economic activity rose one per cent in January, reinforcing an upward trend in the previous three months and bringing the smooth growth rate to around four per cent, the strongest rate of growth since October 1994. Of course, in October 1994 monetary policy was tightened at that period.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. As I think most honourable members would be aware, one of the most important aspects of the Workplace Relations Act is that, under part 10, we have provided for the first time an absolute guarantee for Australian workers that they have absolute freedom of choice as to whether or not they are a member of a union, so much so that we have preserved one of the items proscribed under the act in respect of unlawful termination. You cannot victimise a person because they are a member of a union. In fact, we have increased penalties against employers who victimise somebody because they exercise that choice to be a member of a union.</PARA></TALK.START>

One of the great things is that, under the Workplace Relations Act, we have abolished compulsory unionism in this country. There is no safe haven for compulsory unionism either within the state or federal jurisdictions across the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government, when it comes to the Australian Public Service, acts not just as a legislator but as an employer. We simply want to reinforce the provisions of the new act which came into operation on 1 January. We want to be satisfied that those members who have chosen to be members of a union within the Australian Public Service have provided us with a current and genuine authority that they wish their union dues to continue to be deducted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The system will be that we are writing to people within the APS. I have informed the unions. I spoke with them a couple of weeks ago about the policy and advised them of it. We are seeking from APS members a genuine, current, fresh authority from them to that effect. If that is what people wish to do, then, consistent with that principle of freedom of association, we are prepared to collect those union dues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also say, as has been the case since the day we were elected, that this is a discretion ultimately in the hands of the government. We welcome and support responsible unionism where that is the choice of members. Where people are acting irresponsibly, then of course that is a discretion&mdash;namely, the capacity to collect those dues and pass them on&mdash;which we reserve unto the government. We think that is fair and reasonable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that where people want to be in a union that is fair enough. We are prepared to talk with the unions who are genuinely representing the interests of their members.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8E4">Dr WOOLDRIDGE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. Yes, I am aware of the situation, and I thank the member for Leichhardt for alerting both me and the Therapeutic Goods Authority to it. There has been quite a deal of interest in toxic shock, and it principally relates to the third inquest into the death of a 13-year-old Mount Isa girl who died in a swimming pool in December 1994. That inquest has just concluded, and it is not proper for me to discuss that at this point in time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, Australia manufactures or imports some 400 million tampons a year. Tampons are required to be very clean, but they are not required to be sterile. As far as I know, no country in the world, other than Japan, requires sterile tampons, and Japan only does it for imports which might have an intent other than simply safety.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Toxic shock syndrome, as the honourable member said, is very rare. Its occurrence is probably fewer than one in five million women. Nonetheless, it does happen and it does have nasty consequences. Even though tampons are very safe, women do have the right to have informed consent. That is why Therapeutic Goods Order 51 was introduced by the previous government in 1995, and it was something that I, when shadow minister, supported.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We were expecting there to be a bit of a changeover time of two to three months between the old tampon boxes, which had no warning, and the new boxes, but the honourable member found, on visiting a number of supermarkets in North Queensland, that there were, in a number of cases, tampons with the old box numbers. We were able to trace these. I find it disturbing that tampons manufactured in October 1993 are being sold in North Queensland in January 1997. That clearly reflects bad stock turnover and stock control. I would not want to suggest that these tampons are in any way dangerous. There is no evidence of that but, again, women do have a right to have informed consent and be aware of the small risk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At a federal level, the Therapeutic Goods Authority controls tampons and has done since 1991, but it only controls their manufac 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2601"> ture. Australia has one large manufacturer&mdash;Johnson &amp; Johnson&mdash;which has about 60 per cent of the market. They have a national sales network which ensured, in early 1996, that there was no product left on the shelves. But smaller companies do not have a national sales network and cannot institute that measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth does not control wholesaling and retailing; the states do. I am afraid that we do not have capacity to do anything there, but I will write to all state and territory health ministers and alert them to the fact that, clearly, in some parts of Australia there is poor stock control and product over three years since the date of manufacture appearing on the shelves. I will ask that they use what power they have to ensure that this does not continue.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Wide Bay for his interest in the veteran community. Accidents&mdash;particularly as the member for Wide Bay highlighted&mdash;burns and falls, poor nutrition and medication misuse do cause pain and suffering to our veteran community and our war widows in this nation. They can often lead to a lengthy stay in hospital. Anecdotal evidence suggests that preventative care visits to the home of the elderly, incorporating education, advice and referral to health professionals, often lead to an improvement in the health, wellbeing and independence of the veterans and the elderly in our community. That is, of course, an absolute priority of this government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government, and my portfolio in particular, will have an Australian first in this area. Incorporating research with the University of Newcastle, it will trial home based preventative care visits to the homes of veterans and war widows in metropolitan Australia and rural Australia in Queensland and New South Wales. The trial will involve approximately 1,500 veterans and war widows. I can advise the member for Wide Bay that these visits and trials are likely to include veterans and war widows in the cities of Maryborough and Hervey Bay, and in that lovely rural town, Gayndah, in his electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The trials, I must stress, are voluntary. That is extremely important because we will also be selecting nurses from within the community who are specially trained to visit the homes of veterans and war widows. This is extremely important because they will be able to identify, where necessary, where some of the ills which befall our veteran community are

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question before the House today goes to one of the most important issues that Australia as a nation has to come to terms with at the moment, and that is the question of unemployment&mdash;a question that is worrying both metropolitan and regional Australia. As has become the case with the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) when questioned about these matters during question time, he now seeks, rather than to answer the questions going to the deteriorating employment situation in Australia, to deliver little homilies from the dispatch box.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is that type of approach that he took in response to a question that I raised in the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> House on 10 October last year. It went to the deterioration in the employment situation. It was last October that the Prime Minister yet again gave me one of his little homilies. In essence, he effectively told me to sit down because he does not like to be questioned about the issue of jobs. He told me that I shouldn't dare ask him a question about the most important issue facing Australia today: jobs and the rising job queues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) also likes to run away from this important issue. Instead of answering questions about the issue of employment he comes up with policies on the run that will not deliver any real opportunities to reduce the deteriorating situation of employment in Australia at the moment. He also told me to wait 12 months before I asked him a question about the job queues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The simple answer to the Prime Minister today is: time's up. Yes, time's up. We are 12 months into a three&hyphen;year parliament. One&hyphen;third of this parliament's term has now gone. Do you know what the real problem for the Prime Minister and the Howard government is? It is not just the Australian Labor Party raising these concerns any more: it is the people in the outfield, the people in metropolitan Australia, the people in regional Australia. The mob that he likes to refer to from time to time: the people who go to the cricket games, the people who go to the netball, the people who go to the football. Unfortunately, people in every suburb of Australia today know someone who is unemployed. People who are part of families in Australia today unfortunately know of a family member who is unemployed. That is the mob, that the Prime Minister likes to refer from time to time, which is concerned at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yes, time is up. The Howard government has had 12 long months&mdash;one&hyphen;third of a normal parliamentary term&mdash;to start achieving on the jobs front, to do something about the critical issue of creating real jobs in Australia. But the problem for the Howard government and the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training is that the ledger shows no results at all.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2609">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the Australian community has a right to expect some results. I'll tell you why the Australian community has a right to expect some results. The Prime Minister, just 12 months ago, went all around Australia. The truth is that the community was listening at the time of the Prime Minister's speeches because there was in the minds of the Australian community a need to try something new.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our leader said, in the wind&hyphen;up of parliament last year, that the Australian community was willing to try something new. They acknowledged the progress and the great change that occurred over 13 years for the betterment of Australia. They also acknowledged that significant progress had been made on the jobs front.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister was, in essence, elected on the promise of creating real jobs. That is what his promise was to the Australian community. He said to all those who would listen, `I will create real jobs.' He talked about the question of job security and promised to resolve the issue of youth unemployment. He told Australians at large that was what he was concerned about. He said he was going to find jobs for our young people. He was going to find jobs for the people in remote and regional Australia. He was going to find jobs for one of the real problems on the unemployment front at the moment&mdash;middle&hyphen;aged men. He was going to find jobs for all sections of Australian society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He wanted Australians to believe that he was Mr Real Jobs. In a National Press Club speech on the eve of the last election, this is what Mr Real Jobs said to the Australian community and to all the media assembled:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have gone into this election campaign committing ourselves above all other things to do something effective . . . to reduce the level of youth unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is what the Prime Minister&mdash;Mr Real Jobs&mdash;said. He then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will be a very disappointed man if I have not made very serious inroads into the level of youth unemployment in this country because I would like to see our performance in that area as being the mark of what we have been able to do as a government.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Interesting words, interesting promises.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian community, 12 months into the life of this parliament, expects some results. That is why the Australian community is saying today in very harsh terms to the Prime Minister that time is up. What is the score? Have you got any runs on the cricket board? Out there in ordinary voter land, out there amongst the battlers, the young and the families, the score looks pretty bad and it is looking worse month by month as we go into the life of this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is pretty good about chasing the headlines. But when it comes to issues of substance, actually trying to put in place practical programs that are going to produce results and assist in creating opportunities in industry, attract investment and get Australians back to work, it is an abysmal failure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As an alternative, we are not talking about real jobs in the parliament this afternoon. In a range of questions put to the Prime Minister today, we had an opportunity to see what his real program is to create real jobs in Australia. What did he talk about? I'll tell you what: he is pretty good on the headlines but awful on the issue of substance. All he could refer to was a pilot work for the dole project or, more recently, what we had floated in the newspapers of Monday last week&mdash;boot camps. That is what we have resorted to&mdash;boot camps.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even the Australian military forces, which have been known to be pretty supportive of governments in the past and to be disciplined with respect to public comment, were forced to say in fairly stark terms to the Prime Minister, `We are pretty tolerant of your action on a lot of activities, but, I'll tell you what, we can't wear boot camps.' They rejected it out of hand. When you consider the results, you have to come to some conclusions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us take the issue of youth unemployment. The truth of the matter is&mdash;the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training knows this&mdash;that the youth figures have not moved down one iota in 12 months. In reality, more importantly, they are slipping up and up&mdash;they have now reached 28 per cent. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2610"> Well might the minister hang his head in shame.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we go to the question of long-term unemployment. We slashed labour market expenditure with respect to these desperate cases. We are no longer concerned as a nation in investing public resources in getting those people back to employment. What is the scoreboard on the long-term unemployment front, as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) reminded the Prime Minister today? Long-term unemployment is at a 17&hyphen;month high. That is the result that the Prime Minister thinks his government ought to be proud of. There are an incredible 14,200 more people on the long-term unemployment queue as a result of one month's performance&mdash;the last month's performance of the Howard government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Howard government slashed what I thought was a pretty good investment. It was about Australia as a nation saying to all of us, `If you are unfortunate enough to lose a job, then we are prepared to invest in your future because we are not prepared to tolerate a situation by which there are some Australians who have got jobs, and a significant group of other Australians who do not have that second opportunity, that hope for the future&mdash;the long-term unemployed.' They slashed labour market expenditure last May. I know they like to doctor the figures about the performance of Working Nation, but the facts speak for themselves on that front&mdash;especially the facts that came out of the mouth of the minister for education at the Senate estimates hearings in recent times. More than 40,000 people have joined the long-term unemployment queue since last May.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we go to the issue of regional Australia. This is where they have really achieved&mdash;in regional Australia! Youth unemployment has gone up. Long-term unemployment has gone up by 40,000 in less than 12 months. What is the story in regional Australia? I know they are not interested in regional Australia. We no longer have a minister for regional Australia. We have got a minister for unemployment, who is sitting in the House today, but we do not have a minister for regional Australia. What are the results?</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sixteen per cent of those on the New South Wales north coast are jobless. That figure was 11.8 per cent when we lost government. We found a job up there recently for one of their mates, Doug Anthony, but we cannot find jobs for the unemployed on the north coast of New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let's go to Bendigo and Ballarat. There is a big black hole in Bendigo, where they promised an art gallery that would have assisted in creating jobs. The member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) is absent from the chamber at the moment, as is the member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson). Perhaps they are out looking for the black hole. In the Bendigo area unemployment is at 10.4 per cent. In the Ballarat area it has jumped not by half a per cent in a month but from 8.3 per cent to 10.3 per cent. If I were either the member for Ballarat or the member for Bendigo, I would be looking for that black hole very quickly. There is a stark reminder in the city of Bendigo about the importance of job creation and Working Nation. There is a stark reminder in the city of Ballarat about the importance of industry policy and making sure that we protect decent industries that create real jobs, such as the textile clothing and footwear industry and the vehicle industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we go to South Australia&mdash;another state that depends on a decent industry policy. In regional South Australia in just one month we lost 1,000 jobs. In the New South Wales central west 4,600 were thrown onto the jobless queues. I could go on but, unfortunately, time does not permit me to do so this afternoon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That takes me to the real solutions offered by the Howard government. What do we get? Work for the dole, with discounted wages on the training wage proposal that was producing the results. It was the member for Goldstein himself&mdash;the minister responsible&mdash;who admitted in the House yesterday afternoon that it was not going to produce a real job, that it really would not seriously assist in reducing youth unemployment in Australia. I suppose he is now going to suggest that it is not even a labour market program. Unfortunately, the Australian community might see it as being fairly popular at the moment, but 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2611"> I suggest to you that 10,000 places, 70 pilot programs, will not really assist in reducing youth unemployment in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian public are now starting to see what is really behind this proposal. Before the election they did not support work for the dole. A couple of weeks ago when we had to hide Senator Woods the government announced it, and it was just for young people. As we questioned them in question time it went from being for 20&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds to being for 25&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds, and now we have ended up with an open ended scheme. I suppose that is what happens when you are more concerned about creating jobs for Senator Short or Doug Anthony, or even Peter Nixon. What is Peter Nixon's real job? It is investigating the economic situation in Tasmania and how they might create jobs. Unemployment in Tasmania is pretty bad, so that is why we have got to try to create an impression that we are creating real jobs, full-time jobs. So what do we see in the media today? We are going to redefine full&hyphen;time work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we did pretty good as a Labor government. We have got a terrific record on employment, with the creation of real part&hyphen;time jobs and real full-time jobs. Importantly, that created great opportunities for women, but now we are going to try to distort the situation by the redefinition of part-time and full&hyphen;time work. The facts will speak for themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has failed. The Australian community does not feel secure as a result of the election of the Howard government. They are tense and scared. They are tense and scared as unemployment numbers go up and their jobs are placed at risk. I suggest to the Howard government that the time has come to change its budget strategies for the sake of all Australians. Promises were made and promises are being broken. Do not let Australia down on the most important issue at the moment. All Australians are entitled to a real job. It does not matter whether it is a part-time or a full&hyphen;time job. Do not seek to create a hoax by now redefining the issue of part-time as against full-time jobs.

The previous government showed itself absolutely unable to address the problem and to provide Australians with real jobs. It spent taxpayers' money, money earned by the hard work of the working families of this country, and it spent that money like water in an attempt to solve the problem through government schemes, mickey mouse training schemes and by churning the long&hyphen;term unemployed through these schemes to redefine them as short&hyphen;term unemployed. It tried every stratagem in the book but it was unable to make any significant progress whatever.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last six years of the Labor government's administration, the net additional full&hyphen;time jobs that it created numbered 7,100. And the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) has the effrontery to get up in this House, after 13 years of atrocious policy failure, to criticise this government for not solving, in 12 months, the problem that they left. At no stage throughout those 13 years did the Labor government attempt to address the fundamental reasons for unemployment in this country. I will go through those fundamental reasons one by one and look at Labor's failure on each one. They were full of rhetoric then; they are full of rhetoric now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that there has been job creation since the last election. In fact, employment in Australia now is the highest it has ever been. There are more people in jobs now in this country than there have ever been at any previous time in Australia's history. We do not claim that that is good enough. We do not go around the country trumpeting that fact and pretending that somehow or other that solves the unemployment problem; we know that there are fundamental issues that need to be addressed, that are being addressed by this government, that were not addressed for 13 years. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2612">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, policies need to be put in place that will encourage Australians to save and invest in job creation. No government in Australia's history did more to destroy savings than the Labor government. Over the last six years they accumulated something like $70 billion worth of deficits: $70 billion they did not have, they spent. And did that produce jobs? Did that produce a prosperous economy? Did that revive small business? Did it bump up investment?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No, of course it did not. It destroyed jobs because it pushed up interest rates to some of the highest real interest rates in the world. They drove small business bankruptcies to record levels. They imposed on small business industrial relations laws which absolutely bound and tied the enterprises of this country so they could not invest and have confidence in employing people. They put in place an unfair dismissals law that discouraged small businesses from taking on full&hyphen;time employees. They thought they could solve unemployment by spending, but they could not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that respect, of course, they were being absolutely true to Labor Party tradition, because that is exactly what Labor has always done. It is what they did under Whitlam; it is what they did under Hawke; it is what they did under Keating, and it is what they still want to do because they will not face up to the fact that, unless you create an environment in which small business is willing to create jobs, you will not solve the unemployment problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will digress a moment to say that last week I had the honour of speaking on behalf of, and to acknowledge the achievements of, Bert Kelly, the former member for Wakefield. Bert was known in this House for his wit in puncturing the pretensions of the hypocrites on the other side of the House. On one occasion he asked this question of Jim Cairns as Treasurer:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Last week the Treasurer told us about his policy of using deficit financing to lower the present level of unemployment. How is this solution of burying unemployment under a mountain of money actually working out?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Bert Kelly wondered:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If printing money is a good solution for the unemployment problem, why not print more of the stuff and get rid of the unemployment problem altogether?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Kelly recalled this&mdash;and it is from his book, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One More Nail</EMPHASIS> , at page 188:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And Jim Cairns, with his kind heart brimming over with love and affection, just could not resist agreeing with me and replied that that was just what the government had in mind.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And many keen political observers pinpoint the beginning of Cairns's decline from that point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here are his successors&mdash;not one, but two of them&mdash;the two big spenders, the believers in deficit financing, the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) and the member for Batman. The member for Hotham is the person who probably spent more money on labour market programs than anyone&mdash;churning the unemployed through, trying to redefine them as short&hyphen;term unemployed and not offering them any real jobs. No&hyphen;one in this parliament has ever had so much experience in spending other people's money to achieve nothing as has the member for Hotham, the man who has pretensions to becoming the leader of the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sitting next to him is his clone, the member for Batman, who berates the government today for its failure to deal with this problem. The member for Batman has plans to spend even more money. He has plans to ensure that there will be absolutely unlimited access to the labour market services provided by government. That is why he criticises this government&mdash;because we are not planning to provide unlimited access to these services. The Labor Party in government&mdash;not even under the member for Hotham&mdash;did not provide unlimited access, but the member for Batman thinks that there should be unlimited access. He is prepared to spend not merely $2 billion but maybe $4 billion or $6 billion, and all of that money will come out of Australian small business. He is not going to get it all through the tax system but, to the extent that he does, it will come out of the pockets of battling families. To the extent that he borrows to get it, it will push up interest rates and we will be back in that whole destructive cycle the Labor Party was responsible for that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2613"> has left this country with the unemployment problem that it now has.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These schemes that they put in place to address unemployment, because they had no way of creating real jobs, were tremendously destructive of the morale of those who went through them. Of course, the member for Hotham knows that very well because he attended, as I did, the Jobs for Young Australians conference in South Australia in August last year. There was one very clear message that was given by the hundreds of young people at that conference and that was, `Stop putting us through Simon Crean's short&hyphen;term training programs. We do not all want to be horticulturalists. We are not all interested in the history of dance in this country. We do not see careers in that. We want training that leads to real jobs.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is our commitment, and that is why we have picked up that great historic program, the apprenticeship program, which Labor, at the behest of its union mates, did so little about. Of course, the member for Hotham and the member for Batman know all about that because they were the union mates. They have come out of the closet and they are sitting there now trying to sell us the same old snake oil medicine that the Australian people rejected at the election last year. They so despised the traditional apprenticeship system and did so little that in 1995 the number of young people in apprenticeships and traineeships as a proportion of the work force was the lowest for three decades. We have put in place the foundations of a new national apprentice system which will&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new Australian apprenticeship and traineeship system will provide young people

It will build up the status of traineeships and we, for the first time, will provide school students in the senior secondary years with the opportunity to move straight from school into those quality training opportunities. Indeed, under the reforms we are putting in place, they will be able to begin traineeships and apprenticeships in school.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He could take any of them off the shelf. But let us just have a look at what the Labor Party thought about job sharing in government in former years when we were in opposition. In December 1993 the discussion paper `Restoring Full Employment', commissioned and published by the Keating government, said that job sharing may, in some cases, increase employment in the short term but leads to a poorer long-term employment result, primarily because it lowers overall productivity levels and, therefore, per capita incomes. That was the conclusion of the policy analysts of the Labor Party when they were in government. They were not proposing 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2614"> job sharing at that time. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> , on 6 February of this year, reported:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ALP's largest affiliate union, AMWU, has come out strongly against a proposal by the federal opposition&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is by the member for Batman, the shadow minister for employment&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to encourage job sharing, arguing: `It will not support the sharing of poverty.'</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That, of course, is precisely what the member for Batman does support. That is what job sharing amounts to: the sharing of poverty. They have given up on creating real jobs. They have no idea how to create real jobs, so they say, `Let us share around the jobs we have currently got; let us take away a third or a half of the jobs of people currently in employment and give them to somebody else.' It is the kind of nonsense that the Australian people hear from the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course the reason they are hearing this nonsense is that there is no policy direction in the Labor Party. The Labor Party have no idea whatever where to go. They do not know what to do about work for the dole. They do not know what to do about employment. They are wandering around in the darkness clutching at anything, because in the end they have a leadership which has no purpose and direction. They have weak leadership. The only person who thinks there might be a job for himself out of that weak leadership is none other than the member for Hotham. Job sharing is something he is right into, and he would like to share 100 per cent of that job as soon as possible.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we have finally revealed the solution of the Howard government to create real jobs: redefine them. It is to take part-timers and call them full&hyphen;timers. Now we have a situation where so long as you work 20 hours a week you have a real job. What a sham. Where does this come from? It comes from the master of obfuscation, the master doctorer. No wonder he has the title Dr Kemp&mdash;this Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training&mdash;because he doctors every figure going, and he is at it again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting that history has a way of repeating itself. In the back of my mind, there 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> was this little recollection about the Fraser government years when they were having trouble with rising unemployment. What did they seek to do? Redefine the problem. Here we have, in the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> of 11 September 1978, the heading `Jobless figures can be what you make them'. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>: `Lies, damned lies and statistics: the conflict of figures on jobless.' This was Malcolm Fraser in 1978. Who was his adviser? Dr Kemp was the adviser. Here was this man in Malcolm Fraser's office, the arch idealogue of the Fraser government, the author of the reactionary right wing ideology of the Fraser government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This minister is a recycled man. This is the man who gave us all that talk about dole bludgers and vouchers; the speech writer who helped stigmatise the unemployed. This is the same man, recycled from 1977, back to his old tricks. Now he has modern equipment. He has the white&hyphen;out. He has the tape to patch up figures to re&hyphen;present them in different ways. He recycles the same tired slogans, the same divisive attacks on the unemployed. He is a master of right wing ideology, but the fact is he is a failure as a minister for employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only is he a failure but the budget strategy is a failure. He has been parroting on about the jobs that have been created since their budget. Today we had the Treasurer (Mr Costello) come in and talk about employment&mdash;the first time he has actually come in and talked about employment in this House&mdash;and he relied on the DEETYA leading indicator, because he said that it had finally turned up. It is true it has turned up, but it has only turned up to what we left them. This is the record that they would criticise us on. Now they are claiming credit for merely having achieved that which we put in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To give some real impact of the budget strategy, let me just say this: since the last budget, job growth in this economy has been 6,000 a month; one-third of what Labor achieved. We have also seen a circumstance in which since the last budget they have lost 34,000 full-time jobs. No wonder he is redefining them. The only way they can get their commitment to any sort of job activity is to call 20 hours a full-time and real job. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2615"> What a grubby little exercise coming from the master of obfuscation, the doctorer of statistics, the person who was driven by ideology but who has no commitment, no compassion and no intention of doing anything for the long-term unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mr Wilton interjecting</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr CREAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The very program he gloats about and laughs about every time he says that we are spending $2 billion on the long&hyphen;term unemployed. We make no apology for that because it was a program that worked. What we have seen since you have been in office is 40,000 more long-term unemployed back on the dole queues. This is a great achievement, Minister, in the space of but 12 months. We all know this has always been your intention. The trouble is you just wanted to hide it from people. But we will not let you hide it, Minister. You have an obligation to stand up in this place, as a minister committed to getting unemployment down, and come up with real programs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember you saying that at least the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Mr Ruddock, said on the record at one stage that there was no intention of forcing mature age people&mdash;that is, those who are over 50&mdash;to do voluntary work to receive their benefit. That was a promise made with the attention of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) at a meeting. What did we see in your legislation yesterday? No age limit. It is not just a question of forcing young people into boot camps; you are also forcing older people into meals on wheels. What sort of dignified approach is that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, your work for the dole is a part-time activity. At least this is consistent with your attempt to redefine the problem away. But why won't you give young people full-time activity? Why won't you give them real training? Why won't you involve the private sector in this activity, as the premier from Victoria has been suggesting you do? If this argument about work for the dole is worth doing, do it properly for God's sake! Young people deserve more, and so does everyone else in the work force looking to get back into employment. They are not getting eco 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> nomic activity from you and they are not getting any compassion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Green Corp was the other program that was much heralded to provide environmental action. It resulted in 2,000 jobs. Labor was creating 27,000 environment jobs a year, and this little grubby exercise comes up with 2,000 over three years. But it gets worse. Of the people who have been placed so far&mdash;only 254 of them&mdash;most of them were employed. This is their program for the unemployed. Give the programs to the employed! What foolishness are you carrying on with over there in the department? You cannot get away with simply continuing to doctor the figures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me come to the motor industry, because this is vital to employment prospects in both Victoria and South Australia. We have the circumstance in which this government will not stand up and be counted in backing the car industry. We have the situation in which we have ministers from South Australia prepared to come out and stick up for the car industry&mdash;that is, Ministers Hill and Vanstone&mdash;but not Minister Downer and Minister McLachlan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister McLachlan not only has difficulty spelling out the program for the car industry but, in his defence, also has difficulty spelling his own name. The Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> of the other day had an article headed `PM backs silent MPs on car industry'. I bet their electorate doesn't. There is also a picture here of the Bananas in Pyjamas twins. B1 and B2 sitting over there, silent as ever, cannot even get their position up. B1 and B2: the member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) and the member for Mayo (Mr Downer). We all know that the member for Mayo is very keen on these characters. He probably has copies of them in the doll's house on the family property.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know what the strategy for the car industry is by this government. The outcome of this cosy little dinner at Canberra's most exclusive club, the Commonwealth Club, was revealed to us a couple of weeks ago. John Moore actually stays there, so he did not have too far to go home. Minister Costello was able to get into the ministerial limousine. So they could indulge themselves a bit in the cigars and the cognac.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2616">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There they were, late in the evening. John Moore said, `Can you give us your vision for the car industry, Treasurer?' The Treasurer said, `I have a vision for the car industry: it's to close the Mitsubishi plant in Adelaide. This country can't afford four car manufacturers. We should reduce it down to three.' The simple facts of the matter are that there is room for four car manufacturers in this country, only if you get the right policies in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is Labor's commitment. It is not just about freezing tariffs and it is not about winding back the clock; it is about giving them security. It is about ensuring that we help them to get into export markets, so we need to keep the export facilitation scheme. But, at the same time, we have an agreement from the industry that if we put in place this plan we will create 10,000 new jobs and we will double exports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For a government that said that it was trying to correct the current account and for a government that said it was trying to create jobs, why would it look this gift&hyphen;horse in the mouth? Yet it does. It stands there dumbfounded. The only solution for the car industry in this country is for this government to get behind Labor's plan for the car industry.

Well, they did not six months after the 3 March by&hyphen;election in Lindsay. Now, 12 months after the by-election, I am sure we would get another five per cent increase in our vote.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor is going absolutely nowhere. It has gone nowhere since the 1990 recession where we had 11.2 per cent of Australians unemployed, and the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) professes concern. Oh, he is terribly worried. His heart is breaking for 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the battlers&mdash;for the people at the football. What about the battlers of Lindsay? What about the guys who had to sit there as Labor doled out a 40 per cent increase on sales tax, as they were strangled by the regulation that the Labor Party put on small business, as they suffered tax hike after tax hike, as they suffered ridiculously high interest rates and as the Labor government destroyed Commonwealth savings?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1992 the Labor government spent $11&half; billion more than they collected. In 1992&hyphen;93 the budget figures show that they spent $17 billion more than they collected; in 1993-94, another $17 billion more than they collected; in 1994&hyphen;95, another $13.2 billion more than they collected. Evidence that they were still on the same track&mdash;if the Liberal Party had not returned to government&mdash;is Beazley's black hole. The 1995-96 figures came up with a $10.3 billion deficit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How did the Labor Party pay for this&mdash;the party that stood for government enterprise, the party that stood for non&hyphen;privatisation? They sold off Qantas, they sold off the uranium stockpile, they sold off ASTA, the sold off the FAC, CBA and ANL. There is not really much left for us to sell when it comes to fund the $5.6 billion deficit we are facing this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The deficit is slowly coming down. We are slowly getting Commonwealth savings back into government in Australia. This government will slowly get money in the bank so that, if we do suffer a hiccup such as a recession, we do not have 11.2 per cent unemployed as we did in 1992. We will have savings. We can spend our way out of a recession. That is why Labor could do nothing about the deteriorating labour figures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite an economic upturn from December 1995 until March 1996, unemployment went from 8.1 per cent to 8.5 per cent. Australia was in a mess, and the country knew it. The numbers in parliament are proof of this. Those very same ex&hyphen;ACTU members and ex&hyphen;union bosses, who sit there with their fancy deals and sell their members' interests out to big business to keep themselves a nice cushy job through the union movement into parliament, stand here today and betray the very people they were sent to represent. What 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2617"> happens? Those people turn to people like me&mdash;an ordinary Australian, a PAYE taxpayer&mdash;to come here and represent their interests, and, I tell you, they are very happy with what we are doing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead of coming up with a solution, Labor came up with NWOS, new work opportunity schemes. They cost $10,000 a head. They had a 21 per cent success rate, and the rest of it was wasted money. Do you know what the beautiful thing about that is? Those people did not count in the unemployment figures. Those people were counted as training, so they were not unemployed. At the end of their LEAP project, new wave project or any of those other government sponsored programs, they went back into the short&hyphen;term unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Talk about fiddling the figures. If you are worried about how statistics lie, let us have a look at what Labor were doing to the unemployed: they were not counting these figures in the unemployment statistics. They make wild allegations that our minister had anything to do with those figures in 1978. He was not even there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you work for one hour a week, even if it is in a family business, then on the ABS statistics you come up as not unemployed. The distinction between employed and unemployed has not changed. The facts and figures we are talking about here are exactly the same, and the changes in the definition of part&hyphen;time and full&hyphen;time work have only occurred for administrative reasons in the employment placement enterprises. They will receive government sponsorship for their money, if the person they have placed has entered full&hyphen;time employment&mdash;defined as more than 20 hours a week for six months. I do not know why the ACTU is making such a big thing about this. It stands to reason that, if this enterprise has got these people into a job&mdash;and let us define job&mdash;they should get paid for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the facts and figures that the ABS uses to come up with full&hyphen;time and part&hyphen;time statistics have not changed. There has been no diddling of the unemployment figures. We have crystallised the unemployment figures. We have not hidden them in programs; we 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have crystallised unemployment. If you are on the dole now, we know you are. We have a work for the dole scheme, you can join the army, you can do a whole bunch of things, but we recognise that you are unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And we recognise that another of Labor's solutions&mdash;`give them a government job'&mdash;is not a solution. Under Labor, one out of every five jobs was in the state government, local council or Commonwealth public services. Again, the people in the other four jobs had their hands heavily in their pockets to pay for the person in the fifth job. We have recognised that those are not real jobs. You cannot hide unemployment figures and stack the books that way. In the end, we have to pay for our public servants and, if there is no money, there is no money to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other solution the opposition has come up with is job sharing. Let us share a job&mdash;you beauty! `Wow, I can have a full&hyphen;time job and bring things home for my kids and my family and my spouse, and we can go away on weekends, or I can have a part&hyphen;time job.' What do you think workers want? They want full&hyphen;time jobs. In the last 12 months we have crystallised unemployment and we have set some very strategic groundbreaking measures in place to get out of the rut and off the track to disaster that we were on on 3 March 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has not been easy. It has been a long haul. We have not had much help from the opposition in the Senate. We have not been able to act quickly. Even so, we have balanced the budget. We are heading towards a target in 2000 where we will have government savings to help kick&hyphen;start us out of recession. With that has come a certain amount of offshore confidence which has lowered interest rates. Do not underestimate what impact that has had&mdash;the flow&hyphen;on effects are just coming now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We now have low inflation and we have flexible workplace relations, which only came in January. Given time, both of those will see an increase in jobs. We have also got individually tailored assistance for the unemployed: they can get the skills that they need and they are still recognised as unemployed and counted in the unemployment statistics.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is probably fair to concede that this collection of superannuation bills is controversial. I was interested to listen in the chamber last night to the shadow Treasurer, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans), make his contribution to the debate. If you take out a lot of the words and the rhetoric that he threw in, and for which he is renowned, you will find that he actually made some rather interesting and, I might concede, telling points.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some questions about this package of legislation which, it is a well&hyphen;known fact, we on this side have been asking and which we have been concerned about. As I have said, if you take out some of the words of the shadow Treasurer's contribution, on balance you will find he made some debatable points.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A lot of the difficult decisions that we on this side have had to make since coming to government have to be put in the context of the fiscal situation as we found it at that time. Of course, it would have been much easier to come to government with a clean slate and with the opportunity to not only do things which needed to be done but also continue those many programs which had some merit and were introduced by the previous government, which spent with impunity on so many programs for so long, and we are now bearing the cost of that. You could name lots of programs which had considerable merit, such as the Commonwealth Dental Service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We came into government with the enormous task of turning this country's finances around. That was a difficult task and it affected every portfolio area. I notice that the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) is in the House at the moment. His portfolio was particularly affected. But all areas were affected because of the need to get the fiscal position in order.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2622">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that context, we have been looking to raise revenue. I take it that the main thrust of this measure is to achieve that objective. I think there are some other arguments for it. Some of my colleagues&mdash;I note that not many will be speaking on this bill&mdash;will probably make some of those points. The measure is intended to raise something in the order of $450 million. From the government's budgetary point of view, it is a very important measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I notice that the opposition is not intending to oppose the measure outright, although it has moved an amendment. If one looks at the amendment on a point by point basis, breaking through some of the rhetoric, one will find that it seeks to condemn the government for breaking solemn commitments, made before the election, not to raise the rate of existing taxes or introduce new ones.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We did make that commitment and by and large we have maintained it in very difficult circumstances. We can deal with the semantics of this issue as to whether it is a surcharge or whether it is a tax, but in the end I do not think it is terribly productive to do that. In the context of the fiscal difficulties we faced when we came to government, it is understandable that we had to take some steps. We could not do it with our hands entirely tied behind our backs. So this is one important measure which is intended to raise $450 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We wanted to raise it in a way that was fair. It is reasonable to argue that this measure is essentially a fair measure. It is intended to impose an additional commitment on those who can afford to pay&mdash;essentially high income earners. Those earning $75,000 and above would be classed as high income earners. It has the virtue of equity, which is an important argument for taking this measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition amendment suggests that we are attempting to deceive the Australian public by not admitting that this measure is a tax. Once again, I say to the opposition that that is semantics. It is a pointless argument. I make the point again that, in the budgetary context, we have honoured our commitment, if not entirely to the letter then very sub 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> stantially to the letter and in the spirit of the commitment that was made to the Australian people. I think that is widely recognised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment makes the suggestion&mdash;again, it reflects the shadow Treasurer's garrulity&mdash;that the government is `deliberately inflicting on the superannuation industry an impossibly cumbersome, inefficient and expensive collection method'. That may be so. Certainly, it has been a concern raised not only by the industry but by others. They have suggested that the administrative complexities will be enormous and pointed out that the costs will be directly or indirectly borne by all members of funds and their employers. They are saying that there is going to be an administrative expense involved&mdash;I have heard a figure of perhaps as much as $30 million&mdash;in collecting it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps there are other ways of collecting the surcharge but, on balance, in the discussions that we have had with the Treasurer (Mr Costello) on this matter, this appears to be the best way to collect the levy. Any other way of collecting it would place a burden on a larger number of either individual taxpayers or small businesses. In the end, it comes down to what the most effective way of collecting it is, and this appears to be the answer to that. Part (d) of their amendment restates that point, using a number of other adjectives and adverbs, and, as I say, in the shadow Treasurer's best style, and (e) and (f) do not contribute much to it. The important point is that the opposition recognises that this is an important revenue raising measure and ultimately, I think, recognises, as I understood what the shadow Treasurer was saying, that it had the merit of largely being imposed on high income earners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose the point ought to be made that it has the virtue of impacting on members of parliament. I suppose, as far as the public at large is concerned, it is a considerable virtue. In fact, when you think about it, it is probably its most potent selling point. I do not think any amount of self&hyphen;inflicted pain is likely to attract even the mildest applause from the public because there is a perception out there that our salaries and benefits are generous. I have sought, on occasions, to win an argu 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2623"> ment on that, but I have never been successful. I do not think even the most verbally dexterous member of this place could win an argument with anybody on that issue, so I will not even attempt to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point should be made that, quite deliberately, all members of parliament will be affected by this legislation. We deliberately included ourselves in that. The Treasurer has made a point of ensuring that that fact is well known. The concern I have, which I ought to put on the record, is that we are not certain what the effect will be on us. In a sense, we are all signing a blank cheque here. I do not say that lightly but the complexity, which I concede is a factor, is making it very difficult for us to get an accurate determination of what the actual impact might be on members of parliament. It is likely to be substantial and it is certain that we will be paying at least our fair share, if not more, of the superannuation surcharge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am, I think, able to say to the parliament that this, hopefully, will be the end of fiddling with superannuation for a number of years to come. I do not say that lightly because there have been a lot of changes in superannuation over the years. Over 13 years of the former government there were numerous changes and prior to the last election we had got to the point where people, if they had not lost confidence in superannuation, were fairly close to losing confidence in it and giving up on it simply because, even if it was a good investment&mdash;and it was and is, despite the surcharge, I believe&mdash;there is nevertheless an element of complexity about it and, dare I say, an element of a lack of trust, that it is seen as a milch cow and an easy target for governments of any complexion to seek to raise revenue from it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are certainly not pre&hyphen;empting any budgetary announcement here, but I believe I have detected in the Treasurer's comments on this subject some sort of commitment, which I hope will be put in cement at budget time, to let the superannuation scene settle down, let there be stability for the foreseeable future&mdash;and I am talking 10 or 20 years ahead&mdash;so that people can regain their confi 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> dence in superannuation, because it is so important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the 1970s, there has been a revolution in superannuation in Australia. Up until that time, superannuation was the province of a limited number of executives, mainly men I would say, and I suppose public servants, but from the early 1980s, when the extent of Australia's ageing population problem became apparent, superannuation has been encouraged as the principal means of saving for retirement. Many people have had the opportunity to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the context of our ageing population, it needs to be pointed out that the prediction of the Bureau of Statistics is that our population of over 65s will increase from 2.1 million in 1993 to 5.1 million in the year 2035. That makes the point very clearly that not only is the Australian population ageing but it is ageing at an increasing rate, in fact, at a great rate. It accentuates the importance of making people aware of the fact that they will have to save for their own retirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point in this context that needs to be understood is that people can expect to spend up to one&hyphen;third of their lives in retirement and, very clearly, because of that long period in retirement&mdash;25 or even more years&mdash;it is a lot of years in which they will not be working when they will not be able to depend on the government to provide for that retirement. So once again, it accentuates the importance of people understanding that they will have to save for their own retirement and that superannuation has been and will continue to be the main avenue for that particular saving.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe people must be weaned off&mdash;that is what it will require&mdash;an unrealistic expectation that somehow it will be okay when they retire, somehow the government will provide. The fact is that the government cannot provide and certainly, by that time, will not be able to provide full support for people in their retirement. If you do the maths of it&mdash;and I have not done that, but I can guess&mdash;there will just not be enough people in the work force able to pay enough tax to provide for the 5.1 million people by 2035 who will be 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2624"> over 65. It is going to be a mathematical impossibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People must be encouraged to save. In saying that I mean that they must be encouraged to invest for their retirement and to use those savings for that purpose. That is a radical change. It is a change that has only dawned on us in the last five or 10 years. I think it was a change that the former government brought about. It brought us to that point although it was controversial and difficult. I notice the former Treasurer, the member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis), is in the House at the moment. Obviously he realised, as the government of the day did, that we had to get people to a point where they understood that they had to save for their retirement and be prepared to use those savings to support themselves in retirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also learnt to understand&mdash;the former government went well down that track and we are moving further down that track&mdash;that middle class welfare is no longer an option. Ironically, we could not afford it before; we certainly cannot afford it now. People who can afford to save and invest for their retirement must be encouraged if not coerced into doing so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We now find ourselves in a situation where people are not just encouraged to have superannuation, but it is mandated. Whilst that was a controversial decision at the time&mdash;and I think in opposition there were a lot of aspects of that compulsion which a number of us in the coalition had some difficulty with&mdash;we now accept that it is a fact of life. I believe we are committed to the ongoing success that that system should have in getting people to contribute, although we recognised at the time that it was a very long-term project. Once we get to the year 2030&mdash;when I say `we' I suppose I mean those who are still around&mdash;this will probably be looked at as the right thing to have done at the time. As the level of employer support grows from five per cent to I think it will be nine per cent in the year 2001 that system should really start to kick in and begin to be seen to be working.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By June 1996 there were 140,000 superannuation entities operating in Australia. It is a very substantial industry. Assets at March 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 1996 were $243.8 billion, which is around 60 per cent of our GDP. Perhaps now it has reached $260 billion. There are various estimates going around about what it might be by the year 2000, but it will certainly be a large amount of money compared with, say, 1983 when it only added up to $35 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Superannuation has been an attractive investment option up until now and it has contributed significantly to Australia's pool of savings. We need more savings in order to finance investment. We need investment if we are going to have the economic growth that is necessary to provide employment. That is an important component of the solution to the large and totally unacceptable levels of unemployment that we still have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Superannuation is also needed to avoid any further movement into debt. We have a net national debt of over $200 billion and it seems that it is going to be very difficult to wind that back. If we in this country do not provide savings for investment purposes from our own sources then the only way we will be able to achieve those goals and create growth and employment is by borrowing from other people's savings. One of the real imperatives we have in government in this country is improving Australia's abysmal record of national savings, and superannuation is an important part of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, I concede&mdash;and I have been one who has at least been reasonably aware of what is going on in this very complex area that I think is a challenge for most members of parliament and certainly most members of the public to get their minds around&mdash;that these pieces of legislation are difficult and controversial. Some of the points made in the opposition's amendment, which seeks to take out some of the words, I think we would concede up to a point because of the fact that it is clearly not possible to deny, at least in some aspects, that there are some questions concerning the implementation of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think there are some questions about how much money it will eventually raise, particularly if people lose confidence, as they have done in recent years, about superannuation as an investment. I believe it is a good invest 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2625"> ment and, as I said earlier, in spite of the surcharge it will continue to be a very good investment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the second reading amendment to this superannuation contributions surcharge legislation moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans). The professed aim of the bills now before the House is to improve the equity of the tax system in relation to superannuation. The source of the alleged inequity in the present system is that we have a system which essentially taxes at a flat rate and gives greater benefits to people on higher incomes. The bill proposes to redress that by proposing a surcharge or an additional tax, to give it its proper title, on people on higher incomes in respect of their superannuation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say firstly that we do not oppose increasing the equity of the superannuation system. Clearly Labor in government demonstrated that amply because the system we inherited from the previous government when the now Prime Minister (Mr Howard) was the Treasurer was one which had virtually no tax on superannuation at all. The only tax on superannuation was the five per cent tax on the superannuation lump sum and you paid that at marginal tax rates. At 60c in the dollar, which was the top marginal tax rate in those days, you paid three per cent tax. That was John Howard's tax regime for superannuation&mdash;three per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We changed that in many respects. It was also, I must say, a system which was there mainly for higher income earners, because low income earners did not have superannuation. It was not something that was available to them, except for those who worked for governments. But for the ordinary, run&hyphen;of&hyphen;the&hyphen;mill private sector employee, there was no such superannuation available&mdash;40 per cent of the population had superannuation, and most of them were higher income earners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we did two things. We made superannuation generally available, which improved 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the equity because then everyone was entitled to superannuation. We did that through awards, the super guarantee system&mdash;the legislative approach&mdash;and then, of course, by changing the tax regime. The tax regime was eventually changed so that we had a 15 per cent tax on the contributions and a 15 per cent tax on the earnings on the fund. For lump sums, they were free of tax up to what is now $86&half; thousand and then 15 per cent tax on the rest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For pensions, they were taxed at the marginal tax rate minus 15 per cent, reflecting the 15 per cent that had been paid at the contributions and earning stage. So the tax rate, if you took a lump sum, was between 15 per cent and 30 per cent compared to the three per cent under the now Prime Minister when he was Treasurer. For a pension, there was simply no concession. You paid tax effectively at your marginal tax rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to unfunded schemes, tax was only on the end benefits. For lump sums, it was 15 per cent on the front $86&half; thousand and then 30 per cent. For pensions, tax was at the marginal tax rate. So, again, the total tax rate was between 15 per cent and 30 per cent for the lump sums and no concessions on pensions. That is the system on which all of this is being added.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, we sought to limit the extent to which people could utilise the concessionality that was in the system through the introduction of RBLs&mdash;reasonable benefits limits&mdash;which set limits on how much you could take as a lump sum and how much you could take in terms of the total package, including pensions. So it was not there for complete exploitation with people with very high incomes being able to milk this for all it was worth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So they were major steps towards improving the equity of the superannuation system, enormous steps compared to what was there before. Now everyone benefited from superannuation and the tax regime was far fairer. So we have very good credentials in that respect, but also we proposed to build on that through another system which was to provide for compulsory employee contributions, up to three per cent, from July 1999 and a matching 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2626"> means tested government co&hyphen;contribution of up to three per cent of average weekly ordinary time earnings for employees' contributions. This also applied to the self-employed in respect of their undeducted contributions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we had the second leg of the tax cuts being converted into a payment, a matching co&hyphen;contribution, into superannuation payable only to low and middle income earners. The top income earners were not going to get a penny out of that, not a cent out of the second leg of the tax cuts because they had been means tested out of it. It was all going into private sector savings, through superannuation, matching contributions to low and middle income earners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we were certainly going to add to the equity of the system in a very big way by that approach, an approach which I think has effectively now been abandoned. Of course, that would have boosted savings. Treasury estimated it would increase savings by one per cent of GDP by the year 2005 and 1.7 per cent by the year 2020, and of course it also considerably improved the equity of the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now we have a government adopting a different approach. I must say, we see considerable problems with the way the government proposes to increase equity in the legislation now before the House. Firstly, there is the suggestion of unconstitutionality by certainly an eminent person&mdash;Dennis Rose, the former Chief General Counsel to the Attorney-General. Whether he is right or not, I do not know. All I know is that there is certainly a substantial chance that there could be some unconstitutionality involved in the approach taken here. There is also, obviously, the problem with the states. I do not want to go into that in any further detail because it has been well covered by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also see considerable problems with the way the government proposes to increase equity, and some of them are directly related to the way the government has designed this measure to try to avoid the tax label. It is petrified of labelling the thing as a tax because it promised not to introduce any new 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> taxes&mdash;and clearly this is a new tax, along with various other new taxes. It is trying desperately to dress it up as something other than a tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a tax, quite clearly, and Dennis Rose said it clearly was. Although this tax is supposedly levied only on higher income earners, one of the really bad effects of this approach is that many lower income earners will be forced to pay the tax because, if they do not supply their tax file number to the super fund, which is to be reported to the tax office, they will pay the 15 per cent tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is highly likely that many low and middle income earners will not supply their tax file number to the fund. They will not do it because they do not understand the consequences of not doing so, or because they are lost members. Lost members can be as high as 20 per cent of members&mdash;that is, people that the fund has lost touch with. So they cannot notify them to say, `If you don't give us the tax file number, we can't pass it on and you'll be liable to the tax.' They cannot even tell them that, and many of those they do tell are not really going to understand the implications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will also, of course, be people who will have supplied the tax file number to their employer and think that that is adequate. So they have already given it to someone and think, `Why can't the employer pass it on,' or think he is going to but, in fact, he cannot because of the privacy provisions around the tax file number. So, for various reasons, you are not going to get the tax file number passed on by many low and middle income earners who will, therefore, be subject to this tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If only 10 per cent of them did not put in their tax file number, you would be looking at something like three&hyphen;quarters of a million people who would be involved. The industry estimates about a million. Of course, they have some experience in this. They have been trying to get people to give them their tax file number. There has been a situation where there has not been the added incentive of a tax if you do not, but they have had very poor results&mdash;up to about 20 per cent at best, five per cent to 20 per cent of returns. So they are 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2627"> not getting the kind of return from their members that gives them any confidence at all that they will get everyone providing the tax file number. This is terribly important because this whole thing is supposed to be about equity but, if there are vast numbers of low income earners paying this tax, it is going to have very inequitable effects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All employees at whatever income level will be adversely affected by the cost of administration that this measure will foist on the super funds. Estimates of these costs are around $100 million in the first year and $30 million ongoing. It is a tremendously high administrative cost to raise around $500 million, which is the supposed revenue from the tax. And that does not include the ATO's admin costs, which are also going to be very high.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why are these costs so high? It is because the super funds have to gather and pass information to the tax office in respect of over 16 million accounts, just so that 355,000 higher income earners can be subjected to the surcharge. What an incredibly crazy administrative approach. Sixteen million accounts have to be processed in order to tax 355,000 people. It is just absurd. And this is from a government which parades itself as being here to cut the costs of red tape for small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that many small businesses wear the costs of their superannuation schemes and they cover those administrative costs themselves directly rather than putting them om the fund. And they will wear these costs and they are going to scream. They are going to say, `How does this fit with your promise about cutting red tape by 50 per cent?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Through lack of time, I will not go through all of the ways in which the super funds bear these costs. But they are considerable administrative costs and they are going to have this ridiculous impact on the funds because what they do is reduce returns, therefore the fees are going to have to be higher. They are going to have to cover those higher costs by increased fees or reduced returns to members, and so you have an outcome where all members of superannuation funds, even if they all supply their tax file number, are going to be 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> adversely affected, because they will wear those higher charges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, eligible termination payments&mdash;that is, golden handshakes, retirement bonuses, redundancy payments&mdash;will all be caught up in this tax net. Of course, with redundancy payments there is an allowance for the tax free area which is, I think, $4,348 plus $2,174 per year. But anything over that gets caught up in this net. Many employees who have been sacked and then get a redundancy pay are going to find that that additional redundancy pay takes them into the bracket of high income earners. Therefore, they will be subject to the surcharge; therefore, just at the time that they get sacked they get hit with an additional tax, and then of course they are facing unemployment. And then the government says, `Hang on. Before you can claim any unemployment benefits, we are going to take your super benefits into account as well.' It is like a triple whammy&mdash;you got sacked, you got hit with extra tax and then you got means tested on your superannuation. It seems as though there is a vendetta against these sorts of people. This is surely incredibly inequitable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also the fact that the transitional arrangements for golden handshakes last only five years, till 2001. After that, any golden handshake you get, which might be in respect of service that goes back 20 or 30 years before this legislation came into effect, gets taxed in full. It is real retrospective taxation. It is an outrage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, the way in which this legislation proposes to deal with unfunded defined benefit schemes is absolutely bizarre. An unfunded scheme of course has no annual employer contribution to tax, so what this legislation proposes is that  such funds should for each member maintain a surchargable debt account, which will be calculated each year by use of a notional surcharge contribution rate obtained from tables currently being prepared by the Institute of Actuaries and agreed by the Australian Government Actuary and the Australian Taxation Office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the funds will be keeping these notional accounts&mdash;only notional accounts because there is no contribution while the person is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2628"> actually in the fund&mdash;so they have the administrative expense of keeping that each year and putting an interest rate on it as well. And then they will inevitably find at the end of the day that it is not the right amount because the right amount can be determined only by the circumstances of the person when they retire. Whether it is voluntary or involuntary retirement, how long they have been in the system and so on will change the type of benefit they take. So just why there is a need to keep these notional accounts is beyond me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, these actuarial tables have not been prepared yet. So no&hyphen;one in such a fund, which includes many public servants and members of parliament, knows what the impact of this legislation will be, as the member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) said. And most importantly, the government does not know, but it is bringing legislation into this House, saying, `We are going to impose a tax and we don't know what the impact is.' They cannot even tell us what the impact is on us&mdash;let alone tell anybody else outside in respect of these unfunded schemes. They simply do not know. So this is a bizarre state of affairs. What an incredibly poor legislative approach it is to bring in legislation when you have no idea what the impact is on those whom it is going to affect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of the parliamentary super scheme, the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) is saying. `Well, this might have an impact of around 13 per cent, we think. But we don't really know.' But there are calculations being made in the industry which say that this impact could be more of the order of over 50 per cent reduction in the end benefit. That is before normal taxation cuts in. So those calculations are out there, and what is the government saying about that? What is it saying to the public servants about their unfunded scheme?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is simply incredible gall to bring in legislation not knowing what the impact will be. It is just incredible legislative laxity. It means the government does not know what it is doing, does not know what the revenue impacts are&mdash;because it cannot know them if it does not know what the impact will be on individuals&mdash;and it cannot say what the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> impact is on people whose lives are affected by this very legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This tax will also have the perverse effect of discouraging many people from putting their money into superannuation, as the member for McPherson acknowledged, because they will see very little tax advantage. Indeed, there will be no tax advantage if they take a pension. That is because those subject to this new tax will be taxed at rates higher than the top marginal tax rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those with funded schemes, the contribution rate will now be 30 per cent, there will be an earnings tax rate of 15 per cent and a pension tax rate of the marginal tax rate minus 15 per cent. So if you are on 48&half; per cent, minus 15 means you are on 33&half; per cent, but you have already paid 30 per cent on the contribution rate and then you are paying 15 per cent on the earnings. So what was actually in the fund is taxed somewhere between 15 and 30 per cent but closer to 30 per cent, then you have 33 per cent on your pension, and you are paying something up towards a 63 per cent tax rate. That is the effective tax rate that is going to apply in these circumstances&mdash;way over 48&half; per cent, the top marginal tax rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those with unfunded schemes, pensions will be reduced by this tax on retirement by the application of the 15 per cent surcharge and will then be subject to full marginal tax rate. Although the pension itself will be reduced at the outset by a process that I do not have time to go into, it will then be subject to the full marginal tax rate. But the full effect of that is that it is being taxed at way over the top marginal tax rate, at around 63 per cent. If you are going to be taxed above the marginal tax rate, where is the concessionality? Who in their right mind will take a pension? If you are going to get taxed at 63 per cent, why would you take a pension if you can avoid it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for lump sums&mdash;those in funded schemes&mdash;there will be 30 per cent tax rate on the contribution, 15 per cent on the earnings, a tax-free lump sum of up to $83,000 plus 15 per cent thereafter, which means that the tax will be at 45 per cent for amounts over $83,000. That is close to the top margin 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2629"> al tax rate&mdash;still some concessionality but not much. So people, after they get over the $83,000, will not see much value in staying in these schemes. For pensions, people will not see any value because they are going to be taxed at the full marginal rate. So why bother being in them?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We now have a situation where we have great incentives to get out of superannuation. We are seeing such articles as `Get out of super'. The message that the Institute of Chartered Accountants is having its member accountants tell their clients is that they should choose other investments over superannuation in the near future. I expect that will be a very wide reaction&mdash;which, of course, raises the question about the revenue. If they do get the money, it is much more likely that the money will come not from the high income earners it is proposed to tax but from the people who are the unintended consequences of the surcharge&mdash;the collaterally damaged lower&hyphen;middle income earners who are going to have to wear the impact through not supplying their tax file numbers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the better approach to have taken would have been to pursue what the Labor government had announced in its 1995 budget, and that was to greatly improve the equity of the tax system in the way that I mentioned earlier. That would have certainly meant that we would have had an administratively simple scheme. The government, of course, could say right now that it is going to pursue that scheme. It certainly said at the election that it would, except that it maintained the right to vary the mechanism. But in fact the government has destroyed the whole way in which that scheme could have worked by taking superannuation out of awards. So the whole process of requiring employees to make contributions cannot be maintained now because superannuation will not be an award condition in a couple of years time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, the government has in mind, in any case, using the second leg of the tax cuts not as matching co-contributions for employee contributions but by setting up some medium&hyphen;term savings vehicle which is not going to be superannuation at all. That will be less equitable, because it will be utilised mainly by 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> higher income earners who have the savings rather than by lower income earners who are unlikely to put their money into such a vehicle in very large numbers. So equity is not going to be improved by that process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the process that we have here in this legislation, we have an administrative shambles of the first order which is going to be very inequitable, largely because of the approach taken&mdash;but not just because of it. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I listened last night to the shadow Treasurer, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans), and in his typical fashion he trotted out the tired old story: it is not a surcharge; it is a tax.

This is obviously the way that the opposition is trying to object but not vote against the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> What did Labor do in their 13 years with superannuation legislation? The member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) mentioned a few things a while ago which I will come back to. What Labor did was make it more complicated by continually adding to the complexity.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KK6">Mr McDOUGALL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. I will come back to the member for Gellibrand. They are the ones who have already burdened the industry and individual superannuation contributors with legislation that I can say the majority of the legal profession in this country&mdash;who look at this in a special way&mdash;do not even know how to read.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many times I have had discussions with members of legal profession who have said, `Here are three passages. You read them, I will read them, and between us we reckon we might be able to work out what it means.' But 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2630"> at the end of the day they say, `No, it is too difficult.' That is Labor's legacy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Gellibrand referred to prior to 13 years ago and talked about the five per cent that was paid on lump sums and the benefits that accrued to people who invested in superannuation. Prior to 13 years ago, the former Liberal government offered incentives such as tax deductions for contributions made by an employee, and the member for Gellibrand referred to that as being not equitable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party comes to power 13 years ago and takes over what was a very simple and very positive system and gave people a great incentive to invest&mdash;and what do they do? They foul it up. They totally rewrite the act in a way that nobody understood, and they write it under the guise of a superannuation guarantee levy. Even they found another word for a tax: they called it a levy. But that is the part of all politicians: they will all find another word.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did they do by doing that? They destroyed what had been a very good system. I heard the member for Gellibrand comment that it really wasn't such a good system because it didn't apply to low income earners, that it only really applied to high income earners and people in government employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I went into superannuation earning $7,000 a year&mdash;I would call that a fairly low income&mdash;in 1964 as an employee in the corporate sector and I have never been out of it since. Many thousands of other people in this country also have been in superannuation systems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I acknowledge that one of the great tragedies in this country was that most superannuation in the early years was not offered to women. That was something that I certainly would not blame the Labor Party for and I don't think they would blame the Liberal Party for it. It was a problem of our society and culture of the day. That has been rectified and that is a very positive thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question we should be asking about this surcharge bill is: whom does it affect? We continue to hear all these wild stories. Whenever you cut into the hip pocket nerve, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the reaction is fierce and discussion is usually driven by emotion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I too have been listening to the financial planners who tell me the administration costs will be formidable. I have had constituents of all shades of the political spectrum tell me they will look at other ways to invest their funds. Then there are members of my electorate who are fair game to the opposition when it starts its campaign to discredit government policies. These are the people who have been led to believe this surcharge will mean they lose all or most of their savings. This could not be further from the truth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I come back to a comment made by the member for Gellibrand that 15 per cent was going to be payable by low income earners because they will not pass on their tax file numbers. All I will say to that is that members of the opposition and all members of the government through their connections with the community at all levels should be ensuring that that information is got out. It is an affront for the member for Gellibrand to infer that they will not get around to it and that it is going to be a problem. If we and the funds and the superannuation managers all do our jobs properly, it can be done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only people who will be charged this levy on their superannuation, other than those the member for Gellibrand has no confidence in, are those with an income of $70,000 and beyond. It must be clearly said and repeated that it starts at one per cent at $70,000 and does not reach 15 per cent until $85,000 and beyond. We should continue to say that. Don't just refer to it as 15 per cent from $70,000 because that is what we continue to hear and it is not accurate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also doubt if enough people realise that, for a PAYE taxpayer, this surcharge is only payable on the tax deductible component. Let's tell all the facts. Whose is the tax deductible component? If it had been prior to 13 years ago, it would have also included the employee's contribution. But the Labor Party got rid of that. Now it is on the employer's contribution, not the employee's contribution. This is the amount that the employer contributes. For the self&hyphen;employed the surcharge is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2631"> only deductible on the component of their personal contributions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard from the funds and some of the financial world that the surcharge is going to cost millions of dollars&mdash;we have heard all sorts of millions. I say to that: rubbish. No&hyphen;one is denying that it won't cost some money. But what the financial advisers and fund managers are not pointing out is that the surcharge will be collected in the same manner as that already in place for collecting their existing 15 per cent tax on superannuation funds. Some adjustment may need to take place but a mechanism is already there. All they have to do is adjust their software programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The major burden of collection falls on the Australian Taxation Office. For the financial planners, who have established wide&hyphen;ranging self&hyphen;managed fund programs, very little change needs to be made to their current administration system. Let's be honest. Have a talk to them. Ask them what has happened to the administration of their funds over the last 13 years and they will tell you very loud and clear. The many administrative charges and compliances on them are some of the reasons that the difficulties already exist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let's take a self&hyphen;employed person whom this is going to affect. The member for Gellibrand made quite great play that the person who was self&hyphen;employed and running their own managed funds through a financial adviser was going to be greatly affected. Let's take someone at 50 years of age who draws from his business $30,000 a year. I will ask anybody to deny in this place that the majority of people who are in their own business, and who operate a self&hyphen;funded system, draw much more than that&mdash;and we all know that&mdash;because they minimise legitimately and correctly what they have to pay in taxation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The same person at the end of that year throws $50,000 into their superannuation kitty, and they can do that every year. Of that $50,000, $38,000 would be a deductible contribution. If you add that $38,000 to the $30,000, you come up with $68,000. That is $2,000 under the threshold of $70,000. Where are they going to pay their one per cent up to 15 per cent on that? Let us not run away from 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the fact and deny that those sorts of schemes exist legally and exist right around this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are saying here is that the person who contributes to his or her own superannuation can take the $30,000 a year in salary, pay their income tax on that, place another $50,000 a year into the super fund, and they still pay no surcharge. It has no impact on the PAYE earner who takes home under $70,000 a year. I think we have got to keep being reminded of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand full well why the surcharge is unpalatable to many people. Any impact on earnings, savings or investment  income is uncomfortable. But, if we are asking everyone in the community to tighten their belts, to help us get out from under the crushing national debt that was left to us by the previous government, why should those who enjoy incomes over $70,000 a year be exempt from making their contribution?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those who are complaining the loudest and the longest are doing so through their financial advisers. I wonder whether some of those individuals would cry as loudly and as long if they understood the full story rather than the sanitised version that they get from their financial advisers. These advisers have let us know in no uncertain terms that they will discourage their members to continue with current superannuation and will encourage them to find alternative means of investment and tax minimisation. The member for Gellibrand made that comment. This comes as no surprise, and it should not come as any surprise. That is the business of the fund managers and the accountants. That is what they have been doing for their clients for years. That is how they earn their money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I question how many in this self-employed bracket actually meet the $70,000 level. I would say that not too many declare $70,000 a year as a cash income. I am certain that, as I said before, most have already effectively reduced their income to well below that figure. The important thing here is that, contrary to what the member for Gellibrand says, low income earners and PAYE taxpayers earning under $70,000 will not be affected. I call upon the member for Gellibrand and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2632"> all the other members in the opposition to be honest and to do their job and to ensure, through their communications, that they get people to file their tax file numbers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the last decade we have seen the widening gap between the rich and the poor in this country, mainly brought about by the last 10 years of economic management. We have seen what was once a solid middle&hyphen;class society being reduced today to the haves and the have nots. We have seen the PAYE worker pay his and her due amount of tax. As I said earlier, we have seen working women finally benefit from superannuation&mdash;a form of saving that had been denied to them for far too long.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now, to protect the workers, to protect the savings of those who cannot adopt the tax minimisation schemes, to protect those who cannot afford financial managers to establish trust funds and self&hyphen;managed funds, we are looking to build equity. Until we do this, all of Australia will continue to suffer financially and therefore socially.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not the only member of this House who has called for simplification of our superannuation system or, should I say, multitude of systems. I will continue to agitate for review and for simplification. But I believe that at this time in history we have to face the fact that we are broke&mdash;more than broke&mdash;and that we are deeply in debt. That debt has been left to us by our predecessors. However unpalatable it may seem, we must make serious inroads into that debt before we can ever hope to generate the concessions to reduce levies and charges that we would all like people to receive. Today it is a case of those who can afford to pay must pay, and that includes all members of this House and the other House.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 3 November 1996 the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Age</EMPHASIS>  carried a story with the headline `The news on super&mdash;not all bad'. I think that is at best an arguable summation of the superannuation bills before the House. While there are a number of issues in these amendments causing concern amongst superannuation fund members and institutions, superannuation remains a worthwhile investment vehicle in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That said, I, like many other members, have reservations about the new tax&mdash;and let us be frank: the government is merely dabbling in semantics in calling the impost a surcharge rather than a tax. I am concerned about the impact the additional impost may have on national savings. I am equally concerned that the tax could adversely affect people not originally intended to be caught in its web. It is questionable whether this proposed impost passes the three criteria of a good tax, that is, a tax delivering equity, efficiency and simplicity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australians are not good savers, and many tax experts fear that the additional tax on superannuation will further erode our alarmingly low level of national savings. Home ownership is still the preferred savings option of most Australians, and experts agree that superannuation will not be used more than necessary unless people are confident that governments will keep their fingers out of a very tempting cookie jar. It is likely that many Australians will be swayed to divert part of their moneys into higher risk investments as a result of this impost. The introduction of the surcharge will almost certainly see a movement of moneys away from super funds and into equities and negative gearing&mdash;this at a time when they should be encouraged to provide for themselves in their twilight years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A recent article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> reported that chartered accountants are advising up to 60 per cent of their clients to avoid this new tax by moving out of superannuation. Mr David Brown, the superannuation spokesman for the Institute of Chartered Accountants, ICA, signalled that as many as 60,000 people would be advised to consider shares, equities or negatively geared property as an alternative to superannuation. Mr Brown emphasised that this figure of 60,000 was a conservative estimate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The superannuation tax is meant to apply to only 300,000 high income earners nationwide and is reckoned to generate $500 million in additional revenue for the government. If Mr Brown's figure is accurate, then one&hyphen;fifth of those who are being targeted by the impost will tailor their investments to avoid paying 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2633"> it. The government is relying on this revenue to help balance its books in the future. Its gung&hyphen;ho attitude will certainly see a further blow&hyphen;out in the national deficit if it does not review the administration of the super tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I suggested earlier, the new impost fails all three tests of a `good', or at least a palatable, tax. Some may argue in favour of the additional tax on the grounds of equity, claiming that those who will be hit by the tax are those who can afford to pay it. This was the argument presented by the then Assistant Treasurer, Senator Short, in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 25 September 1996. He said then that in introducing the surcharge the government was acknowledging that concessional superannuation arrangements benefited higher income earners to a much great extent than lower income earners. However, the Taxation Institute of Australia, the TIA, makes the point in its submission on the super tax that the cost of collecting the impost from high income earners will be spread across all members of funds. Fund members could therefore be forgiven for feeling duped by the government, given the former Assistant Treasurer's commitment in October last year that with the introduction of the impost `there will be certainly no imposition on fund contributors'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One tax expert likened this tax slug to the introduction of the fringe benefits tax in 1986 by the then Labor government. While the FBT was sold to the Australian people as a cost to employers, it is in reality a cost on employees. In this case, the cost of the new super tax will almost certainly impact on pretty well all fund members even though it is aimed at fund managers. While the proposed tax may only apply to those with an income above prescribed levels, the cost of its collection will be borne in part by those members of a fund who are not paying and who may never be likely to pay the surcharge. There is also the potential for serious inequities between protected and private super funds under the current legislation. To date, no&hyphen;one on the government benches has explained how the government proposes to levy the super charge against a constitutionally protected fund. As the law currently stands it cannot. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> This paves the way for significant discrepancies between the treatment of protected and unprotected funds. That can hardly be described as fair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 29 September 1996 the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper suggested that `the lack of equity is the most damaging aspect of the surcharge'. But I submit that the issues of simplicity and efficiency in the collection of the surcharge are of equal importance. The Commissioner of Taxation, Mr Michael Carmody, has described the proposed method of collection of the surcharge as `an administrative nightmare'. When one considers the administration of the surcharge and the compliance costs associated with the additional 15 per cent tax rate that will be created, this description appears more than warranted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 27 September last year the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> discussed the `massive deadweight cost' that will be created through compliance with the surcharge and indicated that much of the $500 million additional revenue will be `swallowed' in compliance costs&mdash;well, if not quite swallowed perhaps more than matched by the costs of compliance. The Institute of Chartered Accountants has branded the method of collection as `extraordinarily expensive and cumbersome' and has suggested that this method is being pursued in an attempt to avoid the surcharge looking like what it really is&mdash;a tax increase.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Peter Foxten, the President of the Association of Superannuation Funds Australia, ASFA, is also critical of the proposed method of collecting the surcharge. One would have to agree that these people represent a fair cross&hyphen;section of the financial fraternity. Surely the coalition, which has made such a fanfare about its commitment to a more open, consultative and accountable government, cannot ignore those concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Several alternative methods of collecting the surcharge, including the PAYE system, have been proposed. A Queensland actuarial firm, Buck Consultants, suggested that tax deductible contributions to superannuation be reduced to produce the same net savings that the surcharge is supposed to generate. The ICA has also supported the collection of the impost on the basis that taxpayers return their 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2634"> contributions with their personal tax return, which are subject to assessment. The ICA asserts that this would be a much simpler and less costly method of recovering the surcharge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Taxation Institute of Australia proffered several methods of collecting the levy which would allow the government to achieve the same policy and revenue outcomes by other means more efficiently. One suggestion is to collect the surcharge directly from the individual member or allow the member to deduct the tax amount from his or her superannuation account on the provision of adequate documentation to the fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Mr David Connolly, a former parliamentary colleague of ours, outlined a fourth option in the November 1996 edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Personal Investment</EMPHASIS>. In his article, Mr Connolly referred to the government's promised review of the mechanism for delivering the l-a-w tax cuts as a matching contribution on the proposed compulsory superannuation contribution up to three per cent of income. He predicted that the coalition will announce in its May 1997 budget that it will not proceed with Paul Keating's policy of introducing a compulsory levy to achieve the employee contribution, after receiving advice that that may be unconstitutional.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Connolly suggested that the Howard government is likely instead to introduce a voluntary scheme which will attract a government co-contribution. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The question of how the co-contribution should be paid and to whom, has created the opportunity for the government to review the front&hyphen;end taxation of superannuation and trade off the co-payment for the 15 per cent tax on employer contributions.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr David Connolly points out that this option would be revenue neutral because the tax on the surcharge on higher incomes could continue at the present 15 per cent rate and would not need to be increased to 30 per cent as proposed. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People on incomes below $70,000 would in effect pay no tax on employer contributions, and the government could still meet its budget objective of making the superannuation tax system more equitable at no cost to revenue.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Surely it would be in everyone's interest to simplify and combine these changes.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Surely indeed. Both the Institute of Chartered Accountants and the Taxation Institute of Australia have expressed concern about the privacy issues involved with the supply of the tax file numbers&mdash;the TFNs&mdash;to trustees. In the words of the institute:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current surcharge proposal provides the potential for breaches of privacy in a number of fundamental ways . . . Privacy concerns involve an important policy decision about whether funds should be held responsible for the security of information which was once solely within the domain of the ATO/taxpayer relationship.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The general consensus among tax professionals is that they would like to see the government agree to a cooling off period until further consultation with industry occurs. By way of example, I refer to an article which appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS>  in October last year. It discussed the possibility of new self-funded retirees copping the surcharge if they choose to take a lump sum from their super, which pushes them above the $70,000 threshold for that particular year. These are not high income earners. They are people who have opted to provide for themselves in retirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is absolutely necessary that the government define clearly all the elements constituting annual income before this bill is passed by this parliament. Although the surcharge has reduced the advantages of superannuation, it remains an effective tax savings option for many. But, as the superannuation spokesman for the Institute of Chartered Accountants has made clear, the impost has `exacerbated the uncertainty in the super area . . . additionally, it will eat into the benefits provided by membership of superannuation'. Ms Susan Ryan, a former colleague, echoed this sentiment when she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would be a great irony . . . if the government allowed the garnering of additional revenue to achieve its deficit reduction target to destroy the long-term savings policy of the nation and jeopardise our retirement incomes policy.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Earlier this year, I received a facsimile from a respected actuary practising in the field in Western Australia. This professional woman advised me that her company had collected 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2635"> information on the number of changes to the rules governing superannuation since 1 July 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She observed that since July 1994 there have been legislative changes, or insurance and superannuation  commission releases, affecting the operation of superannuation funds once every 6.5 days. That actuary said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is a frightening statistic and shows the desperate need for some stability in the system.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">She suggested that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Everyone working in the industry accepts that there are aspects of the existing system which still need to be improved. This needs to be done gradually to rebuild after the uncertainty and distrust caused by this incredible pace of change.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The government has stated that this super tax will target a relatively small number of taxpayers, but many financial advisers point out that there is no longer any confidence in the community that others will not be targeted in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Only two weeks ago, the Retirement Savings Account Bill was debated in this place. The government introduced that measure to encourage domestic savings by offering a wider choice of savings options to the Australian people. A fortnight later, we are debating legislation that is likely to dissuade saving because of the uncertainty the super tax has created.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Little consideration has been given in this debate to the impact that the super tax will have on the small business sector. Chartered accountant Mr Graham Connolly, not to be confused with Mr David Connolly, argued a very good case in a letter to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 17 March this year. He questioned why small business owners were to be `penalised' by the impost when they take reduced salaries, reinvest profits and generate employment. Mr Connolly points out that it is only in their later years that these proprietors have adequate funds to set aside and provide for their retirement. These people who constitute the engine room of the Australian economy will be hard hit by the super tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Connolly's argument is supported by Hughes Fincher Services Pty Ltd, chartered 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> accountants. I received a letter from them dated 4 March. The author said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Small business will be badly affected (by the surcharge). For years small business people take big risks struggling to make reasonable incomes. When they do, those incomes are often limited to only a five to ten year period. For the few years they can contribute to superannuation in a meaningful way, they will be penalised by high taxes on that saving.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is how the small business community is to be rewarded for its efforts by a supposedly sympathetic government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another aspect of this debate that has been conspicuous by its absence. It relates to the application of the surcharge to the proceeds of the sale of a small business where the proceeds are converted into an approved superannuation fund. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will recall that that is a promise of the government, although it has not legislated to that effect yet. I do not recall anyone calling on the government to make it clear whether the impost will apply in that particular instance and, if so, the date it becomes effective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed legislation suggests that the super tax will be applied to the proceeds of the sale of a small business if it exceeds the threshold amount. No wonder the government has studiously avoided any debate about that so far. I invite the Treasurer (Mr Costello), when he responds in the second reading debate, to come clean and advise the House on the effective commencement date and whether the super tax will apply in that particular instance. In the meantime, I oppose these measures in their present form.</PARA></SPEECH>

Are you telling me they do not have the technology and the information systems to deal with this tax, that they are going to be so stingy about things that they are not even going to put in a bit extra, quite negligibly, out of their massive profits?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are funds that you have to contribute to. Wouldn't the people of Lindsay love to have that job. They would say, `You have to come and buy from me. What a great job. What a great industry. You have to pay. They've got a guaranteed source of income.' Those opposite have the gall to whinge and say, `Oh, our costs are going up. We'll have to pass them on.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I tell you that the people of Lindsay, contrary to the statements of the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), do not know a whole bunch about the share market. They do not know a whole bunch about negative gearing. They do not know a whole bunch about those complex things. This is the reason they pay a fund to do that for them. They expect certain increases, certain guarantees and a certain percentage increase in income from the funds. That is what funds are paid to do, and they do it very well.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These funds have access to the latest program on the market, Wizard, which is guaranteed to get you gains in the share market between 14 per cent and 15 per cent. Another program came on the market recently. For about $2,000 you can get gains in the share market&mdash;guarantee 14 per cent since December 1995. These funds have access to those sort of resources. They are actually, once they get these contributions, making money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Curtin is exactly right. In contributing to a fund, an 18 per cent tax haven is available, not to mention what the funds are going to earn for you. If the funds are not doing that&mdash;if they want to talk down their own product and think that they are so lousy about it&mdash;then good. The people of Lindsay will go shopping. We will find another fund. We will find someone who is going to give us that 18 per cent tax haven, and more, on our input.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you decide not to contribute to super and you pay your 48 per cent to the government and try to find a better return than 18 per cent plus on your money, I do not think you will be able to. Superannuation is still an immensely attractive option. It is still the premier option to take advantage of. A lot has been said about small business owners. To answer the member for Curtin: no, the incentive does not apply to the rollover nor to superannuation of $500,000 by small businesses. That has been made clear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only people who really seem to be affected by this are judges and politicians. And, boy, aren't they all terribly cranky on the other side. Politicians are going to be affected. The members on this side of the House are quite prepared to wear that. If the people of Lindsay have to wear it, we will. If the members of the opposition want to get up here and come out with mumbo&hyphen;jumbo and support the superannuation funds and the judges and then say, `Look at that&mdash;we benefit too,' it shows that they have no idea why they lost government on 2 March and the by&hyphen;election on 19 October. It is quite clear to me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is fair. Saving measures were implemented right around Australia in the last budget. Money was taken from all depart 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2637"> ments. That was spread right across the board evenly&mdash;child care, aged, R&amp;D, the Public Service, Medicare, you name it. In this instance, all we are asking is that the funds pay their fair share. If they want to use their clout and their lobby group and say, `We are going to make it hideously expensive and pass it on to contributors,' woe betide them. Because, if they want to talk down their own product, no one is going to lose from it except them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a lot mentioned about the constitutional challenge to the act. It is said that you cannot get the funds to pay the fund members' surcharge. The opponents to this bill are relying on section 51, subsection (xxxi) of the constitution to do that. That section  basically says that the Commonwealth may acquire:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . property on just terms from any State or person for any purpose in respect of which the Parliament has power to make laws</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They are hanging their hat on that clause, saying that, according to that clause, you are taking money away from the funds without just compensation. It is their money!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not the funds' money; it is the employers' contribution on the employees' contribution to a superannuation fund which has a responsibility to make a decent profit on those contributions so that people can rely on a lump sum or pension benefit to take them out of dependence on the government in their twilight years. The people of Lindsay do not want to be dependent on the government. We are as keen to save as the next person. We will do the right thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By 2030, we will have five million people over 60 and things will be looking pretty grim for the younger generation who will have to fund these people. Before I came to parliament, I had never been into a nursing home. All my grandparents were dead before I was five and, moving in the circles I did, which were from my own age&hyphen;group, I had not had a huge amount to do with older people. My first experience of a nursing home was an eye&hyphen;opener. You are looking at quite an expensive industry in terms of the enormous amount of care and the workers per aged person needed in these homes. Running a nursing home is a big effort and a very 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> expensive task. We are going to have fewer people wanting to work in that industry&mdash;because it is very specialised and personality specific&mdash;and a greater number of people relying on it. People are going to have to take responsibility now for their aged life and fund that themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All we are doing is encouraging that process and saying, `That is fair.' Thanks to the previous government, it is terribly complex to administer, and we should not be hampered in our wish to make these changes simply because it was already complex. The funds which are crying foul about the complexity now probably should have done so earlier. We should not be worried about making the measures we want to make because what has gone before us makes it so complex. Those complexities were already in the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are asking for a minor adjustment&mdash;the collection of tax file numbers. Again there was a big cry from the opponents of this bill, saying, `But 20 per cent of the members are lost and the fund is no longer in contact with them.' It has been estimated that there are billions of dollars swanning around unaccounted for in the slush funds of these superannuation funds. No one is making a claim on them. What happens to those funds and the interest on them? What are these fund managers doing? It is almost a genuine requirement that we say, `Collect tax file numbers. It is better for you if you collect everyone's tax file number because, the next time that tax file number comes through, that person can be found, and you will not have lost 20 per cent of your members.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also a terrific incentive now for people to give their tax file numbers to superannuation funds. If they do not, and they earn over $85,000, their employer contributions are going to be taxed at 15 per cent. They will be anyway, but if they earn less than that and do not give their tax file number over, they are going to be taxed at that rate. So there is a terrific incentive there for people who are forward thinking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think it is valid to patronise people and say, `They will not be aware of it,' `They do not know about it' and `Things will not happen.' Most people change jobs every six 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2638"> to seven years, and when they do they tend to change superannuation funds. People are aware of their superannuation funds. They are monitoring them. They are getting monthly or yearly statements from them and are keeping track of how much they are going to be worth on retirement. Everyone is aware of savings. I do not see it as being the problem. If it is, then this government will fix it. We are not inflexible on things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Curtin came up with numerous other avenues, ideas and ways for saving. But who is to say that they would not have similar problems? Who gave them the right to stand up and say absolutely that this is how it should be done? The point is that, whatever change is made, it is going to carry with it certain discomforts. It is going to step outside someone's comfort zone. If it puts someone outside their comfort zones, well, I am terribly sorry, but it is all about progress and the progress of the nation. And go forward we will.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The administrative costs should be able to be kept fairly minimal given the high technology and the software available to the funds. It is the industry that is complaining. It is the fat cats at the top who are complaining. You really do not hear the average person on the streets in Lindsay coming up and saying, `Listen, Jackie, about that superannuation bill&mdash;' It does not affect them. Yet we have seen incredible lobby power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is wrong that they should misuse their lobbying ability and come to government with such a mealy&hyphen;mouthed, stingy appeal and say that they should be exempt in some way from contributing to the almost $10 billion hole that has been left by Labor. All of us have put our hands in our pockets. It is about time that the super funds contributed as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had some advice on the constitutional challenge that is proposed. There are ways to reorganise the act, such as deleting section 34 and making various changes to the regulations of the superannuation supervisory act. That would get us around a lot of the legal technicalities that the super funds use to find a loophole to get out of their obligations. They can try to loop through loopholes as much as they like, but we will make the effort 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and we have the willpower to carry through with this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not see why the opposition are trying to score brownie points on a bill that they will be supporting. I do not see why they should still be trying to score points in that fashion. They must support it because it is fair. It is as fair as our work for the dole scheme. They came out and opposed that scheme but then realised, `Hang on a minute, the average person on the street likes it. They think it is fair.' All of a sudden we saw a backflip and they said, `We will go back and reconsider that and we will change our position to reflect something that is fair.' Again, they recognise that this is fair. They support it on one side but then flip flop to the other side. `Hang on, let us put up a weather balloon and see which way the public opinion is flowing and we will jump on that bandwagon.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We on this side of the House have a vision to get Australia out of debt, to have some solid government savings by the year 2000 and to put Australia back in the black.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last week the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) claimed credit for improvements under his government in the conduct of question time. He claimed, with complete justification, that question time was no longer the farce that it undoubtedly became under his predecessor. Although debatable, the Prime Minister also seemed to imply that what now prevails in this place is the epitome of parliamentary reform. In returning to a time honoured approach to question time prior to the aberration created by Mr Keating, I put it to the House that it hardly constitutes reform.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the only one that goes any way towards improving the relevance of members in the conduct of proceedings in this House. The wide&hyphen;ranging changes promised to achieve that end have yet to materialise. In some ways, the influence of this House on the executive has diminished. Ministers responsible for legislation rarely attend second reading debates. The responses of ministers who deign to sum up second reading debates&mdash;which are almost as rare&mdash;demonstrate that they mostly have not even monitored debate on their office television sets. To those few ministers who do not offend in the manner described, I apologise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite often, despite the presence of advisers, technical matters raised during debate, particularly in the detailed hearing stages, are either ignored completely or answered inadequately. Then there is the practice&mdash;prevalent under the previous government and almost the rule with the coalition&mdash;of a raft of government amendments to legislation already

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nor do practices which the government observes in the conduct of business before the Main Committee go any way towards bettering our relevance.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Withstanding the test of time, going back to the early 1980s, Rutherford residents within my electorate of Paterson may soon see green rather than amber or red over the need for safer local roads. Last month, I publicly announced my commitment to seek funding from the federal Minister for Transport and Regional Development, Mr John Sharp, to deliver on the long&hyphen;mooted requests by local Rutherford residents for urgent attention to be given to the intersection at Arthur Street and the New England Highway, and calling for the construction of pedestrian traffic lights. A similar traffic hazard also confronts residents and motorists at nearby Alexandra Street.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2640">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These intersections and general traffic conditions around the Rutherford area pose a stark reminder that words and more words, traffic study upon traffic study, and further community consultation can drag on for years and years, without a hole being dug or a RTA surveyor in sight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This reminder is etched in the memories of both long&hyphen;term Rutherford residents and local business people within the burgeoning Rutherford shopping precinct. The commitment and drive of Mr and Mrs Lloyd Gregory has been something to behold. They have lobbied up hill and down dale for a better and safer deal for local pedestrians and motorists for many years now. I hope to make their efforts seem worth while in the months ahead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note, too, people such as Lyndon McLeod, who runs the local family pharmacy at Rutherford, Tom and Marie Bullen of Bullens Supermarkets, Ian Turner with his newsagency, and Rotarian Arthur Dawn, who has, incidentally, just been awarded the Paul Harris Fellow Award, are just a few Rutherford residents who are keen to see the light finally for a safe intersection at Arthur Street.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To my way of thinking, Rutherford shopping centre now has the unfair distinction of being one of the largest shopping areas of its kind not to have a working set of traffic signals to help regulate traffic and better pedestrian access to shoppers. That has got to change. The situation is even more disturbing when the very popular Maitland City Bowling Club, and parents and young children and teenagers utilising the nearby neighbourhood centre and child&hyphen;care centre in Arthur Street, as well as Rutherford High School, are putting more and more pressure on the intersection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, upon the public statement last month over my commitment to concentrate on lobbying for federal funding, this pressing road issue has again been raised to the prominence it has long deserved. Indeed, I am very pleased that, on this pressing local roadworks issue, Maitland City Council, which has gained some notoriety for some of the decisions emanating from its chamber in the last year, is 100 per cent behind the Arthur Street lights option, as outlined in their 1996 traffic 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> study. Its own studies found that upwards of 155 pedestrians and cyclists per hour were crossing the highway during peak periods within the vicinity of Arthur Street.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The federal government is now awaiting the outcome of a joint Maitland City Council and state RTA study of traffic management needs of the New England Highway at Rutherford for consideration of whether additional highway upgrading could occur. Stage 1 of the traffic management plan for the New England Highway between Regent Street and Dunkley Street has been completed, but more work was considered necessary on traffic solutions for the stretch between Dunkley Street and Wollombi Road, including pedestrian lights at Arthur Street.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My fight for safer traffic conditions along the New England Highway, be it for Rutherford, Metford or East Maitland residents, will continue. My full support for a major upgrade of the Arthur Street intersection at Rutherford is part and parcel of that. A shopping precinct of this size, which underwent further expansion in 1995, needs a set of traffic signals to regulate pedestrian and vehicle traffic. That is an issue which my transport minister will be made well aware of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe there is real scope for work to take place to install a set of traffic lights, and I will be urging the minister to examine council's position and the state RTA's position on the matter. Unlike the years and years that have passed by without the former federal government or the former Labor representatives representing Rutherford residents addressing the issue or coming to any solution, I am downright determined to do the opposite and actually deliver. I have taken the case for Rutherford residents right up to the minister, and I have an inkling that he is listening to their concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The federal transport minister, Mr John Sharp, has responded to my request by confirming that he is waiting on the traffic management study from council, before committing federal dollars to any further upgrade. Arthur Street, as the main thoroughfare for the local shopping precinct, bowling club, high school and child&hyphen;care facilities at Rutherford, has been long overdue&mdash;since the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2641"> mid&hyphen;1980s&mdash;for consideration of new road works.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let's face it: name a shopping centre larger than Rutherford's that does not have effective and safe access for both motorists and pedestrians. For people like the Gregory's of Rutherford, their red&hyphen;light wait of some 15 years for a solution may soon turn green.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="2641"><TITLE>Sales Tax Relief</TITLE>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is said that if you live long enough you will see and hear everything. Even at my tender years I am getting to that point with this piece of correspondence from the office of the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp). It is a letter that has been written to Neil Hammond of Ferny Creek, Victoria concerning the fact that earlier this year Mr Hammond's house was unfortunately burnt down in the Victorian bushfires.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He wrote a letter to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) requesting some relief for the reconstruction of his house&mdash;a temporary sales tax exemption on the building materials. That letter was sent to the Prime Minister on 27 January. A response did not arrive from the Prime Minister. It was sent on to the Treasurer (Mr Costello), who in turn sent this minor request on to the Assistant Treasurer. A letter addressed to Mr Hammond came back on 7 March and I believe it deserves to be written into the full record of the parliament and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I sympathise with the situation that now faces you and your family. However, the Government receives many requests for reductions in tax burdens. To agree to individual requests would often only have a small impact on the Budget. However, if all of the requests were to be granted it would increase the budget deficit by billions of dollars. Such a blowout in the deficit would be unacceptable, as it would place pressure on interest rates to rise 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> (thereby increasing unemployment and reducing economic growth) and would reduce national savings (and could therefore further increase Australia's foreign debt). </PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">The information is of no assistance to Mr Hammond. It is a letter of a mean spirited, mealy&hyphen;mouthed government that does not have the commonsense to respond to a request for compassion in sensible terms. There is no sensible response here. It is a response of the absurd. It is theatre of the absurd to say to Mr Hammond that his minor request for a concession on sales tax to help rebuild his home that had been burnt down will blow out the budget deficit by billions of dollars, will send up interest rates, will increase unemployment, will reduce economic growth, will reduce national savings and could further increase Australia's foreign debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister at the table, the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp), should have a word with his brother about this standard of absurdity coming out of his office. I have seen some economics in my day but never the economics of chaos theory. This is like saying that if a butterfly flaps its wings in Brazil there will be an earthquake in Western Australia. It is like going back to the old domino theory used in economics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead of having the downward flow of communism into Australia, it is the downward flow of national bankruptcy: if a fellow receives a taxation concession to rebuild a house that was burnt down in a bushfire it will send the country broke. That is to say that if Mr Hammond sneezes Australia's 17 million people will catch colds. The office of the Assistant Treasurer is saying that if he builds his house one day the next day the IMF and the World Bank will be knocking on his door to blame him for national bankruptcy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a response of the absurd. If a government cannot give a serious response to a family and a citizen who has suffered under the very sad circumstances of having their

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What sort of government is so mean spirited and absurd that they cannot write back in proper terms to Mr Hammond giving him a sensible response. Instead of having Costello-omics, we have got chaos theory in the economics of government policy, we have the domino theory&mdash;that one person's small taxation concession on building materials will send the country broke&mdash;we have Mr Hammond sneezing and the nation catching colds and we have him being told that if he builds his house one day the IMF and the World Bank will knock on his door the next and say that he has sent the country broke.</PARA>

I want to raise once again an issue not only as the member for Groom but also as the patron of a local community support group for those affected by myalgic encephalomyelitis or chronic fatigue syndrome, a potentially disabling and chronic condition affecting the immune and central nervous systems. There is no known single cause, although for many it may be a viral trigger. Some patients may have a sudden onset whilst for others it may be a slow and gradual process with no easily identifiable trigger. It can vary greatly in severity and duration.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Current research suggests that a dysfunction of the immune system and the central nervous

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight in the adjournment debate to speak about the reconciliation process leading up to the Australian Reconciliation Convention, which is to be held from 26 to 28 May 1997 at the World Congress Centre in Melbourne. It is significant that this is being held some 30 years after the referendum which actually made our indigenous people proper and full citizens of this country and which addressed the outrageous racist history of this nation, which some would like to paper over.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to commend the reconciliation process tonight to all parliamentarians and, indeed, to all Australians because it is an issue which is important for all of us as a nation. It has never been more important, particularly given the climate of intolerance which has been fostered since 2 March 1996. In particular, we all sit in this chamber with the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson), who has stated that she would not represent Aboriginal Australians. That is an outrageous comment and one which I do not think would have been tolerated had she mentioned any other group other than our most oppressed group, indigenous people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The chairperson of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, Patrick Dodson, has stated that `to effect deep and lasting change in this country, reconciliation has to be a people's movement'. To this end, Australians for Reconciliation have worked hard all around 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the country with community groups and individuals at the local level. Their activities have been very much in the social justice tradition of thinking globally but acting locally. Reconciliation is a global issue. Its anti-racism message is one that must be taken seriously if we are to combat the narrow, red-necked views of the outspoken minority because it is still the case that indigenous Australians suffer from a great level of discrimination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased that the Labor Party has put as our representative on the council the member for Banks (Mr Melham), the shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs. I think that it is unfortunate that the government does not have the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) on the council. The representative of the government, the member for Aston (Mr Nugent), is no doubt someone who is committed to the improvement of the lot of Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders. It is no reflection on him whatsoever, as I am sure there are many on the other side of the House who are committed to the reconciliation process and I congratulate them for that. But, nonetheless, it sends a very bad message that the minister is not represented on the council.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, when I heard the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on radio this morning, it struck me once again that he is a very good performer on radio and knows how to address his audience, but there were two sorts of addresses to the audience. When he spoke about native title, he said, `I want to address a message directly to the farmers, and I say to you that I will represent your interests.' He spoke to them directly, but when he spoke about indigenous people, it was indirect. He was not speaking to them. There was no, `And I say to Aboriginal Australians, I actually think that I am going to uphold your rights as well.' The fact that you have a campaign from some people in this parliament to extinguish native title is an outrageous attack on all of us, and I wish those in the government who have a more progressive and enlightened view on these issues the best of luck in combating it.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2644">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the racism issue, as well tonight I wish to draw people's attention towards an ongoing community campaign against racism against indigenous Australians and, indeed, against racism wherever it exists. On 12 April there will be yet another rally in Sydney in Hyde Park against racism. It is being organised by community groups, by churches, by people who are concerned about the increasing level of intolerance. That, as part of the process of the lead-up to the reconciliation convention in May, is something that all of us should participate in in our local communities and all of us should encourage.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="2644"><TITLE>Drugs</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have received the following letter from a constituent of mine, Ms Lara Stevenson, which I would like to bring to the attention of the Australian people. It begins:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Mr Hockey,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am writing to you as a twenty year old female who is concerned with a problem in our society, which I believe has gone beyond our control. DRUG ABUSE.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have never taken much time to deal with issues such as drug and alcohol abuse because it rarely concerned myself or family and friends, and I am not a person who is out to `save the world'. I am just an ordinary girl who cannot believe how available, cheap and widely used hard drugs are becoming.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the universities and schools have been on their summer break I am finding that I cannot go out on a Saturday night without somebody telling me they are on the `best high' due to taking speed or ecstasy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When I attended high school there was always a group of people who smoked marijuana, whether it was everyday or only on weekends, I had a firm belief that they would "grow out of it" and were only experimenting. These people have now turned to hard chemicals to get a more exciting `high'. Unfortunately it is no longer a minority group taking chemicals, from what I have observed for myself `pot' is boring so everybody has now decided that ecstasy and speed are the way to go.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This habit has been justified to me by many people, I will give you some of these examples;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Cheaper than a night out drinking. ($30&hyphen;$60)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Gives you a boost of energy and therefore you can dance all night.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> You lose weight.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Admittedly twenty year olds should be old enough and responsible enough to make their own decisions, however once someone feels the first exhilarating hit from a line of speed or an `eccy', they want that feeling again and although they don't realise, they're already mildly addicted. It affects their way of thinking, and they no longer think like responsible twenty year olds. This is not hearsay, I was at a BBQ yesterday and heard one of my friends say exactly this.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I work for News Limited, and I was working on The Daily Telegraph news desk the day Anna Wood died from taking an ecstasy overdose. Believe me, it scared all of us. Many people thought that The Telegraph was making an example of Anna Wood and that it was only a good story. Yes, it was a good story, because with Anna's parents and friends, the Telegraph tried to educate people on the dangers of MDMA. I originally thought Anna's death would frighten people and deter many from taking drugs, it has done the opposite, people think they are immune to side effects and even death.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We think the drug problem is confined to Kings Cross, Oxford Street and Cabramatta but it isn't. I was at a nightclub on Sydney's North Shore on New Years Eve, when two fifteen year old girls and their friends approached me, I was their babysitter some time ago. Imagine my surprise to see these young girls in the nightclub and then telling me they were all on ecstasy and wasn't it great. They assumed that because many people in the nightclub were drinking water and dancing they must have been on drugs also.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I realise that there will always be a drug problem in our society and there is only so much a government can do. Believe me I can go out dancing and have a great time with the best of them and I love going out with my friends. But how many more deaths, brain damage, accidents and drug overdoses do we have to see before people start to realise that it could be them next?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this letter is to tell you, if you didn't already know, how severe this problem has become, and to ask you if there is a possibility of educating young people on the dangers of drug abuse. Why does education have to stop when we leave school? Most people start using hard drugs when they leave school, they're working so therefore they can afford it. I know of two people who use their AUSTUDY money to pay for drugs and alcohol, is this fair? In the end they're just hurting themselves. The television commercials for drink driving are so effective, they shock and scare people. Is this the only way to get through to our friends?  
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2645">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am prepared to help in any possible way, but there is only so much one person can do. I propose that a new drug education scheme and tougher penalties for drug pushers and users be introduced. If it means saving one persons life or another persons sanity shouldn't we do it?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to draw the attention of the House&mdash;and in particular the attention of those members opposite&mdash;to something that they are very aware of, which is the fact that our offices are being inundated by people with problems. Those Australians who thought this was going to be a government to make them comfortable and relaxed are now finding out just the opposite.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are finding out that the cutback in government services has meant staff in government departments are not <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">coping either. I just want to go through some of the examples of the kinds of problems that are coming on a regular basis. A number of people have been in tears when they have spoken to me both on the phone and at my office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The change to social security to become a more efficient system has meant that various offices have actually stopped the system of queuing by number, where they could talk to a departmental officer at a cubicle. People are now required to stand in a line and be dealt with one after the other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was speaking with a woman this week who spent 20 minutes in line. The woman is 65 years of age, with osteoporosis, but there were no chairs available so she could not sit down. And if she had sat down, she would have lost her spot in the queue anyhow. While she was in the queue she could hear the people ahead telling the officer their business. When it got to her turn, she did not want her affairs to be heard by all the people behind her, but that was what was required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My staff have now dealt with the woman in some detail. The fact is that this woman did not have a problem. Incidentally, she had already rung up earlier and tried to make an appointment. The current waiting time is three weeks. She felt that she had a problem with 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> her affairs which may have meant that she was frauding. She was extremely anxious, which was why she wanted to be able to talk to the officer face to face. When my staff then dealt with her in some depth, of course she had no problem. But now she has&mdash;because she is now very upset and very ill. And this is the kind of damage being done by those opposite who are talking about people being comfortable and relaxed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A gentleman who came into my office on Monday afternoon has two daughters are on Austudy. He has a bankrupt company, but it is a company which means he goes through the actual means test. His wife has been told by her doctor that she can no longer work on the application because her illness, induced by trying to sort out and deal with the Austudy claims, is such that she can no longer cope. So now he is doing it instead. The fact is that these people are on benefits. They have two daughters&mdash;one at university, one at school. They are uncertain. Their Austudy has currently been refused.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A young woman came in who has an income of $20,000 a year. That got converted to $116,000 a year. She had her year planned out till suddenly she was told she was not eligible for Austudy. The fact is that those who are not eligible for Austudy are eligible for social security. And what is happening? They are being forced to take it. The savings that are supposedly being made are not going to be available because it will be another part of the budget where the spending will come from. We are going to see a cut and a saving in Austudy but, equally, we are going to see an increase in the number of people on benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Turning to benefits, people put in their income declarations on a regular basis&mdash;every month, every fortnight&mdash;and it is absolutely exact, absolutely accurate. There is now a computer error. So one constituent this week now has a debt of $4,000. The department said, `Look, I'm sorry. It is our mistake, but pay up.' These are people with no money. The government will trumpet this as a saving&mdash;`Here we are. We have caught some frauds. We have saved some money.' Who 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2646"> are they saving it off? People who are impoverished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You government members all know this because I have no doubt that you are all getting the same problems and in the same volume, if not more so. Because you are in government, I do not doubt that people will be coming to you thinking you can help. I also know how powerless you are, as your constituents are finding out.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to have the opportunity of joining in the debate on the Trade Practices Amendment (Industry Access Codes) Bill 1997. This bill amends the access regime for the so&hyphen;called essential facilities. The amendments will seek to streamline the process for access undertaken by service providers, and are specifically directed towards the electricity industry. That is a point that was entirely missed by the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) when he spoke yesterday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill will promote competition in infrastructure sectors by providing very substantial benefits to consumers, businesses and the overall economy. This bill is about responsible micro&hyphen;economic reform. It is about making the Australian economy more efficient and more effective, so that it delivers even greater benefits to the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill improves on the access provisions contained in the Competition Policy Reform Act of 1995, and demonstrates our ongoing commitment to the national competition policy and our ongoing commitment, without apology, to micro&hyphen;economic reform. The bill underlines our determination to continue to cut unnecessary red tape and administrative duplication through simplifying and streamlining the procedures for improving access arrangements to essential infrastructure services in network industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Honourable members will be well aware of the election commitment given by this government to cut red tape with respect to small business. This is another indication of how we are continuing to remove unnecessary red tape, unnecessary duplication and unnecessary bureaucracy from part of the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill will help establish a national, competitive electricity market. That is very important. The Industry Commission has estimated that the annual benefits through this establishment will be in the vicinity of some $5 billion. That is $5,000 million dollars, or approximately 25 per cent of the total benefits expected from the national competition policy reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Werriwa referred to some last gasp amendments moved by the Labor Party in the Senate. The simple fact of the matter is that those amendments were to require petrol companies to allow access to terminals, but it is fairly clear that the amendments 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2648"> moved in the Senate and foreshadowed by the honourable member for Werriwa are nothing to do with this particular bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill, as I said a moment ago, is specifically directed towards the electricity industry. This government has a determination to improve competition in the petrol industry, and I will point out what the government proposes in relation to the petrol industry. Perhaps the honourable member for Werriwa and his colleagues missed the joint media release issued by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and by the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) on 11 December last year when the new approach by this government to the petrol industry was outlined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments which the Labor Party will seek to move to this bill, the amendments which they sought to move in the other place, are amendments which are nothing to do with this particular bill. It is simply using this forum, using the parliament, as an opportunity for point scoring. It is a cynical attempt to criticise this government's approach to petroleum industry reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After 13 years of Labor government, the Labor Party has nothing much to be proud of in this area. The Labor Party did nothing much in relation to the petroleum industry or, for that matter, the electricity industry. So it really was a case of crying crocodile tears for the honourable member for Werriwa to come into the Main Committee yesterday and tell us that he is going to move amendments to this bill&mdash;amendments which are nothing to do with this bill at all. It is obvious that the 13 years of Labor neglect with respect to the petroleum industry have adversely impacted on the situation in rural and regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a very effective regional and rural member yourself, Mr Deputy Speaker, you would be well aware of the need for the government's policies and changes with respect to the petroleum industry to be implemented as soon as possible. But we find that it is very much as though the Labor Party these days has had a latter&hyphen;day conversion on the road to Damascus, and that its members have gone from being tariff slashers in the former government to now being, in this parliament, proponents of tariff maintenance. The Labor Party has no policy consistency, I suppose one could say.</PARA>

While I have the attention of the member for Fisher and the other members present, I point out that there seems to be an increasing tendency among members to try and speak about anything when debating a bill. This bill is to do with reforms to electricity, as you will see 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2649"> if you look at the bill and the second reading speech, and so I direct the attention of all members to the need to refer to, and speak about, the bill we are considering.</PARA></TALK.START>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0V5">Mr SLIPPER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, thank you very much for highlighting the point that I have been making. The only reason I was referring to the petroleum industry was that just about the whole of the speech of the honourable member for Werriwa referred to proposed amendments which he will be moving to the bill, in effect to extend the terms of the bill beyond the electricity industry and, indeed, to the petroleum industry. So I am sure that in those circumstances I am in order in referring to the speech by the honourable member for Werriwa, because he is saying that he is going to be moving petroleum industry amendments to the bill currently before the committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="10000">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Fisher and I advise him and the committee that we have not yet seen those amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0V5">Mr SLIPPER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They were, I understand, moved as last&hyphen;gasp amendments in the Senate. But certainly in this place, Mr Deputy Speaker, you are entirely right. They have not yet been moved, but the honourable member for Werriwa has foreshadowed his intention to do so. In doing so, though, he is suggesting that the Howard government is not interested in petroleum industry reform. He is suggesting that the Howard government is somehow welshing on its responsibility to bring about equity in the petroleum industry. As you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, nothing could be further from the truth. I mentioned a few minutes ago the joint media release issued by the Treasurer and by the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism on 11 December 1996, when it was pointed out that the government would:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . implement new measures in 1997 to promote increased competition and benefits to consumers in the petrol industry.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The joint statement went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In responding to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission Petroleum Products Declaration report, the Government announced that petroleum products would be removed from prices surveillance in 1997, once the Treasurer is satisfied of pro&hyphen;competitive developments in the market. One of the measures required to put this in place will be commitments from the oil majors to allow open terminal access and price transparency for the purchase of petrol by distributors and retailers.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The amendments which are going to be moved by the honourable member for Werriwa in fact refer to access to petroleum terminals. So I suggest that the honourable member for Werriwa should go off and have a cold shower. He should realise that the government has reform of the petrol industry firmly in its sights. We have a statement made by two of our most senior ministers confirming that we are committed to delivering major reforms in the petroleum sector, consistent with our election commitment. The ministers have also pointed out that progress has been made towards this end, and that the government moves to implement deregulation `will promote greater competition which will lower prices over time.' So, after 13 years of inactivity, we find that, belatedly, the Labor Party has moved amendments in the Senate and will, in this place, move amendments to this bill, amendments which are entirely irrelevant, amendments which miss the point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is about improving access to essential facilities such as electricity grids. It is a reaffirmation of our determination to have responsible micro&hyphen;economic reform in Australia. The bill will promote competition and we make no apology for that. It is interesting that the Labor Party is not actually opposing this bill but what it intends to do is to seek to expand the ambit of the bill beyond the electricity industry, to which it is specifically addressed, so that the petroleum industry can be included.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2650">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be more orderly for the Labor Party to wait for the reforms of the government to be implemented. The government's proposed reforms to the petroleum industry have received widespread support in the Australian community and I think it will be much better for the Labor Party to defer its comments on the petroleum industry until such time as the government continues to proceed with its reforms concerning that industry. I commend the bill to the committee.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Trade Practices Amendment (Industry Access Codes) Bill 1997 is designed to streamline the formal procedures for granting access to third parties to infrastructure facilities and networks of national significance by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. The bill proposes to amend the Trade Practices Act 1974 to incorporate a general industry access code approval process as a basis for access undertakings in network industries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the current legislation, the ACCC has to conduct both a public consultation process for the industry code and separate public consultation for each access undertaking made by a service provider. It is considered that that is an unnecessary duplication of effort for the ACCC and for relevant stakeholders and could lead to difficulties for the ACCC in assessing whether separate access undertakings will achieve single coherent industry wide access arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation incorporates legislation which was considered by Labor in government and I think accepted by Labor in government but was not announced. The proposals improve the efficiency of the access regime approval process, we believe, without diminishing consumer or service provider protection. On that basis, it is supported by the opposition. It ought to be able to simplify and streamline the procedures for approving access arrangements to infrastructure services in network industries and build on the access regime established by the former government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under these arrangements, third parties can seek access to services provided by essential infrastructure facilities of national significance. In network industries, such as electricity, the emerging pattern is for an industry code to be developed governing access arrangements which form the basis of undertakings to the ACCC by individual service providers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This morning, I want to call for this industry access code to go further and cover the petroleum industry. The reason I do so is that the petroleum and electricity industries in Australia have been remarkably similar in their structure and performance&mdash;that is, an homogenous product within a vertically integrated industry with natural oligopoly features at the point of production. Their only substantial difference has been that we had public ownership of electricity and private ownership of petroleum products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At a time when, under the banner of Hilmer and competition policy, state governments are vertically separating their electricity operations&mdash;generation, distribution and retail&mdash;why should petrol be any different? At a time when houses with solar energy units can join the national electricity grid, why should service stations not be able to buy their product from the most competitive source? Why should the Hilmer principles governing vertical industry separation and open access regimes not be applied to Australia's petroleum industry?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My colleague the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) has set out how this could happen. He said that a starting point would be to declare petrol refineries and terminals as an essential facility under the access regime. The terms and conditions of access would then be administered by the ACCC. The parliament has delegated authority for these declarations to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2651"> the relevant minister, now the Treasurer (Mr Costello), following a process of third party applications and National Competition Council assessment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of petrol, it would not be inappropriate for the parliament to make its own declaration, just as in the 1995 Competition Policy Reform Act it determined to exempt coal rail transport for a period of five years. Declaration under the access regime would represent the first and most significant step towards the vertical separation of Australia's petroleum industry. It should ensure open access to terminals on reasonable terms and conditions. Other aspects of vertical separation should logically follow, based on the competition principle that an access regime should involve more than a company simply providing downstream access to one of its own subsidiaries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Importantly, I would argue that petrol meets the three criteria set out for declaration in the ACCC's access regime guidelines in November 1995. They are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. natural monopoly, duopoly or oligopoly characteristics such that, due to economies of scale, it would be uneconomic to develop another facility.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. access to the facility services is a prerequisite for businesses to be able to compete effectively in markets upstream or downstream of the facility.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. a facility of national significance, with regard to its importance to international and interstate trade.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The member for Werriwa has pointed out that an access regime for petrol will become increasingly important as the industry continues to seek greater economies of scale.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Each of the oil majors argues that the petrol industry in Australia is overcapitalised at both the wholesale and retail level. In its submission to the ACCC, for instance, Ampol argued that the industry should down&hyphen;scale. It talked about 30 per cent fewer service stations, no more than 300 depots nationally, no more than three or four refineries, greater use of pipelines to distribute petrol between capital cities and major centres, and one shared seaboard terminal in each out port. If you look at that situation, it would seem to me that this strengthens the case for it being covered by the kind of industry access code to which we are referring this morning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to point out to the parliament that the Shell National Action Group has expressed concern about the direction in which petroleum retailing is going. It has written to Professor Fels as Chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and referred to a transcript of a radio interview between Professor Fels and Neil Robins on 24 February when Professor Fels was asked whether he thought that elimination of what are referred to as the `Sites Act' and the `Franchise Act' would strengthen the oil companies' position to control retail and wholesale prices. In the transcript, Professor Fels said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have doubts whether the two bits of legislation you're talking about&mdash;the sites act and the franchise act&mdash;are really doing that much good at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We think this is a bit of regulation that hasn't really served a useful purpose. That doesn't mean we aren't concerned about Shell's move to have multi&hyphen;site franchising, but I do think it's unlikely that oil companies would try to take over and run every service station in town if the sites act left.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Shell National Action Group indicated to Professor Fels that they differed with him on most of the points he had raised and expressed concern that, after the abundant industry information that they have tabled before the ACCC, he should take such a position. They go on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The PRMF and the PRMS Acts&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">the sites act and the franchise act&mdash;</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2652">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. The Shell National Action Group has indicated to Professor Fels that they feel:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the remedy is not to repeal this act, but to strengthen and re&hyphen;mould it to incorporate modern terminology to prevent oil companies circumventing the original intention of this act. . . that is, to prevent oil companies from controlling more than a small percentage of their total sites, and thus controlling the retail price, as they currently have the ability to do with multi site franchising to the detriment of competition.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As franchisees, they have expressed concern about:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the lack of protection afforded to us through the Trade Practices Act due to numerous constraints such as the cost of funding actions, the complexity of federal actions, the lengthy duration of any challenge and time consciousness of the system. The oil companies are well aware of this and it is only of recent times of agitation within this industry that a number of different branded franchisees have joined together to collectively take actions against their franchisors.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They go on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The franchisees and the motoring public need these Acts in place. Without them the oil companies will control every franchised retail petrol outlet in Australia, as Shell have publicly stated, as their determined goal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The oil companies are desperately attempting to have these Acts repealed. . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">and that repeal of the acts</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . gives them more control and unshackles them from the very constraints which are currently protecting both franchisees and the public. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2653">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is why I would express the view that there is a need for the industry access codes to be widened in the way proposed by the member for Werriwa.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The letter then goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The true fix for this industry is not in repealing those Acts but in allowing all franchisees to play on a level playing field. If we could all have the ability to purchase fuel under the same conditions as Woolworths, that is up to 9 cents per litre cheaper than they are forced to purchase from our franchisors locked high prices. . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Indeed, it is my concern that if the view taken by Professor Fels were to be followed then in many towns and cities there would be a Coles at one end, a Woolworths at the other and nothing in between&mdash;no newsagent, no service stations, no local baker, no pharmacist, no banks, no post office, and no motor mechanic. There would be just a Coles at one end and a Woolworths at the other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a situation where downstream access is essential to fair competition in this area. We have Woolworths presently establishing itself as another vertically integrated major with access to cheap wholesale petrol and it is establishing horizontal alliances with other majors. Unless branded and franchised stations can also access cheaper petrol then they face closure at the hands of Woolworths. By making competitive petrol access a legal right, small petrol retailers would not need the resources enjoyed by Woolworths, rather, existing service stations in country towns, for example, would have the same terminal access rights as any new competitor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not just an issue for consumers, the other part of this issue is the treatment of franchisees. I have had quite a lot of correspondence about Shell's treatment of franchisees. For example, one letter I had referred to Shell's `corporate thuggery towards its single site franchisees'. Another letter pointed out that under the multi&hyphen;site franchise system, any individual dealer who wanted to become part of this system with, for example, `between 15 and 35 sites would need capital of between $450,000 to $1,050,000 just to pay for each site's franchise fee'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at store stock levels&mdash;a realistic average of, say, $35,000 per site&mdash;then they would need another half a million dollars for 15 sites and a further million dollars for 35 sites. Fuel stock would be another $900,000 to $2 million. So for a 15&hyphen;site franchise, a person in that situation would need to raise over $1.8 million, and for 35 sites the figure explodes to over $4 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, in those circumstances, it seems impossible to imagine that a multi&hyphen;site operator could function without Shell's active participation through a bank guarantee, and the only conclusion that the authors of this letter draw is that there is a strong relationship between the multi&hyphen;site franchisees and Shell and that, furthermore, 80 per cent of Shell's revenue and sales is controlled by a small number of dealers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have had information supplied to me by Charles Power of Holding Redlich concerning the operation of the Petroleum Retail Marketing Franchise Act which does provide certain basic protection of tenure for lessee service station operators and requires disclosure of relevant information by oil companies to prospective franchisees. But it does not apply to commission agents or distributors, nor to resellers who occupy their own premises, and oil companies typically require service station dealers to operate as commission agents in respect of sale of fuel and, thereby, put such franchisees outside the protections of the Petroleum Retail 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2654"> Marketing Franchise Act. So, the end result of this is that franchisees are greatly disadvantaged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, here is a case that was brought to my attention. Back in 1980, Mario and Robyn Suprano accepted Shell's offer to operate Shell Wallsend in the Newcastle area as a self&hyphen;serve commission agency in return for which Shell would upgrade the site. In mid&hyphen;1989, the Supranos who were dissatisfied with waiting for Shell to upgrade the site, said that unless Shell gave assurances that Shell Wallsend would be refurbished in the near future, they would pull out of the site.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In October 1989, Shell showed them plans to refurbish the site. They were to become Shell Force franchisees and were promised 10&hyphen;year tenure in two five&hyphen;year terms. So, they stayed there. But Shell departed from its representations regarding 10 years tenure some three years into its term of franchise. In September of 1990, four weeks before the re&hyphen;opening of the refurbished Shell Wallsend, the Supranos were told by Shell that they would be commission agents, not dealer franchisees, putting them outside the protection of the franchisees act. They still signed an agreement which gave them 10 years tenure in three terms of three, three and four years. Shell said that they would only refuse to renew the agreement if the Supranos were consistently in breach of it, which they had never been.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In July 1993, Mr Suprano sought to renew the agreement for the second term, more than two months before his first term was up. But Shell did not respond until nearly 18 months later when they informed the Supranos that they were not prepared to renew because they had not provided written notice of their desire for a further term. Absolutely extraordinary! The Supranos ended up being forced to sign, agreeing to a 12&hyphen;month extension of the agreement and only in line with Shell's current policy. That is to say, there was no guaranteed tenure because their livelihood depended entirely on their being allowed to continue to trade at Wallsend. Furthermore, in March of 1993, Shell reduced the commission paid for sales downwards. These commission and royalty payment arrangements are extraordinary. An increase in litres sold, as a result of franchisees' efforts can, in fact, put franchisees in a worse financial position than those achieving lesser sales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other franchisees have also experienced similar treatment. Charlie Qasabian and Simon Totonjian have a Shell service station at Doyalson and the Greta Roadhouse on the New England Highway. After getting a letter confirming 10 years at the Greta site, they entered into a $90,000 loan to purchase the business from Shell. They spent $250,000 endeavouring to turn the site into a profitable business, but Shell refused to renew the lease after its expiry on 30 June 1996 and offered them far less than appropriate compensation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what we have are situations highlighting the inequality of bargaining power between service station operators and petrol companies. If there is any dispute the petrol companies simply cut off supply. As a result, there is a need for better legislation to protect both consumers and franchisees. That is why I support the remarks made by the member for Werriwa concerning the need to expand this area of the Trade Practices Act and the operation of industry access codes.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right, they knew I was speaking, as the member for Fowler says. This trade practices legislation is fundamentally about competition, which the member for Werriwa would be very keen about. The Productivity Commission's stocktake of micro&hyphen;economic reform had this to say about competition:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Getting more competition across the economy is now seen as a key to better performance. It provides a powerful stimulus for private and public firms to operate efficiently and respond to what consumers want.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It encourages firms to search continuously for improvements in the way they operate, and is therefore vital to the process of productivity improvement through time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Competition is also central to ensuring productivity gains are shared with the wider community through lower prices.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I entirely endorse those sentiments of the Productivity Commission. Regulation and monopoly and protection all encourage inefficiency and a misallocation of resources. Competition promotes efficiency and continuous improvement leading to consumer choice, better quality and lower prices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most Australians are familiar with the benefits of competition in the sporting field. As Australia is a great sporting nation, it is appropriate that the Australian economy should be based on the principle that all sectors are exposed to the rigours of competing with each other and with the world's best.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The sporting analogy helps us to understand the nature of competition&mdash;the way the competition encourages improvement, the way fair competition helps us to understand and respect the verdict of the umpire, and the way competition encourages cooperation between team members. The two concepts are not in conflict, as some people would claim. Nothing could be more removed from the Australian psyche than a desire to escape or avoid healthy competition. The most significant reform for the Australian economy over the past 15 years has been those reforms which injected greater competition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Two fundamental reforms stand out: the lowering of protection which exposed Australian firms to greater international competition&mdash;I note that the member for Werriwa has been supportive of the general move by the former Labor government to a lower protection regime&mdash;and the injection of competition into a number of the sectors of the domestic economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Examples of this include the ending of the two&hyphen;airline policy&mdash;all members would be aware of the improvement under the newer regime&mdash;the entrance of competition in the international, STD and mobile phone markets through Optus and Vodafone, the reduction in Australia Post's monopoly position, and state government moves to open up the electricity market to greater competition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have had personal exposure to Australia Post's operation, and I say that they have become very competitive, both on an Australian market position and in comparison with other nations. I think that is because they have been open to genuine competition in some sectors of their markets whilst they do maintain a monopoly of the standard letter rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is part of a next step to a policy reform process. The Hilmer competition reforms are also known as the national competition policy and it dates back to the special Premiers conference in 1991. Until then the focus of micro&hyphen;economic reform was on individual industries, for instance, the aviation industry, the automobile industry&mdash;which is now a focus 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2656"> in the current debate&mdash;the textiles, clothing and footwear industry, postal services, which have been the subject of a number of government inquiries, Telecom and higher education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The national competition policy, flowing from the Hilmer report, is by contrast a national cross&hyphen;industry initiative. Broadly, the policy requires governments to undertake the following initiatives: structural reform of their public monopolies; ensuring competitive neutrality&mdash;a level playing field is a term that a lot of people like to use&mdash;between the public and private sectors where they compete; conducting a review of all legislation which may limit competition; and ensuring access to essential infrastructure services for third parties. It is this final element which is dealt with by this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the Hilmer reforms, governments are required to look at the public businesses which have been traditionally regarded as natural monopolies. These industries, such as rail, electricity, postal and telephone services, have been traditionally regarded as services which only the government can provide. There can only be one rail network, one set of electricity wires and one set of telegraph poles. However, in the last few years we have come to question whether all these services really need to be monopolies and whether government really needs to be the provider.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the competition policy, governments are asked to look at the possibility of separating aspects of these businesses which are natural monopolies and those which are potentially competitive. For example, railways have traditionally been regarded as being the domain of governments because of their natural monopoly characteristics. In other words, it is uneconomic to duplicate rail networks, and thus competition between rail tracks would be wasteful and costly. However, rolling stock, passenger and freight services are potentially competitive. Just as private cars, trucks and buses drive on public roads, there is no reason why private operators cannot use public rail tracks and compete vigorously with one another.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By doing this, the natural monopolies&mdash;the roads, rail tracks, telephone wires or electricity poles&mdash;stay in government hands, but the private sector is allowed to offer services in the area where competition is possible. The greater the competition, the greater the incentive to raise quality, lower prices and give consumers choice. Competition between the STD telephone companies Telstra and Optus has had this result. Optus makes use of the Telstra network, just as different truck operators make use of the Hume Highway. This is the nature of what is called third&hyphen;party access under the national competition policy. The bill before the House helps to streamline the mechanisms by which access can be negotiated and the terms and conditions of access to essential infrastructure like telephone networks, rail tracks and gas pipelines might be determined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is pleasing to bring to the committee's attention that the electorate of Corangamite has been among the pioneers of private sector access to public rail facilities. In my electorate, West Coast Rail is among the first ever private passenger rail operator in Australia's recent history. The company negotiated access to the track between Melbourne and Warrnambool and runs a private service which was once run by the government owned V&hyphen;Line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">West Coast Rail now provides the only service from Warrnambool to Geelong, with three trains per day each way, and competes directly with V&hyphen;Line on the Geelong to Melbourne route. We have a situation where this privatised service has integrated into the V&hyphen;Line network throughout Victoria. So on the one hand we see the public monopoly position operating, but with the new West Coast Rail service providing a service efficiently and effectively, and saving the government some $5 million.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2657">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Victorian government was actually going to close that line. Now West Coast Rail has provided the service to the electorates of Corangamite and Warrnambool and provided a new concept of the way in which a private operator, owning its own rolling stock, might operate on the publicly owned track. We also see that TNT and the Specialised Container Transport Company are competing with National Rail on the standard gauge between Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth, which incidentally runs through the electorate of Corangamite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> foreshadowed the possibility of the stevedoring firm Patrick's also becoming involved in rail freight operations on this route, which I commend as a desirable possibility. The Commonwealth's share of National Rail is set to be privatised, along with the passenger service of Australian National and its freight arms in Tasmania and South Australia. But the standard gauge rail itself will stay in government hands and will be run by Track Australia, a specialist track management agency. This is a clear example of the separation of the functions which is possible, even under the traditional natural monopolies, under the Hilmer competition reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill deals with the rules about determining the terms and conditions of access to essential services, such as, the rail networks, electricity grids and gas pipelines where access is now being seen as an important prerequisite for real competition and, ultimately, lower prices. Under Part 3A of the Trade Practices Act, the relevant minister may declare certain essential infrastructure. This would require the infrastructure to be offered to those third&hyphen;party users, potential competitors, under certain terms and conditions. Alternatively, the owners of this infrastructure, usually the government agencies, may offer access undertaking which would set out the terms and conditions under which it would offer infrastructure access to new players. The undertaking would set out all the terms and conditions that any new player would need to meet to be granted access. This undertaking would be submitted to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. The ACCC would advertise the offer, take submissions from interested parties, and undertake public consultations on the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, there would be industries where the access undertakings would be best done on a national scale. Instead of negotiating a series of different, independent access undertakings each with its own period of public consultations and submissions, it would be possible to have a national overall industry access code. This bill will facilitate that administrative change. The ACCC will be able to conduct public inquiries and take submissions on a national industry access code without going through the wasteful process of conducting a number of individual inquiries, consultations, and submissions from the public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The glaring example of where this approach is required is in the electricity market. Part of the national policy agreed to by the Commonwealth and the states requires the creation of a national market in electricity. The national market will soon commence involving New South Wales, the ACT and Victoria.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there is to be a national electricity market then access to electricity grids in each state should be determined by a national industry access code, not a series of individual access agreements as submitted to the ACCC. The latter would be an excessively cumbersome approach. Thus, this bill will be of vital importance in setting the arrangements for the national 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2658"> electricity market. The national market will provide consumers in different states with unprecedented choice in where they source their power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once again, Victoria has led the way in this reform by splitting up the old SEC into an electricity grid which remains in public hands. There are six electricity distributors, all now operating as private companies, such as Powercor, United Energy, Solaris, and Citipower. There are also a number of separate and largely privately owned electricity generators, such as Yallourn, Loy Yang A and Loy Yang B, all of which can compete to supply electricity along the government&hyphen;owned grid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, if the private sector operators are to compete with the public sector on public&hyphen;owned infrastructure, then we need a competitive neutrality. Competitive neutrality really means a level playing field between the public and private sectors. Often, government business enterprises enjoy some unnatural advantages over their private sector competitors. Many have traditionally been exempt from sales tax and other government charges. Others have had the benefit of government guarantees over their borrowings. State and federal governments are now being asked to neutralise these advantages so that public and private sectors can compete on an equal footing. The Victorian government has moved to impose debt guarantee charges on major government enterprises to remove any advantage they may have from the government guarantee over their debts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another aspect of the competition policy is the requirement of conducting a legislative review. State and federal governments are supposed to look at any rules and regulations on the statute books which restrict competition. The governments must identify anti&hyphen;competitive laws and determine whether those laws can be justified in the public interest. The public interest should include a broad range of factors, such as, the social welfare, ecologically sustainable development, regional development and occupational health and safety. Thus, even the Hilmer reforms recognise that unfettered competition may not always maximise the broad community welfare in all cases, although there is concern that governments are exempting certain industries from the Hilmer reforms even before they conduct the relevant reviews of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The National Competition Council, set up to advise the government on the progress of the competition policy, has already expressed doubts about decisions made by some governments. It has questioned the New South Wales government's decision to retain the existing arrangements for rice marketing. The honourable member for Werriwa and I would have some concerns about the monopoly position of that particular organisation; I have challenged it in the past. It has also questioned the ACT's shopping hour restrictions. These restrictions are the complete opposite of the Victorian government's decision to allow 24&hyphen;hour trading, thus liberalising the market and removing several anomalies under prior restrictions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the Commonwealth level, there are a number of industries which have also been exempted. The Wheat Board's single desk export monopoly is something that there is a considerable amount of debate on, on our side of politics, but in the broad thrust of discussions I think that, over the next 20 years, that monopoly position will certainly be questioned. The regional monopoly of local newsagents and the restrictions of home delivery of newspapers may be exempted from the scrutiny of the Trade Practices Act. Again, that is another quite interesting argument as to the monopoly of the newsagents that has been maintained after a considerable amount of debate on both sides of the parliament.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2659">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the government needs to be vigilant about encouraging competition in all aspects. I notice that the honourable member for Werriwa is very keen on encouraging genuine competition between the oil companies and making sure that there is a fair and level playing field between the big majors and another couple of new entrants. I share some of those sentiments with him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude by referring again to West Coast Rail. That concept of running a privatised rail in Victoria is leading the way and other state governments might follow the example and integrate, in a sensible and practical way, the operation of a private company using rail track&mdash;either government owned rolling stock or their own rolling stock&mdash;and develop an integrated service within the total passenger service of the states or the Commonwealth. Then, over time, we can move away from this so&hyphen;called natural monopoly of railways which has been the mind&hyphen;set of governments and, I think, of the Australian people since Federation. So I commend West Coast Rail on its very good performance over the last three years in providing a service and, more importantly, providing an idea and a concept that the Commonwealth can follow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recognise the one&hyphen;track initiative of the previous Labor government in standardising the gauge throughout Australia and putting forward the concept that access to the standard gauge would then be available to private sector operators. It was a step in the right direction. I am very confident that the new Howard government will follow on and make more accessible the whole idea of using the national standard gauge, like the national highway system, for access by private operators. In that way, the rail systems in Australia will become more competitive, more efficient and provide better transport for very heavy agricultural goods to the seaports.</PARA></SPEECH>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2660">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Tax Law Improvement Bill 1996 reflects the second tranche of the complete rewrite of the income tax legislation embarked upon by Labor through the tax law improvement project in 1994. On Monday, I am pleased to note, the Senate passed the first package of three bills that commence the rewrite. Labor supports this legislation as it is essential that the large and complex income tax legislation laws must be simplified, hopefully to reduce compliance costs for both taxpayers and the tax office, and to take the opportunity to improve certainty in cases where there is currently a great deal of tax law uncertainty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This whole process is necessary because the old legislation, the 1936 parent act, has been amended and expanded so often that it has lost an overall coherent structure. Because of the sheer enormity of the task, the rewrite has to occur in tranches. This ongoing rewrite process, piece by piece, provides its own challenges as it is not possible to repeal the entirety of the 1936 act and replace it in total. Labor does not criticise this process. Naturally enough, we understand it is the only realistic option.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, this process has produced some disquiet in some sections of the industry. There is a variety of opinions. Some believe that there should be absolutely no policy changes at all in the rewrite. For example, Price Waterhouse, as reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> in October last year, argues that the resources of the tax law improvement program should be redirected towards a tax reform task force&mdash;that is, change policy first and then rewrite the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, Labor favours the current process which we instigated when in government. The Assistant Treasurer has the authority to make some small limited changes, especially to clarify the tax laws. However, this process should not be used to significantly alter policy more or less through the backdoor. Labor initially understood that the government agreed with this policy neutral project. However, this legislation, as introduced to the parliament, goes beyond a simple and neutral rewrite role.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This particular tranche is being rewritten to address matters concerning assessable and exempt income, deductions, trading stock, depreciation and gifts. The more specialised areas include entertainment expenses and primary production. As with earlier bills, this bill was sent to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts for consideration. The committee's report on the legislation, No. 348, was tabled in the House on 6 March. I am pleased to see in the chamber the chair of that committee, Mr Somlyay. I pay tribute to the work of his committee in the rewrite project because, in the parliamentary scrutiny, the rewrite brings forth a whole range of very complex and detailed matters in our taxation laws. To have a joint committee that so capably gets across all the detail and complexity, and provides due parliamentary scrutiny to the project, is absolutely critical.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From time to time, there is too little public appreciation of the active role of committees such as the Joint Committee of Public Accounts in that parliamentary scrutiny. It is a very good thing that we have a committee that is well&hyphen;led, well-resourced, and very active in making sure that the work of the tax officials in the rewrite project, and the involvement of the private sector, receives due parliamentary scrutiny. I pay tribute to the work and the report of the joint committee in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also endorse the way in which the committee appreciates that the best type of rewrite is a policy neutral rewrite. I note its concerns about the significant policy changes proposed within the bill. In particular, a concern arises about the proposed alteration of the depreciation provisions concerning hire purchase transactions, and the proposed alterations to the trading 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2661"> stock provisions where assets change their character from normal business assets into trading stock, and vice versa.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also a large number of minor technical amendments to ensure that the bill accurately reflects the existing law. Accordingly, the government has circulated numerous amendments; 83 in total. The opposition will not oppose any of these amendments. However, while being supportive of the project, we are concerned about the volume of amendments being presented to the parliament, and I am sure that that concern is supported by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and its chairperson. Perhaps part of the problem relates to the resourcing of the tax law improvement program. A vacancy has existed in one of the two private sector positions within the program since December 1995, 18 months ago&mdash;a vacancy for private sector resources to the program&mdash;and I note that the joint parliamentary committee has expressed concern about this delay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The joint committee has also suggested that additional resources be made available for the hiring, on a short&hyphen;term basis, of private sector experts in particular areas to supplement the general program team. Labor supports this recommendation wholeheartedly. I note with concern, however, the cost to the public interest of the inadequate resourcing of a core government function&mdash;that of the major revenue authority, the Tax Office&mdash;and of private sector resources being harnessed for this particular program. I urge the government to take corrective action as soon as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an important point that too often in the public commentary, and too often under this government's budget management, it is assumed that every single budget cut and every single reduction in public resourcing is a good thing. But, clearly, the private sector can suffer much greater costs than the small public costs that are being saved. The cost to the private sector&mdash;to the accountancy and tax law industries and the small business sector, in particular&mdash;of delaying this tax improvement project is immense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the government not to have filled a vacancy for some 18 months in the private sector resources that can be harnessed for the project really is an opportunity cost of folly. It is far better to resource this program fully, get the rewrite happening as fast as possible, have it approved by the parliament under the scrutiny of the joint committee, and allow certainty and simplicity to take hold in the tax law industry around Australia and in the understanding of those laws by private citizens and the private sector, particularly small businesses. The government needs to act on the recommendations of the joint committee to give this rewrite process full and adequate public sector resourcing. Other than making those comments, I will say that Labor will be supporting this bill and the circulated amendments, and we look forward to the further success of the rewrite program.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a few observations, especially after reading the second reading speech by the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles), in which he said that the 1936 act was `on the verge of collapsing under the weight of 60 years of constant and largely piecemeal amendment.' I have spoken to accountants about the income tax act, and they all say the same thing: it has become so heavy to lift that some of the staff are looking at putting in claims for back problems. It is about time it was reviewed and rewritten to make the act shorter, easier to understand, and with as few loopholes as possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to pay tribute, as the former speaker did, to Mr Somlyay, who was here beside me today as Chairman of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. I am advised that both New 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2662"> Zealand and Britain have a strong interest in looking at this project and undertaking to look at what they can do to amend their tax laws in line with the changes that we are proposing to make. That is a great tribute to Mr Somlyay and his committee, who have reviewed the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rewritten areas that, in particular, I want to talk about are the areas that cover expenses, primary production deductions, the recoupment of deductible expenses and the sale of leased cars. I am advised by the accountants that I have spoken to about these issues that these are the issues that are most open to debate. As a result of that, of course, it costs the taxpayer money to have the matters resolved and costs the taxation department time, effort and money in trying to determine who is right and who is not right and in trying to interpret the intention of the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to mention five points in particular. They are minor policy changes and I note that these changes have the support of the opposition. The five specific points that will make it easier, simpler and less burdensome for the taxpayer are: replacing the rules with which one facilitates taxpayer compliance; simplifying the rules which are unnecessarily complex; deleting unnecessary rules; removing anomalies; and clarifying ambiguities. Anyone who has anything to do with the income tax act will be very pleased that these changes will occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only other thing I would like to mention is that this will have no impact on revenue. It is basically a broadly neutral impact on revenue. It is about time that this has been tackled and, as I said, I want to pay tribute to Mr Somlyay and his committee for reviewing the changes and for making this possible. It will, in time, save us all a lot of time, money and effort and the taxpayers of Australia will be very pleased with these changes, not to mention the accountants, and those who go to them to seek advice and to understand the interpretations of the act, which have become very complex.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know in one particular case&mdash;my own case&mdash;I have sought a clarification from the Australian Taxation Office on matters that my accountant and I would like to dispute, and we have asked them for an interpretation of the act. We chose not to put in my tax return and to say that we have taken the deductions. If the ATO disagrees, they should advise us accordingly. We have decided that the best thing we can do is to ask for a clarification of the matters and then we will put in an amended return. It has now been close enough to six months and we still have not had a response from the Australian Taxation Office. I can understand the difficulty of the complexity in which they find themselves, trying to interpret something that should have been cleared up a long time ago. I fully support the bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is nothing new about calls for a substantial overhaul of our surfeit of tax legislation. What is different is that this message is now being driven, not only by industry and employer groups which have long championed tax reform, but also by social welfare groups, including the Australian Council of Social Service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government finds itself in a position a little like Aladdin, inasmuch as the tax reform genie has been released from the bottle and simply will not go away. While the government has chosen to continue to grant two wishes, that is the rewriting and renumbering of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and the clarification of ambiguities, it has, as its predecessor in government did, baulked at the third and unarguably most critical wish, and that is an overhaul of our byzantine tax policy. We are left, Mr Deputy Speaker, to tiptoe through the TLIPs, without even a suggestion of falsetto help from Tiny Tim.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is the second instalment of legislation to result from the tax law improvement project, which was established by the former Labor government on 1 July 1994. It deals with 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2663"> the rewrite of deductions, trading stock, accessible and exempt income and depreciation and gift provisions in the principal act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My support for the efforts being made by the tax law improvement project team is qualified. However, I reaffirm my belief that it is absolutely essential that the terms of reference for this project should be extended by the government to include and allow for a review of some policy matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The progress to date by the project team is not really significant. It is a start, but nothing more. There should be absolutely no easing of pressure on this parliament to implement substantive changes to tax legislation. It is very clear that this country needs a bipartisan commitment to total tax reform if it is to remain competitive in an increasingly globalised economy. Moreover, the commitment must be to rapid but thoughtful change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the current rate of progress by the tax law improvement project is anything to go by, it will be something like 25 to 30 years before the rewrite is complete, given that there is no major rewrite or change to policy in the meantime. That is plainly unacceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the criticisms being levelled against the current rewrite of corporations legislation is the length of time involved. Mr Richard Humphry, Managing Director of the Stock Exchange, recently commented that the simplification of the existing laws was not solving the problem because the corporations legislation needed to be rewritten from scratch. He suggested that `Corporations Law would not stand up to any form of competitive analysis against international law.'</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Humphry concluded by saying that the corporate law simplification project was progressing at the speed of an old-fashioned steamer while the global marketplace operates at an electronic level of speed. His comments might apply to the TLIP project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Joint Committee of Public Accounts, in its recent report into the tax law improvement project, revealed an opposing anxiety. It stated that it was concerned that `TLIP's process may be suffering in the rush to have legislation introduced into the parliament.'</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The committee chairman, the honourable member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay), went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee has not had time to review the bill as comprehensively as it would have liked.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The committee acknowledged that while the mass of the second instalment of TLIP had been embraced in general terms, there were two divisions that had earned strong criticism by tax experts. It indicated that the government would have to `schedule sufficient time for parliamentary debate and review of the next tranche of legislation,' to ensure meaningful consultation and scrutiny in the tax law improvement project in future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government would do well to heed the advice of the JCPA, given that the government went to the last election on a platform of improved levels of consultation and accountability. It is of real concern that the JCPA is unhappy with the amount of time it has had to liaise with tax professionals on this instalment of TLIP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that an imbalance now exists between allowing for adequate consultation and the timely delivery of TLIP. If the government cannot strike a balance for the simple renumbering and rewriting of 16 divisions in the tax act, how does it expect to assure the community that real tax reform will be dealt with in a decisive manner?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> reported on 28 May 1996 that Australia's international competitiveness had deteriorated over the previous year, and cited our weak performance in the category of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2664"> internationalisation as particularly alarming. Six months later another report found that Australia was losing ground because of relatively high taxes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An improved structure, simpler language and a better numbering system are certainly a step in the right direction in terms of tax reform. But this is at best a partial solution. It is merely another example of treating the symptoms rather than effecting a cure. So while the member for Braddon (Mr Miles), in his speech during the second reading debate, talked about the benefits of reduced compliance and administration costs that business can expect to enjoy because of the tax law improvement project charter, I seek to remind him and others that tax experts are far less effusive when it comes to the project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Mr Geoffrey Lehmann, a partner of Price Waterhouse, was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 5 July last year to have said, the tax law improvement project:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . is an attempt to simplify the language and arrangement of tax legislation, while doing nothing to change the underlying complexity of tax laws that cause the real problems for taxpayers.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In a nutshell, plain English and improved drafting are not in themselves a substitute for simpler tax law with lower compliance costs. True simplification of the tax system is linked inextricably to a review of tax policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The JCPA made explicit its view on this matter. Its second recommendation stated that the TLIP should have its terms of reference expanded by the government to allow it to consider a wider range of tax policy simplification issues. Section 3.6 of the JCPA report reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee had received considerable evidence that unclear or unworkable sections of the 1936 act are being perpetuated in the bill because changing them is beyond TLIP's very limited mandate to make policy changes.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">By ruling out any review of tax policy, at least in its first term, the current government, like its predecessor, has made it clear that it will not make the wide ranging changes to the tax system that are needed to make it as simple, fair and economically efficient as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Taxation Institute of Australia presented a paper at the 1996 tax summit titled `The quintessential tax system, reform: the impossible dream'. In it the TIA argued that, for a tax system to achieve the three essential goals of simplicity, equity and efficiency:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A tax system in its design, legislation and administration, ought to be able to be complied with by ordinary taxpayers, having regard to the complexity of his/her affairs, without resort to professional assistance.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is an indictment of our income tax system that approximately 70 per cent of individual taxpayers now turn to tax professionals each year to prepare their income tax returns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Industry Commission's Office of Regulatory Review noted, in a report released in July 1996:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would not be surprising if broad surveys of compliance costs or attitudes to the tax system fail to show major falls in tax compliance costs after the tax law improvement project is complete.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This was a government instrumentality predicting that the four years, millions of dollars and countless man&hyphen;hours pumped into the hallowed tax law improvement project could be for naught.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time, the JCPA concluded that TLIP's rewrite will go only halfway to meeting the goal of the simplification of the 1936 act because of its narrow mandate. It said that the cost of compliance, and the burden of administration of the tax law, will not be reduced until 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2665"> the Commonwealth and state governments commit themselves to a `comprehensive review of tax policy'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Is it any wonder that two presenters at the 1996 tax summit referred to Australia's tax reform process as being almost entirely captured by the bureaucracy. Messrs Phillip Anderson and Richard Vann assert that Australia is desperate for an independent inquiry into the entire tax system. They argue convincingly that, until this occurs, the past practice of legislating ad hoc changes to a system that is ill&hyphen;equipped to sustain them will continue. As far as they are concerned, the tax law improvement project `demonstrates over and over again, we will not get the fundamental review of the income tax act that is absolutely necessary . . . while the tax policy process remains the preserve of a bureaucracy' obsessed with tax avoidance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Soon after the election of the coalition government, the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser) went on record as saying that those on the right side of the House recognised that small business was the engine room of the Australian economy. He said that the coalition would make things `a darn sight better' for small business than did his Labor Party predecessor. The centrepiece of this commitment was the establishment of the small business deregulation task force. In December last, the task force released 62 recommendations on how the government should reduce the compliance burden on the small business sector. Many of these proposals were reliant on an overhaul of the fringe benefits and wholesale sales tax systems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Likewise, in a joint submission to the government on the tax law improvement project, the TIA, the Institute of Chartered Accountants and the Society of Certified Practising Accountants have made it clear that plans to cut business compliance costs could not be addressed without substantial reform to the capital gains tax. As for the coalition commitment to reducing the paperwork burden on small businesses by half, in February last year the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS> had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The unanimous view is that a 50% reduction can be achieved only if the legislation that caused the paperwork&mdash;primarily tax legislation&mdash;is overhauled. Tinkering at the edges, getting rid of one form here and another form there, will not even come close to achieving the coalition's promised revenue&hyphen; neutral 50% reduction.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The small business deregulation task force makes no reference in its report to the positive impact that the tax law improvement project will have on small business, because it sees it for what it is: yet another fits and starts attempt at questionable reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At a tax summit, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the ACCI, warned the then Labor government about the danger to small business of tokenism in the tax reform process. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Piecemeal action should be avoided at all costs. This is the fundamental flaw we have faced since the wheels fell off the tax reform cart 10 years ago.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The lack of true tax reform, the representative of ACCI went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . is why small businesses in particular are feeling alienated and under siege from compliance imposts which have been calculated as worst than virtually any other country in the world.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It would seem that neither the former Labor government nor the current coalition government have heeded that warning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the minister for small business may bleat about promises kept, including changes to capital gains tax rollover relief, it is worth while remembering that this came at the price of what one tax professional described as 25 pages of `brain numbing legislative amendments'. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2666"> In the words of Mr Graeme Samuel, the President of the ACCI, `Why does the tax office invest millions of dollars in a tax law improvement project if it cannot staunch the flow of legislative gobbledegook' in one particular amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ACCI made it clear that consecutive government reviews have accentuated the anti&hyphen;competitive ramifications of the current tax system on Australia's small businesses. It stated that one of the key strategies to shoring up business confidence was for the three levels of government to reach agreement on a process to overhaul revenue raising systems. It would seem that business is going to have to continue to wait for the government to bite the bullet. The question is: how long can business afford to wait, given that the economy continues to remain somewhat flat and bankruptcies in the small business sector are at an all&hyphen;time high? Not much longer, I would suggest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth noting that the TLIP senior management team includes two positions for private sector practitioners. One of these positions has been vacant for approximately 15 months. The whole point of having these two positions is to ensure that TLIP considers as wide a range of perspectives as possible when considering the simplification of our tax legislation. The positions exist to ensure that the business community has an opportunity to contribute to this essential process. The JCPA report recommended that the government fill this position `as a matter of urgency.' I also understand that the TLIP team has written to the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp) requesting that this second private sector position be filled immediately. To date the government seems to have ignored that request. So much for the coalition's commitment to the private sector; so much for the government's promise to consult widely in an effort to stay in touch with industry's needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While some groups, including the AICD Taxation and Economics Committee, have called for `sweeping reform' to the Australian tax system, others have supported a more cautious approach. For example, Mr Robert Fitzgerald, the President of ACOSS, has said that Australia is in need of `genuine and progressive tax reform.' Tax experts have variously dubbed the income tax act as a super nova&mdash;a star bloated and about to implode&mdash;or as a gothic mansion to which new additions are constantly made without consideration as to whether the foundations can support them. Whatever the language used, the message is plain and simple: this parliament cannot back away from its responsibility to implement an efficient, simple and equitable tax system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude by quoting an editorial from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 4 September 1996 which sums up very succinctly the road ahead for tax reform in this country. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is also inescapably true that the contorted and unresponsive nature of the current system is the product of a half century of tinkering . . . A suitably independent inquiry, with broad, sensible terms of reference and adequate time to consult and consider . . . might well be the best remaining opportunity for an Australian government to achieve an honestly negotiated, worthwhile and electorally acceptable tax reform package.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to speak on the Tax Law Improvement Project Bill, I say that there is a fairly hackneyed phrase that there is nothing more certain in life than death and taxes. What should be tacked onto that phrase is that nothing has been more certain in recent years than continuous additions to the Income Tax Assessment Act. The phrases that have been used expansively and colourfully over a number of years are certainly very appropriate. I am indebted to the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) for some remarks that he has made. In general, I agree with what he says. He did speak about the need for bipartisan support for tax reform. I endorse that sentiment wholeheartedly. Indeed, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2667"> I commend the initiatives of the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) in trying to get an all&hyphen;party committee together to address this situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But always lurking in any initiative of that kind are the opportunistic in the community, particularly on the other side of politics, but it is not necessarily confined to the other side either if a situation arises. However, in recent times the opportunistic approach has been confined exclusively to the other side. The Leader of the Opposition exemplified that during the Western Australian election campaign when he suggested, in a somewhat contorted fashion, that the Western Australian government was trying to implement some sort of GST. Yet again, the initiatives that need to be taken are constantly being mired by opportunistic politicians, particularly in the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The comments by the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) about treating the symptoms rather than effecting a cure are very appropriate. The failure of fundamental reform has spawned the burgeoning act. The burgeoning act did not come about because of technical problems; it came about because of the underlying problems. In fact, the feet on the act have never really been properly addressed. It is the top-heavy nature of the act that is constantly being played with: it is rickety, it is rumbling and it is falling. Consequently, although this piece of legislation does go some way in the right direction to try and redress some of the problems, the underlying problems are the ones that ultimately must be addressed because they form the base upon which the act is erected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The comments by the honourable member for Curtin are relevant to consider in relation to the need for professional assistance and I will do that shortly. Not only is there the need for professional accountancy assistance to about 70 per cent of the population but frequently taxpayers have to seek counsel's advice, in addition to their accountant's advice, because the accountants cannot provide the sort of advice necessary in some areas because of the complexity of the act. So that tacks on an additional cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The act, as has been said in the parliamentary secretary's second reading speech, is on the verge of collapsing under the weight of constant piecemeal amendment. It is true that the rewrite will make the act more user&hyphen;friendly, more understandable, hopefully shorter, clearer and less burdensome. The amendments include the rewrite of assessable and exempt income, deductions, trading stock, depreciation and gifts. Other rules included in the bill are entertainment expenses, primary production deductions, the recoupment of deductible expenses and the sale of leased cars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are about 30 minor policy changes. I need not go through those in whole other than to mention references made to replacing impractical rules with ones which facilitate taxpayer compliance, the simplification of rules, deleting of unnecessary rules, the removal of anomalies and clarifying of ambiguities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The valuation methods for livestock will bring them in line with those for other kinds of trading stock. The change will have a revenue cost of up to $10 million in most years, and over $25 million in the occasional year where there is a large fall in stock prices. The proposed change in the use of trading stock taken for personal use will result in a gain to the revenue of about $30 million in 1998&hyphen;99 and $25 million in each subsequent year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I was studying taxation law in 1980 I can remember carrying around a CCH version of the act but I needed a reasonably strong wrist to do so, and the paper was not much thicker than rice paper at that time. Having observed a very strong table on which my accountant's Income Tax Assessment Act sits, and being reminded that he needs to take weight lifting 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2668"> lessons to carry it around, one can see and feel the enormity of the problem. I would hate to be a law student trying to wield that act between lecture theatres. I am told by a law student that in 1994 at the QUT the sections of the act that the students used&mdash;it was just too heavy to carry around&mdash;were about the same size of the act that I was using. That was not the complete act&mdash;the relevant sections that they were focusing on in their studies were a microcosm of the act itself. If only those sections were relevant to a law course, it makes me ask the question as to what use the other sections were to the public, but that is probably another manifestation of the great debate about the Income Tax Assessment Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting that the complexity of the act is causing more and more members of the public with taxation problems which, on the face of it, are relatively easy, to resort to the assistance of an accountant. Yet again you can see an anachronism in that sort of approach. People have to go to their accountant, they are in effect taxed again&mdash;they have to pay a fee to do that, so that is a form of tax out of their money&mdash;and then they get a deduction for doing so. So the revenue is depleted by that very complexity. Then you see the seeds of the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why are we not looking at a situation where the tax rate is dropped and there are no deductions? Would that not make it easier for everybody? We would probably drop half the act in the process and we would drop the necessity for all of this resort to advice and professional assistance. Maybe it is too simple, but it seems an obvious way of addressing the problem: take out the deductions and drop the tax. In the process, we would eliminate much heartache and anguish, the problems that go with that, the resentment that is felt by the community and the resorting to tax avoidance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sure, we are always going to have people who will try to avoid tax. But when you are looking at compliance costs, when you are looking at the keeping of records and so forth, you realise that all of that impacts on the Australian community. All of that hurts small business. All of that, in my view, is grinding our economy in a negative direction when we should be looking at turning it in a positive direction. We need to do that by the simplification of our tax laws. I say again that this is a step in the right direction but we certainly need to go much further.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can recall the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tax Pack</EMPHASIS> in the 1970s being a couple of pages. Look at it now. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tax Pack</EMPHASIS> is now an enormously complex document in itself, for some people. Admittedly it is a question of time for many people, but I would not fancy having to go through the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tax Pack</EMPHASIS> to see precisely where I, as a taxpayer, am at with it. When one looks at the reasons for the complexity, one could spend a long time in this debate. Let us, however, look at the methodology in calculating depreciation, as just one example.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are, in effect, so concerned with deductions that we are losing sight of what the act should be doing. It is there to make a simple, just, fair and equitable collection for income tax, and to provide a system that will assist the community in developing an economy that is generating income, employment, adventurism in decision making and an entrepreneurial spirit, not stifling it&mdash;not providing the plethora of rules and regulations and exceptions that stifle the movement in the economy that is needed to get the country going.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While again I emphasise my support for the proposal in principle, as one that will get us one step along the way, I shiver at the thought that it is one step in a 25-year process, as the member for Curtin mentioned. I do think that, with the enormous support in the community, right through from practising accountants to ACOSS itself, the messages are there. They can no longer be ignored; we can no longer fudge the issue. We have to tackle tax reform. We 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2669"> have to have bipartisan support. That is why the initiatives of the member for O'Connor are to be commended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In essence, I support these measures. I hope that contributions that have been made to this debate will be looked at by those who should finally convince themselves that the messages are loud and clear and it is time to start a full and thorough reform of the system.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Tax Law Improvement Bill 1996 is one of the bread&hyphen;and&hyphen;butter, non&hyphen;controversial, machinery of government type bills, which this parliament is properly occupied with. I note that the first instalment, the Income Tax Assessment Bill 1996, was passed through the Senate earlier in the week without opposition. I rise to support the bill. It is a commonsense reform. It reflects government's continuing obligation to make its legislation easier to understand, and easier to enforce and comply with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the result, in part, of a response from the Joint Committee of Public Accounts led by my colleague, the member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay). He has got that particular cast of mind which is rich in commonsense and practical insight. Pretty much whatever goes through his jurisdiction or purview, such as the recent amendments to the Auditor&hyphen;General Bill, reflects his capacity to recognise the anomaly and introduce commonsense where previously it had not existed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The practical amendments to this bill, we should acknowledge, did not originate on this side of the House but originated under the previous government in its tax law improvement project in July 1994, with the goals of restructuring, re&hyphen;numbering and rewriting in plain language the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. As previous speakers have mentioned, it is a herculean task. Before we came to government, that particular act expanded in size in those 13 years from 1,328 pages, which we thought was already a pretty enormous act, to 3,792 pages. The word around town is that tax accountants now measure the act not by the page numbers but by the kilogram.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of us today have got up and basically applauded the work of the bill in relation to assessable and exempt income, deductions, trading stock, depreciation and gifts. It is a helpful change. It communicates to small business and others that the government is working to reduce the compliance burden which they face.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) raised the question of the number of amendments being proposed. The advice to me from the minister is that the large number of amendments proposed reflects the procedural requirement for each textual change to be dealt with separately. For example, the minister says that 23 amendments are needed to implement the single JCPA recommendation to omit the provisions allowing hire purchasers to depreciate plant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that 23 amendments are required to introduce one change reflects the deeper underlying issue that we have touched on this morning. The member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) appealed for the terms of reference for this exercise to be extended into the realms of substantive policy. We accept that, to date, it has been essentially policy neutral and essentially revenue neutral. The member called upon the parliament and the government to expand the terms of reference and get into the real areas of difficulty in the tax act, which I think most of us would accept.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The great difficulty we have here is trying to make simple what is an inherently complex set of concepts. It is not surprising that the complexity of the underlying concepts revolves 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2670"> around the fact that our system of taxation is weighted so heavily in favour of the taxation of income. And income is a complex beast which is difficult to wrestle to the ground.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we look, for example, at the recommendations of the Small Business Deregulation Task Force&mdash;they made 60 recommendations which are currently before the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and we expect a response from his office perhaps next week&mdash;the first 11 of those 60 were all tax related, in terms of how the government can reduce the impact of compliance on small business. That reflects the sense of urgency which the small business community, in particular, feels about these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All the studies which have come back from small business say essentially the same thing: they do not resent having to pay tax but they resent the volume of regulation and legislation governing tax. They resent the complexity of the rule structure of tax and the frequency of changes to that rule structure. Those three messages consistently come back from the small business community. It is true that the complexity of the current regime impacts in a kind of discriminating way against small business, because these are the businesses which have not reached that critical mass where they can appoint someone as a full&hyphen;time compliance accountant. Larger businesses have that luxury. All the time spent in complying with the government's tax requirements is time that cannot be spent in marketing, selling product, building relationships, networking, R&amp;D and all of those other productive areas of the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We then get back to this question: should we then be making a much bolder, broader sweeping response to the problem? Let me put it on the record that I, like every other member who has stood, support this bill as far as it goes. I believe that it is an appropriate reference that has been undertaken by the tax law improvement project, but the bill inevitably raises this broader question of whether we ought to be approaching this in a more robust way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are moments in history when we sense that there was a critical decision that had to be taken by a nation and a community, and the decision taken will have a very long&hyphen;standing impact on the quality of life of a very large number of citizens. As I look back over this century, the Treaty of Versailles at the conclusion of the First World War is one about which I feel a great sense of sadness. I think that there was a situation where we had started the century off on a bad foot, if you like. We had had a civil war in Europe with millions killed, and then the statesmen, the elders of the nations, came together to hammer out the peace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> It was one of the few occasions in his life when I would agree with John Maynard Keynes. He was arguing for a much more gracious peace, if you like, and for a rebuilding of the German economy. But the leaders of the victorious states did not have that broad&hyphen;mindedness, that grace, that sense of statesmanship and they imposed a peace which most of us in retrospect would say was unjust.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Their lack of leadership at that moment, in my view, was one of the principal causes of the subsequent conflict in the Second World War. It sowed the seeds of resentment and the rest of this century, in effect, has been very much a result of that. Like the pebble in the pond, the waves have continued to flow out, largely due to the failure of leadership at that moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I look at our own country's history over the past 50 years or so, I feel a sense of sorrow at the McEwanist high tariff policies in the 1950s and 1960s; at our failure to really latch onto and develop the technology when the CSIRO developed the first computer, and the sense that we drifted along as a primary producer without really value adding or really getting onto the front end of the technology wave. But I also feel a great sense of sadness for that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2671"> moment in history when we had a key decision to make and we failed. I feel a sense of sadness about the 1993 election when John Hewson went to the Australian people with this incredibly ambitious but completely transparent package for national reform. It was a critical issue which everyone in the room would accept had to be one of our top national priorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> If you pick the top three priorities, you would probably say something like: employment, health finance and tax reform. There may be a different order around the room, but tax reform has to be in the top two or three challenges we face as a nation. And there we had this moment in time&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">A division having been called in the House of Representatives&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the division, I was talking about those moments in history at which we define ourselves. To me, the 1993 election was one of those moments. So often people are cynical about politicians and believe that we are motivated by base motives, that we are unwilling to take the long&hyphen;term view, that we are not concerned about matters of principle. Here we had an Australian politician who said, `I am not cynical about the electorate. I am going to put a very high level of trust and faith in the electorate. I am going to go to the Australian people with this comprehensive package of reform. I am going to give them that package a year out from the election and I am going to let them go over it with a fine toothcomb. I am going to totally expose myself to public scrutiny. I am not going to pull something out of the bag when we get into government; I am going to have faith and confidence in the good judgment and good sense of the Australian people.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I get a little bit irritated when I hear all the murmurings and rumblings about introducing a GST and how we have no stomach for it. When we went to the Australian people and offered them that deal, they did not have the stomach for it. I have a certain impatience with all of those accountants and experts and people who are now coming out and calling for this reform. They watched us get mowed down when we came out of the trenches carrying the GST, and they sat silently back in their comfortable bunkers and said, `We will derive the benefits of this reform once it goes through, but we will not share any of the risks.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even in the business community they were coming out and saying, `No, we do not want it. It is too hard and too complex. We do not want to have to collect it.' And then you had Keating&mdash;the absolute duplicity of the man&mdash;who, having fought tooth and nail in cabinet for this fundamental change and having lost, in a completely cynical electoral exercise turned that election into a referendum on the GST, knowing that in all of Australia's history since Federation we had never passed a referendum except with bipartisan support. Clearly, we are in the same position today. So there was that moment in time when we had this great opportunity as a culture for decision, and we failed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now we are locked in; we are all standing up and giving obeisance to this good piece of essentially technical housekeeping legislation when, in our heart of hearts, we all know there is a job to be done but we do not have the national will to do it. So I challenge groups like the Taxpayers Association of Australia, the accountants and the whole industry out there who are calling for reform. I say, `Why don't you go out and recruit the Australian people to that concept and get their commitment and come back to the parliament?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">National leadership in a parliament such as this is not just about initiating things and leading the people; it is also about responding to them and reflecting their views. When we have gone to the Australian people, only four years ago, with this exact proposal and been very clearly 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2672"> rejected, some could equally argue it would be presumptuous of any prime minister to relaunch that phoenix out of the ashes. I want to see the signing on the dotted line of those companies, corporations and small businesses who are all wandering around murmuring and saying, `Why don't we do something about it?' We went to the Australian people and they knocked us back because they did not have the stomach for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is like the second airport: everyone is in favour of the second airport until they actually see that the flight path goes over their house; then, of course, they are implacably opposed to it. We have these moments of decision when reform is painful. I am not necessarily saying a consumption tax is the panacea. But we have to move away from this incredible reliance on income as the basis of Commonwealth revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A GST is not the be&hyphen;all and end&hyphen;all. But it is a movement away from this preoccupation with income that actually stimulates savings and investment, encourages compliance because it is simple, is equitable because everybody pays it, and does not encourage a whole industry of tax evasion. That is what we need as a nation. It has got to be one of our top priorities. I am appealing to the business community and the Australian people to, if they want it, let us see the colour of the money; let us see them come out en masse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ross Perot, before he ran for the presidency of the United States, said to his constituency, `I'm not going to run until you can get 500,000 signatures saying you want me to run.' In a sense, it was smart politics&mdash;half the battle was won before he began. So I am saying to the Australian people: if you want a consumption tax, if you want fundamental reform of tax, I urge you to lobby the Australian Labor Party to a point where we know we can move forward with a bipartisan commitment, in the same way that we have had for this bill, for which I applaud the opposition. It was originally their bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we are talking about real national leadership in this place, nothing would restore the integrity and stature of this parliament in the eyes of the Australian people more than a bipartisan commitment to fundamental tax reform. So I call on the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) and the Australian people to rally together and demand it of us. Thank you.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not take up a lot of the time of the Main Committee on the Tax Law Improvement Bill 1996, but it is important to make a few comments. I certainly concur with a lot of what the previous speaker, the member for Parramatta (Mr Ross Cameron), has said. This bill had its genesis way back in 1992&hyphen;93 when the Joint Committee of Public Accounts of the 36th Parliament and, subsequently, the 37th Parliament put together a report on the inquiry that it held. It was report No. 326, called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">An assessment of tax</EMPHASIS> . A lot of people will recall some of the public hearings and the evidence that was received by the JCPA in putting that report together.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was fortunate enough to have been on the Joint Committee of Public Accounts at the tail end of that inquiry, in the 37th Parliament, and I also participated in the drafting of the recommendations. Among the recommendations with regard to the legislative framework that came out of that report No. 326, recommendation 22 said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee recommends the government establish a broadly based task force to redraft the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Recommendation 23 was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the committee recommends that the government commits sufficient resources to the task force as will allow it to complete a priority simplification redraft within two years and the full simplification of the act within five years. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2673">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It should be noted that there was also a minority report, as part of report 326, and what I feel was a fairly important recommendation came out of the minority report with regard to rulings. That minority report, in recommendation 3, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the relevant Commonwealth Tax Acts be amended to provide that general&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is public rulings&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">be issued as regulations under the taxation laws and subject to tabling and disallowance in the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As everybody would know, that recommendation in the minority report was not picked up, but it certainly is an area that way back then was of concern and, from my understanding of the private sector, at this stage is still of major concern. The existence of the ruling system and how it is applied and enforced is one of the areas of concern to the private sector and private practitioners. Obviously, the other area relates to the perception, following report 326, that the rewrite of the tax act would be addressing policy issues as well as the simplification of what is a very, very complicated bill. To a large extent that has not happened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The TLIP process started under the former government in the 37th Parliament and it has continued under the current government in the 38th Parliament. It was interesting to note the second reading speech of the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles), in which he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first instalment of the new law, the Income Tax Assessment Bill 1996, was passed by the House with bipartisan support and is presently waiting consideration by the Senate. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts reviewed that bill in detail, concluding that the bill was a significant improvement over the current law being widely regarded as far easier to read and understand.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is quite correct, but it certainly did not address any issues of policy. I know that this is one issue that has been raised in the debate so far on this bill. In the second reading speech, the parliamentary secretary went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The rewritten rules include 30 minor policy changes which will make the law simpler, clearer and less burdensome for taxpayers. They will do this by:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">. replacing impractical rules with ones which facilitate taxpayer compliance:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">. simplifying rules which are unnecessarily complex;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">. deleting unnecessary rules;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">. removing anomalies; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">. clarifying ambiguities.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I believe the crux of what the previous speaker was talking about was addressing policy issues in taxation, trying to drag the Income Tax Assessment Act at least into the 1990s and push it forward so that it is a forward looking piece of legislation to take into the next century. Unfortunately, at this stage in this process, that is not entirely happening. In fact, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, in its report 348 on this bill, stated in recommendation 2:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Government should expand the mandate of the Tax Law Improvement Project to allow it to consider a wider range of tax policy simplification issues than the mandate currently allows. Such a mandate should be applied to TLIP for all future tranches of rewritten legislation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And that is the most recent report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts on the whole TLIP process that has been taking place over the last couple of years. I support the process. I support the bill that is before the House. I believe that we should be going a little further, flexing the margins out a little further and having a look at addressing some of those policy areas.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2674">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As an aside to that, quite apart from this process I note that the Australian Tax Office is having a look at some policy changes and flexing the margins in another area, which is also partly covered by this bill. In division 70, I think it is, the bill deals with trading stock and there are a few references in the EM and descriptions of natural increase of livestock as trading stock and how the Australian Tax Office will deal with those.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just recently I had the opportunity of spending the day with a number of oyster farmers on the Hawkesbury River, and some of them were from Wallis Lake. The Wallis Lake farmers currently have an additional disadvantage which can be added to those that they are already burdened with emanating from the state government of New South Wales. Anyhow, I spent the day on the Hawkesbury River with a group of oyster farmers from there and from Wallis Lake and also with two officers from the Australian Taxation Office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Taxation Office at the moment has a discussion paper out on how it can draw into the tax system a declaration of trading stock by oyster farmers. That is going to be an extremely difficult thing. I am just using this is an example. I am not criticising the ATO, but I am saying that the ATO is able to push things out at the margins in this regard yet the mandate given in the rewriting and the simplification of the tax act in the TLIP process has been fairly clearly defined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Going back to the discussion paper and the assessment of how the ATO wants to deal with oyster farmers, it is a very difficult industry to operate in. It is very sensitive to climate changes&mdash;more so than a lot of other primary production&mdash;and it is going to be very difficult for the ATO to identify a point at which oysters actually become trading stock. The oysters are caught in the wild. It is the same as asking a deep-sea professional fisherman, `How are you going to assess your trading stock?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I spent the day with the oyster farmers. We looked at the different processes of oyster farming from actually catching spats that are free and wild in the rivers, to putting them onto sticks, to growing them out, and how they take them from there to fattening paddocks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most salient point that was made by the oyster farmers&mdash;and I take this opportunity to put it on the record&mdash;was that only last year they lost millions of dollars worth of stock in a matter of one hour in one day. They had a lot of their oysters on beds in what they call fattening paddocks. It was extremely hot weather in the middle of summer. There was a low tide at the wrong time of the day and those oysters were exposed to extreme heat for an hour too long. As a result, the industry lost millions of dollars worth of oysters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are exposed to those sorts of things and now they are being faced with the dilemma of how they are going to deal with what may be imposed as far as the Australian Taxation Office is concerned in a declaration of open trading stock. At what point in the process of catching a wild animal on stakes&mdash;and the vagaries of that&mdash;going through to the process to fattening and marketing an oyster should they be declaring the level and value of their trading stock?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point is that in this bill it is fairly clear and it makes it easy to enunciate the natural increase of livestock as trading stock, their value and how to go about it. It is all prescribed in here, but it is going to be a far more difficult exercise with the different operators in the oyster industry in Australia. I just flag to the officers from the ATO who are here today that it is an issue that those of us who represent areas with a major oyster farming industry are going to take a great deal of interest in. It is of concern to us.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2675">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To their credit, the oyster farmers accepted the offer from the ATO to look at how they operate their businesses and to discuss some of the issues that revolve around the businesses. Mr Deputy Speaker, you would know about that because you also have an oyster industry of sorts in Tasmania. It is not Sydney rock oysters but it is an oyster industry of sorts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an important element and it has wider ramifications in so far as how people who are heading off into different ventures in agriculture are treated in the system. Every reasonable, thinking person in Australia expects that if you make a profit, you pay tax. That is our contribution to running this country. It is another question as to whether you agree how different governments from time to time spend that money, but any reasonable person will expect to pay tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I concur with the previous speaker with regard to the development of a tax minimisation industry in Australia. However, the reason it exists is because the tax law is so complicated. The average layman just cannot understand the majority of the tax act. That is why the industry has grown to the extent that it has.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There should be no reason why it should not be a very simple process. I also believe that, as we move towards the turn of the century, there is going to be an increasing demand from different sections of the community&mdash;not just from industry, the taxation industry, big business and small business, but from individuals, the PAYE taxpayers&mdash;for an overhaul of the tax system in this country. Sadly, it is going to get to the stage where that becomes a very loud cry before it is addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say that because, sadly, on a couple of occasions&mdash;one very public and one probably internal in government in this country&mdash;there was an opportunity presented in 1993 and previous to that in the mid&hyphen;1980s, to have a full and reasonable review of the tax system but on both occasions that was rejected because of a perception of it being too difficult. At some stage in the future, the general taxpaying public will demand that that take place. As I say, sadly we will have to wait till then before there will be a response.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I support the bill. I would like to see greater focus given to the possibility of policy changes. In a legislative manner, we seem to be bound to just rewriting and simplifying the tax act through what we are doing in TLIP. But the ATO still has the capability to look at those other areas of tax collection, as I highlighted with regard to the oyster industry. It is a dynamic system that we run. Let us be open-minded and look at the possibilities of looking at that issue in future projects. As has been set out in a recommendation in report 348 from the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, let us have a look at addressing some policy issues in the future.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the minister, I say thank you to all the speakers who participated in this debate. It is always interesting to hear people representing their electorates very well. Indeed, as my colleague spoke about the oyster industry, he highlighted some of the difficulties of having a very fair tax system in this nation. I could not help but remember that I like oysters; let us not kill off an oyster industry in Australia. So I thank those from both sides of the House who have contributed to this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government believes that the Tax Law Improvement Bill 1996 will be of significant benefit to the entire Australian community. The bill is the second instalment of legislation to replace progressively the Income Tax Assessment Act of 1936. It comes on the heels of the first stage of the new tax act that was endorsed by the Senate on Monday. That event is an 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2676"> important milestone because it means that the benefits of the tax law improvement project will begin to flow to the Australian community for the 1997&hyphen;98 income year. It is a major step forward in the progress of giving the taxation laws of this country back to the community in understandable language.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would particularly like to acknowledge the extremely valuable work of the JCPA in its watching brief on the project, and especially of its chairman, the member for Fairfax, Mr Somlyay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1936 act was in desperate need of a comprehensive overhaul. It is long and almost impossible to understand for anyone but tax specialists&mdash;sometimes I doubt if they were really clear on what it might have meant. Even then, it takes years of specialisation before a professional can offer confident advice. This bill will be of major benefit to the community and, together with the earlier bill, it makes an enormous improvement on existing law. The tax law improvement project has restructured, renumbered and rewritten the law so that it is easily understandable and can be followed completely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because the law can be more easily understood, compliance with it will improve and, very importantly, business costs of complying with it will also reduce. People will be able, for the first time in decades, to have a sense of confidence that they understand their rights and obligations and what actions they are required to take. There have been suggestions about the lack of readiness among the professions and the community for the 1 July 1997 start&hyphen;up date for the bill. The government believes that the community and the professions are now, or are at least becoming, well prepared for the start&hyphen;up date of 1 July this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am aware that the commercial publishers are ready to go with material, including detailed commentaries on electronic databases, which will support the tax profession and the community. I am also aware that the rewritten law in this, and the earlier bills, is already being taught in many of the tax courses in our universities and other tertiary institutions. So the process is certainly well on the way: that extension of knowledge and understanding of this bill. Text books have been, or are being, written or updated to take account of those changes. The Australian Taxation Office is developing training material to support the implementation of the law. This material will be made publicly available in good time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The extensive public consultation has meant that this bill has been exhaustively examined in order to identify any possible detriment to taxpayers. It has stood up to this extensive scrutiny very well. This is testimony to the high professional standards maintained by the tax law improvement personnel. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has decided to postpone this change because there is no consensus on the technical expression needed to implement the proposal. The government will continue to consult towards an agreed formulation with a view to early restoration of provisions to deal with the issue.</PARA>

The third group will make miscellaneous amendments of a minor technical kind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is accepting all of the changes to the bill proposed by the joint committee except, for the time being, the recommendations about assets converted to or from trading stock. The government has also made changes to the explanatory memorandum along the lines recommended by the joint committee. The government is fully aware of concerns about private sector involvement and we will be taking action on this issue very shortly. The government is giving sympathetic consideration to other recommendations in report No. 348 that go to wider policy matters, and responses on these matters will be provided later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendments 23, 39, 53, 55, 57 to 59, 61 and 63 to 69 relate to the changes in use of trading stock. The amendments will remove the proposed rules about converting trading stock into private or capital assets and converting private or capital assets into trading stock. The bill 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2681"> had sought to include express rules to deal with these events; however, there has been ongoing debate about the drafting of these rules. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts made recommendations on those issues, but some business groups still have concerns. Accordingly, the government has decided not to proceed at this time with these measures in the bill but rather to further pursue broad agreement with professional bodies.</PARA>

These amendments will remove references to hire purchase in the depreciation provisions. The bill had sought to provide legislative backing for the longstanding practice of allowing persons who hold property under a hire purchase agreement to depreciate it. However, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts thought it inappropriate for the bill to deal with hire purchase in isolation from other kinds of broadly similar finance arrangements. The government accepts that recommendation. Hirers under hire purchase agreements will continue to attract depreciation deductions under the long&hyphen;established administrative arrangements.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1997 amends the Excise Tariff Act to ensure the continuing excisability of all beverages containing distilled alcohol, including spirits, regardless of their alcohol content. It is a bill which the opposition supports. It closes a loophole that was created by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ruling that, for example, Carlton United's Sub Zero alcoholic soda, which has an alcohol content of about 5&half; per cent, could not be described as `spirituous' and therefore was not excisable as a spirituous beverage. This is bad news for drinkers of Sub Zero, but the closure is about protecting the revenue base and applying some consistency to the description of alcoholic beverages.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also applies to a range of other packaged mixed drinks, so it is not just the trendies with the Sub Zero who will be affected, but people who are into mixed spirit drinks, such as the United Distiller brands of rum and cola, gin and tonics and all those sorts of things. I think all of those people who have tried these recognise they contain spirits, especially if they have a lot of them. If sold separately, those spirits would be excisable, but the AAT ruled that the mix, to use their terminology, contained less alcohol than the community definition of spirit. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2682"> At least 37 per cent alcohol by volume is the community definition. It was therefore not subject to excise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The mechanism which has been used to close the loophole is to redefine the rate of duty in the schedule of the act from an amount per litre of alcohol to an amount per litre of distilled alcohol. There are further applications for similar rulings before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, and the Commonwealth has lodged an appeal in the Federal Court against the CUB Sub Zero ruling. None of these is yet concluded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation acts retrospectively from 3 February to effectively quash all claims currently before either the AAT or the Federal Court. All disputed excise has been paid into a deposit account of the Commonwealth so there is no repayment or back payment of disputed excise duty to the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The financial impact of this bill is that it reduces revenue by $290,000 for an, at this stage, still unexplained change to the excise on brandy based beverages, presumably to bring them into line with other spirituous beverages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further clarification is being sought from the minister but a response has not been received. I would simply ask in this debate that we get that clarification. It is an important one, because it involves reduction in revenue. But other than that, the bill avoids a contingent liability of $12.6 million from the AAT and the Federal Court actions.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to join this debate on the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No.1) 1997 and I note that the shadow minister, the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) has indicated that the opposition will be supporting the amendments to the bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose of the bill is to amend the schedule to the Excise Tariff Act 1921 to ensure the continuing excisability of all beverages containing distilled alcohol, including spirits, regardless of their alcoholic content. The important thing here is that this is a bit of housekeeping legislation and the intention is quite simply to close off a loophole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The financial impact of this bill is virtually zero; there is no financial impact. The amendments proposed in the act only clarify the law as outlined and involve no change to the excise treatment of beverages containing distilled alcohol. As I said earlier, it will have no financial impact. However, conversely it could mean that, unless there is retrospective amendment to the act, the government will have a contingent liability of some $12.6 million. When I first saw the bill, there was a degree of retrospectivity about it. As someone who strongly voices concerns when the word `retrospectivity' comes into play, I must say that was a warning signal for me to have a look in more detail as to what it really means with respect to retrospectivity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe in this instance that the amendments are justifiable on the grounds that they are backdated to 3 February 1996 because this will remove the technical loophole in the tariff act which was uncovered by the decision of the court to make the request by the company seeking the removal of the tariff acceptable. There is no reason to doubt that the court has acted in the best interests of the parliament in bringing down the decision that it has. This will not require the retrospective recovery of any excise duty from the manufacturers of the alcoholic beverages as the excise duty has continued to be paid by the manufacturers under deposit. This will protect the government under any claims for recovery of this duty. As I said earlier on, the bill is more in the nature of a housekeeping bill, and I strongly support the amendments.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the members who have spoken to this bill. As my colleague the honourable member for Lowe (Mr Zammit) mentioned, the amendments that we are proposing here have been made necessary because of a challenge brought on by Carlton and United Breweries with regard to the product known as Sub Zero. But I would like to reiterate for the record&mdash;I did note that my colleague, the honourable member for Lowe, mentioned this&mdash;that the purpose of this bill is to amend the Customs Tariff Act 1921 to ensure the continuing excisability of all beverages which contain distilled alcohol, including spirits, regardless of their alcohol content. It was the alcohol content that was the problem with regard to the Sub Zero case. This is really to make what we are aiming to do in legislation crystal clear.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under item 2 of the schedule of the Tariff Act, spirituous beverages are subject to duties of excise which are calculated at a dollar amount per litre of alcohol in each of the beverages. In November 1994, Carlton and United Breweries, CUB, commenced the manufacture of a product known as Sub Zero alcoholic soda which had an alcoholic content of approximately 5.5 per cent. The Australian Customs Service considered SubZ ero an excisable product. Carlton and United Breweries appealed against the decision of the Australian Customs Service to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, and the AAT determined that the product Sub Zero, with such a low alcoholic content by volume, could not be described as spirituous and was therefore not excisable. The Australian Customs Service is appealing against that decision in the Federal Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the AAT decision, Carlton and United Breweries has ceased the manufacture of Sub Zero using alcohol derived by distillation. However, there are several other manufacturers of beverages of low alcohol content, and the Customs Service has continued to impose excise duty on these beverages. In order to ensure the continuing excisability of all beverages containing distilled alcohol, I have brought this bill forward to amend the act. The combination of these amendments will remove any connotation as to the strength that an alcoholic beverage must be before it is excisable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is proposed that the amendments will take effect on and from 3 February 1996. The effect of the retrospective commencement date of the amendments will be to extinguish all rights of appeal to the AAT in relation to the excisability of low alcohol beverages and all rights to refunds of excise duty in respect of such beverages. The commencement date of the amendments on 3 February 1996 would not require the retrospective recovery of any excise duty from the manufacturers of the alcoholic beverages. The excise duty has continued to be paid by the manufacturers under deposit, and the 3 February 1996 commencement date will protect the government against all claims for recovery of this duty.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I propose to speak only briefly in relation to this bill. The International Transfer of Prisoners Bill 1996 provides mechanisms through which Australians imprisoned abroad may be returned to Australia to serve out their sentences. The bill also provides for foreign nationals imprisoned in Australia to be returned to their home countries, also to complete their sentences.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill makes this provision both in relation to prisoners convicted of war crimes and also prisoners convicted of general offences. In the case of prisoners convicted of war crimes, the bill complements Australia's commitment to prosecuting international war criminals. Australia has vigorously assisted the international efforts in this regard through our participation pursuant to the International War Crimes Tribunal Act 1995 in the tribunals established to deal with war crimes committed in the former Yugoslavia and in Rwanda. That legislation was moved by the former Labor government and received bipartisan support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some concerns were expressed at the hearings of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs into this bill. The concerns were that the bill might undermine the effort to fight serious crime, particularly drug related crime. These arguments seem to rest on the erroneous assumptions that the transfer of these prisoners will result in prisoners receiving less severe sentences. This is clearly not the effect of the bill. Whilst it is true that in being closer to home, family and friends prisoners are more likely to be held in more culturally sensitive conditions, these conditions are hardly likely to promote criminal activity. It would be a rather strange individual who decided that they were prepared to commit a serious criminal offence where previously they were not, simply because they knew that pursuant to this bill they might ultimately be returned home. Rather, this bill recognises that despite the serious wrongdoing these prisoners have committed, wrongdoings that are deserving of the gravest censure and punishment, those prisoners have rights to humanitarian treatment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also recognises that the best way to rehabilitate these prisoners is to return them to culturally appropriate and supportive environments, and as far as the general community is concerned surely this is one of the prime considerations we should be concerned about to minimise the prospect that criminals will offend again and that other innocent people will suffer from their actions. Punishment is an important part of the criminal process; however, punishment that increases the prospect of recidivism is not in the interests of society nor the prisoner concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs provided an advisory report to the parliament on this bill and I think it is worthwhile reading onto the record page 5 of that report. I think that summarises the consideration in favour of international transfer of prisoners and really encapsulates my view of the situation. It says at paragraph 1.15:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principal argument in favour of the international transfer of prisoners is humanitarian. The deprivation of liberty can be more harsh for prisoners imprisoned in foreign countries because of absence of contact with, and support from, relatives and friends, language barriers, differences in diet and health care, alienation from local culture, intolerance of religious practices, ineffective vocational training and general prejudice against foreigners. A prisoner can be adversely affected both psychologically and physically, and his or her rehabilitation might be impaired.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The international transfer of prisoners is said to enhance the prospects of rehabilitation of prisoners and their re&hyphen;integration into the community, as rehabilitation is thought to depend on the prisoner having the benefit of family or community support. This support is more likely where prisoners are in the same country as their families. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2685">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Those paragraphs out of the report encapsulate my view of the matter perfectly, and that is one of the reasons why we on this side of the House support this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also facilitates greater cooperation between Australia and foreign law enforcement and custodial agencies. This increased confidence and support of international law enforcement and custodial agencies will ultimately increase our combined ability to tackle the ever growing rate of international crime. This will help ensure that more criminals are brought to justice and help make the world, including Australia, a safer place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The aspects of this bill relating to the transfer of prisoners convicted of non&hyphen;war crimes related offences will ultimately rely for their success on the cooperation of the states and territories. The state and territory attorneys&hyphen;general have given in principle agreement to the operation of the legislation. I urge all attorneys concerned to conclude the final agreements with the necessary legislative support as soon as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, Mr Deputy Speaker, I note that the government's proposed amendment to the bill clarifies the wording of clause 24 in accordance with recommendation seven of the unanimous advisory report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. The Australian Labor Party welcomes this amendment, just as we welcome this bill. I commend the bill to the House.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Yes</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories and the NSW Department of Urban Affairs and Planning cooperated, over the period of 1995 and 1996, in an assessment of the values of the Sydney Opera House in its Harbour Setting and the preparation of a World Heritage nomination. Preparation of the draft nomination was the responsibility of the then New South Wales Department of Urban Affairs and Planning. The Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories was represented on a steering committee of officials which oversaw the work. The Commonwealth Government has not lodged that nomination with the World Heritage Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)(a) Yes</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)(b) Yes</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) No. The Commonwealth Government did not receive the nomination from the New South Wales Government until 26 July 1996, which was too late to allow submission to the World Heritage Committee for consideration that year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) The Commonwealth Government has decided not to forward the nomination to the World Heritage Committee at this time. The Prime Minister wrote,  in  a  letter  of  19 August 1996 to the New 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2690"> South Wales Premier, that he would wish to ensure complete accord between Governments over funding and management arrangements, if a nomination is to proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Uncertainties are raised by the New South Wales nomination of the building in its harbour setting, particularly the difficulty of establishing satisfactory management arrangements in a dynamic urban setting which includes a working harbour. Accordingly, the Commonwealth has decided that its limited resources for World Heritage matters are best devoted to the nominations we have in progress (notably the Subantarctic Islands), the assessments we have under way and the proper management of the eleven properties already on the World Heritage List.</PARA>
